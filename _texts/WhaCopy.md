# Wharton, Edith.  "'Copy': A Dialogue."    
 * Scribner's Magazine* 27 (June 1900): 657-663.  

       MRS. AMBROSE DALE—* forty, slender, still young—sits in her  drawing-room at the tea-table.  The winter twilight is  falling, a lamp has been lit, there is a fire on the hearth,  and the room is pleasantly dim and flower-scented.  Books are  scattered everywhere—mostly with autograph inscriptions "From  the Author"—and a large portrait of MRS. DALE at her  desk, with papers strewn about her, takes up one of the wall-panels.  Before MRS. DALE stands HILDA, fair and  twenty, her hands full of letters.*  

  MRS. DALE.  Ten more applications for autographs?  Isn't strange that people who'd blush to borrow twenty dollars don't  scruple to beg for an autograph?  

HILDA * (reproachfully)*.  Oh—  

MRS. DALE.  What's the difference, pray?  

HILDA.  Only that * your* last autograph sold for fifty—  

MRS. DALE * (not displeased)*.  Ah?—I sent for you, Hilda,  because I'm dining out to-night, and if there's nothing important  to attend to among these letters you needn't sit up for me.  

HILDA.  You don't mean to work?  

MRS. DALE.  Perhaps; but I sha'n't need you.  You'll see that  my cigarettes and coffee-machine are in place, and that I don't  have to crawl about the floor in search of my pen-wipe?  That's  all.  Now about these letters—  

HILDA * (impulsively)*.  Oh, Mrs. Dale—  

MRS. DALE.  Well?  

HILDA.  I'd rather sit up with you.  

MRS. DALE.  Child, I've nothing for you to do.  I shall be  blocking out the tenth chapter of "Winged Purposes," and it won't  be ready for you till next week.  

HILDA.  It isn't that—but it's so beautiful to sit here,  watching and listening, all alone in the night, and to feel that  you're in there * (she points to the study-door) creating—.   (Impulsively)*.  What do I care for sleep?  

MRS. DALE * (indulgently)*.  Child—silly child!—  Yes, I  should have felt so at your age—it would have been an  inspiration—  

HILDA * (rapt)*.  It is!  

MRS. DALE.  But you must go to bed; I must have you fresh in  the morning; for you're still at the age when one * is* fresh in  the morning!  * (She sighs.)*  The letters?  * (Abruptly.)*  Do  you take notes of what you feel, Hilda—here, all alone in the  night, as you say?  

HILDA * (shyly)*.  I have—  

MRS. DALE * (smiling)*.  For the diary?  

HILDA * (nods and blushes)*.  

MRS. DALE * (caressingly)*.  Goose!—Well, to business.  What  is there?  

HILDA.  Nothing important, except a letter from Stroud &  Fayerweather to say that the question of the royalty on  "Pomegranate Seed" has been settled in your favor.  The English  publishers of "Immolation" write to consult you about a six-shilling edition; Olafson, the Copenhagen publisher, applies for  permission to bring out a Danish translation of "The Idol's Feet";  and the editor of the * Semaphore* wants a new serial—I think  that's all; except that * Woman's Sphere* and * The Droplight*,  ask for interviews—with photographs—  

MRS. DALE.  The same old story!  I'm so tired of it all.  *  (To herself, in an undertone.)*  But how should I feel if it all  stopped?  * (The servant brings in a card.)*  

MRS. DALE * (reading it)*.  Is it possible?  Paul Ventnor?   * (To the servant.)*  Show Mr. Ventnor up.  * (To herself.)*   Paul Ventnor!  

HILDA * (breathless)*.  Oh, Mrs. Dale—* the* Mr. Ventnor?  

MRS. DALE * (smiling)*.  I fancy there's only one.     

HILDA.  The great, great poet?  * (Irresolute.)*  No, I don't  dare—  

MRS. DALE * (with a tinge of impatience)*.  What?  

HILDA * (fervently)*.  Ask you—if I might—oh, here in this  corner, where he can't possibly notice me—stay just a moment?   Just to see him come in?  To see the meeting between you—the  greatest novelist and the greatest poet of the age?  Oh, it's too  much to ask!  It's an historic moment.  

MRS. DALE.  Why, I suppose it is.  I hadn't thought of it in  that light.  Well * (smiling)*, for the diary—  

HILDA.  Oh, thank you, * thank you!*  I'll be off the very  instant I've heard him speak.  

MRS. DALE.  The very instant, mind.  * (She rises, looks at  herself in the glass, smooths her hair, sits down again, and  rattles the tea-caddy.)*  Isn't the room very warm?—  * (She  looks over at her portrait.)*  I've grown stouter since that was  painted—  You'll make a fortune out of that diary, Hilda—  

HILDA * (modestly)*.  Four publishers have applied to me  already—  

THE SERVANT * (announces)*.  Mr. Paul Ventnor.  

* (Tall, nearing fifty, with an incipient stoutness buttoned  into a masterly frock-coat*, VENTNOR * drops his glass and  advances vaguely, with a short-sighted stare.)*  

VENTNOR.  Mrs. Dale?  

MRS. DALE.  My dear friend!  This is kind.  * (She looks over  her shoulder at* HILDA, * who vanishes through the door to the  left.)*  The papers announced your arrival, but I hardly hoped—  

VENTNOR * (whose short-sighted stare is seen to conceal a  deeper embarrassment.)*  You hadn't forgotten me, then?  

MRS. DALE.  Delicious!  Do * you* forget that you're public  property?  

VENTNOR.  Forgotten, I mean, that we were old friends?  

MRS. DALE.  Such old friends!  May I remind you that it's  nearly twenty years since we've met?  Or do you find cold  reminiscences indigestible?  

VENTNOR.  On the contrary, I've come to ask you for a dish of  them—we'll warm them up together.  You're my first visit.  

MRS. DALE.  How perfect of you!  So few men visit their women  friends in chronological order; or at least they generally do it  the other way round, beginning with the present day and working  back—if there's time—to prehistoric woman.  

VENTNOR.  But when prehistoric woman has become historic  woman—?  

MRS. DALE.  Oh, it's the reflection of my glory that has  guided you here, then?  

VENTNOR.  It's a spirit in my feet that has led me, at the  first opportunity, to the most delightful spot I know.  

MRS. DALE.  Oh, the first opportunity—!  

VENTNOR.  I might have seen you very often before; but never  just in the right way.  

MRS. DALE.  Is this the right way?  

VENTNOR.  It depends on you to make it so.  

MRS. DALE.  What a responsibility!  What shall I do?  

VENTNOR.  Talk to me—make me think you're a little glad to  see me; give me some tea and a cigarette; and say you're out to  everyone else.  

MRS. DALE.  Is that all?  * (She hands him a cup of tea.)*   The cigarettes are at your elbow—  And do you think I shouldn't  have been glad to see you before?  

VENTNOR.  No; I think I should have been too glad to see *  you*.  

MRS. DALE.  Dear me, what precautions!  I hope you always wear  goloshes when it looks like rain, and never by any chance expose  yourself to a draught.  But I had an idea that poets courted the  emotions—  

VENTNOR.  Do novelists?  

MRS. DALE.  If you ask * me*—on paper!  

VENTNOR.  Just so; that's safest.  My best things about the  sea have been written on shore.  * (He looks at her  thoughtfully.)*  But it wouldn't have suited us in the old days,  would it?  

MRS. DALE * (sighing)*.  When we were real people!  

VENTNOR.  Real people?  

MRS. DALE.  Are * you*, now?  I died years ago.  What you see  before you is a figment of the reporter's brain—a monster  manufactured out of newspaper paragraphs, with ink in its veins.   A keen sense of copyright is * my* nearest approach to an emotion.     

VENTNOR. * (sighing)*.  Ah, well, yes—  As you say, we're  public property.  

MRS. DALE.  If one shared equally with the public!  But the  last shred of my identity is gone.  

VENTNOR.  Most people would be glad to part with theirs on  such terms.  I have followed your work with immense interest.   "Immolation" is a masterpiece.  I read it last summer when it first  came out.  

MRS. DALE * (with a shade less warmth)*.  "Immolation" has  been out for three years.  

VENTNOR.  Oh, by Jove—no?  Surely not—  But one is so  overwhelmed—one loses count.  * (Reproachfully.)*  Why have you  never sent me your books?  

MRS. DALE.  For that very reason.  

VENTNOR * (deprecatingly)*.  You know I didn't mean it for  you!  And * my* first book—do you remember—was dedicated to you.  

MRS. DALE.  "Silver Trumpets"—  

VENTNOR * (much interested)*.  Have you a copy still, by any  chance?  The first edition, I mean?  Mine was stolen years ago.  Do  you think you could put your hand on it?  

MRS. DALE * (taking a small shabby book from the table at her  side)*.  It's here.  

VENTNOR * (eagerly)*.  May I have it?  Ah, thanks.  This is  * very* interesting.  The last copy sold in London for #40, and  they tell me the next will fetch twice as much.  It's quite *  introuvable*.  

MRS. DALE.  I know that.  * (A pause.  She takes the book  from him, opens it, and reads, half to herself—)*  

    - * How much we two have seen together,  *
  -    Of other eyes unwist.  
- Dear as in days of leafless weather  
-    The willow's saffron mist,
    - Strange as the hour when Hesper swings  
-    A-sea in beryl green,  
- While overhead on dalliant wings  
-    The daylight hangs serene,
    - And thrilling as a meteor's fall  
-    Through depths of lonely sky,  
- When each to each two watchers call—  
-    I saw it!—So did I.
     VENTNOR.  Thin, thin—the troubadour tinkle.  Odd how little  promise there is in first volumes!  

MRS. DALE * (with irresistible emphasis)*.  I thought there  was a distinct promise in this!  

VENTNOR * (seeing his mistake)*.  Ah—the one you would never  let me fulfil?  * (Sentimentally.)*  How inexorable you were!  You  never dedicated a book to * me*.  

MRS. DALE.  I hadn't begun to write when we were—dedicating  things to each other.  

VENTNOR.  Not for the public—but you wrote for me; and,  wonderful as you are, you've never written anything since that I  care for half as much as—  

MRS. DALE * (interested)*.  Well?  

VENTNOR.  Your letters.  

MRS. DALE  * (in a changed voice)*.  My letters—do you  remember them?  

VENTNOR.  When I don't, I reread them.  

MRS. DALE * (incredulous)*.  You have them still?  

VENTNOR * (unguardedly)*.  You haven't mine, then?  

MRS. DALE * (playfully)*.  Oh, * you* were a celebrity  already.  Of course I kept them!  * (Smiling.)*  Think what they  are worth now!  I always keep them locked up in my safe over there.   * (She indicates a cabinet)*.  

VENTNOR * (after a pause)*.  I always carry yours with me.  

MRS. DALE * (laughing)*.  You—  

VENTNOR.  Wherever I go.  * (A longer pause.  She looks at  him fixedly.)*  I have them with me now.  

MRS. DALE * (agitated)*.  You—have them with you—now?  

VENTNOR * (embarrassed)*.  Why not?  One never knows—  

MRS. DALE.  Never knows—?  

VENTNOR * (humorously)*.  Gad—when the bank-examiner may  come round.  You forget I'm a married man.  

MRS. DALE.  Ah—yes.  

VENTNOR * (sits down beside her)*.  I speak to you as I  couldn't to anyone else—without deserving a kicking.  You know how  it all came about.  * (A pause.)*  You'll bear witness that it  wasn't till you denied me all hope—  

MRS. DALE * (a little breathless)*.  Yes, yes—  

VENTNOR.  Till you sent me from you—  

MRS. DALE.  It's so easy to be heroic when one is young!  One  doesn't realize how long life is going to last afterward.     * (Musing.)*  Nor what weary work it is gathering up the  fragments.  

VENTNOR.  But the time comes when one sends for the china-mender, and has the bits riveted together, and turns the cracked  side to the wall—  

MRS. DALE.  And denies that the article was ever damaged?  

VENTNOR.  Eh?  Well, the great thing, you see, is to keep  one's self out of reach of the housemaid's brush.  * (A pause.)*   If you're married you can't—always.  * (Smiling.)*  Don't you  hate to be taken down and dusted?  

MRS. DALE * (with intention)*.  You forget how long ago my  husband died.  It's fifteen years since I've been an object of  interest to anybody but the public.  

VENTNOR * (smiling)*.  The only one of your admirers to whom  you've ever given the least encouragement!  

MRS. DALE.  Say rather the most easily pleased!  

VENTNOR.  Or the only one you cared to please?  

MRS. DALE.  Ah, you * haven't* kept my letters!  

VENTNOR * (gravely)*.  Is that a challenge?  Look here, then!   * (He draws a packet from his pocket and holds it out to her)*.  

MRS. DALE * (taking the packet and looking at him  earnestly)*.  Why have you brought me these?  

VENTNOR.  I didn't bring them; they came because I came—  that's all.  * (Tentatively.)*  Are we unwelcome?  

MRS. DALE * (who has undone the packet and does not appear to  hear him)*.  The very first I ever wrote you—the day after we met  at the concert.  How on earth did you happen to keep it?  * (She  glances over it.)*  How perfectly absurd!  Well, it's not a  compromising document.  

VENTNOR.  I'm afraid none of them are.  

MRS. DALE * (quickly)*.  Is it to that they owe their  immunity?  Because one could leave them about like safety matches?--Ah, here's another I remember—I wrote that the day after we went  skating together for the first time.  * (She reads it slowly.)*   How odd!  How * very* odd!  

VENTNOR.  What?  

MRS. DALE.  Why, it's the most curious thing—I had a letter  of this kind to do the other day, in the novel I'm at work on now—  the letter of a woman who is just—just beginning—  

VENTNOR.  Yes—just beginning—?  

MRS. DALE.  And, do you know, I find the best phrase in it,  the phrase I somehow regarded as the fruit of—well, of all my  subsequent discoveries—is simply plagiarized, word for word, from  this!  

VENTNOR * (eagerly)*.  I told you so!  You were all there!  

MRS. DALE * (critically)*.  But the rest of it's poorly  done—very poorly.  * (Reads the letter over.)*  H'm—I didn't  know how to leave off.  It takes me forever to get out the door.  

VENTNOR * (gayly)*.  Perhaps I was there to prevent you!  *  (After a pause.)*  I wonder what I said in return?  

MRS. DALE * (interested)*.  Shall we look?  * (She  rises.)*   Shall we—really?  I have them all here, you know.  * (She goes  toward the cabinet.)*  

VENTNOR * (following her with repressed eagerness)*.  Oh—*  all!*  

MRS. DALE * (throws open the door of the cabinet, revealing  a number of packets)*.  Don't you believe me now?  

VENTNOR.  Good heavens!  How I must have repeated myself!  But  then you were so very deaf.  

MRS. DALE * (takes out a packet and returns to her seat.*   VENTNOR * extends an impatient hand for the letters)*.  No—no;  wait!  I want to find your answer to the one I was just reading.   * (After a pause.)*  Here it is—yes, I thought so!  

VENTNOR.  What did you think?  

MRS. DALE * (triumphantly)*.  I thought it was the one in  which you quoted "Epipsychidion"—  

VENTNOR.  Mercy!  Did I * quote* things?  I don't wonder you  were cruel.  

MRS. DALE.  Ah, and here's the other—the one I—the one I  didn't answer—for a long time.  Do you remember?  

VENTNOR * (with emotion)*.  Do I remember?  I wrote it the  morning after we heard "Isolde"—  

MRS. DALE * (disappointed)*.  No—no.  * That* wasn't the  one I didn't answer!  Here—this is the one I mean.  

VENTNOR * (takes it curiously)*.  Ah—h'm—this is very like  unrolling a mummy   —* (he glances at her)*—with a live  grain of wheat in it, perhaps?—  Oh, by Jove!  

MRS. DALE.  What?  

VENTNOR.  Why, this is the one I made a sonnet out of  afterward!  By Jove, I'd forgotten where that idea came from.  You  may know the lines perhaps?  They're in the fourth volume of my *  complete edition*—It's the thing beginning  
  
  * Love came to me with unrelenting eyes—*  
  
  one of my best, I rather fancy.  Of course, here, it's very crudely  put—the values aren't brought out—ah! this touch is good  though—very good.  H'm, I daresay there might be other material.   * (He glances toward the cabinet.)*  

MRS. DALE * (dryly)*.  The live grain of wheat, as you said!  

VENTNOR.  Ah, well—my first harvest was sown on rocky  ground—* now* I plant for the fowls of the air.  * (Rising and  walking toward the cabinet.)*  When can I come and carry off all  this rubbish?  

MRS. DALE.  Carry it off?  

VENTNOR * (embarrassed)*.  My dear lady, surely between you  and me explicitness is a burden.  You must see that these letters  of ours can't be left to take their chance like an ordinary  correspondence—you said yourself we were public property.  

MRS. DALE.  To take their chance?  Do you suppose that, in my  keeping, your letters take any chances?  * (Suddenly.)*  Do mine—  in yours?  

VENTNOR * (still more embarrassed)*.  Helen—!  * (He takes  a turn through the room.)*  You force me to remind you that you and  I are differently situated—that in a moment of madness I  sacrificed the only right you ever gave me—the right to love you  better than any other woman in the world.  * (A pause.  She says  nothing and he continues, with increasing difficulty—)*  You asked  me just now why I carried your letters about with me—kept them,  literally, in my own hands.  Well, suppose it's to be sure of their  not falling into some one else's?  

MRS. DALE.  Oh!  

VENTNOR * (throws himself into a chair)*.  For God's sake  don't pity me!  

MRS. DALE * (after a long pause)*.  Am I dull—or are you  trying to say that you want to give me back my letters?  

VENTNOR * (starting up)*.  I?  Give you back—?  God forbid!   Your letters?  Not for the world!  The only thing I have left!  But  you can't dream that in * my* hands—  

MRS. DALE * (suddenly)*.  You want yours, then?  

VENTNOR * (repressing his eagerness)*.  My dear friend, if  I'd ever dreamed that you'd kept them—!  

MRS. DALE * (accusingly)*.  You * do* want them.  * (A  pause.  He makes a deprecatory gesture.)*  Why should they be less  safe with me than mine with you?  * I* never forfeited the right  to keep them.  

VENTNOR * (after another pause)*.  It's compensation enough,  almost, to have you reproach me!  * (He moves nearer to her, but  she makes no response.)*  You forget that I've forfeited * all* my  rights—even that of letting you keep my letters.  

MRS. DALE.  You * do* want them!  * (She rises, throws all  the letters into the cabinet, locks the door and puts the key in  her pocket.)*  There's my answer.  

VENTNOR.  Helen—!  

MRS. DALE.  Ah, I paid dearly enough for the right to keep  them, and I mean to!  * (She turns to him passionately.)*  Have  you ever asked yourself how I paid for it?  With what months and  years of solitude, what indifference to flattery, what resistance  to affection?—Oh, don't smile because I said affection, and not  love.  Affection's a warm cloak in cold weather; and I * have*  been cold; and I shall keep on growing colder!  Don't talk to me  about living in the hearts of my readers!  We both know what kind  of a domicile that is.  Why, before long I shall become a classic!   Bound in sets and kept on the top book-shelf—brr, doesn't that  sound freezing?  I foresee the day when I shall be as lonely as an  Etruscan museum!  * (She breaks into a laugh.)*  That's what I've  paid for the right to keep your letters.  * (She holds out her  hand.)*  And now give me mine.  

VENTNOR.  Yours?  

MRS. DALE * (haughtily)*.  Yes; I claim them.  

VENTNOR * (in the same tone)*.  On what ground?    

MRS. DALE.  Hear the man!—Because I wrote them, of course.  

VENTNOR.  But it seems to me that—under your inspiration, I  admit—I also wrote mine.  

MRS. DALE.  Oh, I don't dispute their authenticity—it's yours  I deny!  

VENTNOR.  Mine?  

MRS. DALE.  You voluntarily ceased to be the man who wrote me  those letters—you've admitted as much.  You traded paper for flesh  and blood.  I don't dispute your wisdom—only you must hold to your  bargain!  The letters are * all* mine.  

VENTNOR * (groping between two tones)*.  Your arguments are  as convincing as ever.  * (He hazards a faint laugh.)*  You're a  marvellous dialectician—but, if we're going to settle the matter  in a spirit of arbitration treaty, why, there are accepted  conventions in such cases.  It's an odious way to put it, but since  you won't help me, one of them is—  

MRS. DALE.  One of them is—?  

VENTNOR.  That it is usual—that technically, I mean, the  letter—belongs to its writer—  

MRS. DALE * (after a pause)*.  Such letters as *  these?*  

VENTNOR.  Such letters especially—  

MRS. DALE.  But you couldn't have written them if I hadn't—  been willing to read them.  Surely there's more of myself in them  than of you.  

VENTNOR.  Surely there's nothing in which a man puts more of  himself than in his love-letters!  

MRS. DALE * (with emotion)*.  But a woman's love-letters are  like her child.  They belong to her more than to anybody else—  

VENTNOR.  And a man's?  

MRS. DALE * (with sudden violence)*.  Are all he risks!—   There, take them.  * (She flings the key of the cabinet at his  feet and sinks into a chair.)*  

VENTNOR * (starts as though to pick up the key; then  approaches and bends over her)*.  Helen—oh, Helen!  

MRS. DALE * (she yields her hands to him, murmuring:)* Paul!   * (Suddenly she straightens herself and draws back illuminated.)*   What a fool I am!  I see it all now.  You want them for your  memoirs!  

VENTNOR * (disconcerted)*.  Helen—  

MRS. DALE * (agitated)*.  Come, come—the rule is to unmask  when the signal's given!  You want them for your memoirs.  

VENTNOR * (with a forced laugh)*.  What makes you think so?  

MRS. DALE * (triumphantly)*.  Because * I* want them for mine!  

VENTNOR * (in a changed tone)*.  Ah—.  * (He moves away  from her and leans against the mantelpiece.  She remains seated,  with her eyes fixed on him.)*  

MRS. DALE.  I wonder I didn't see it sooner.  Your reasons  were lame enough.  

VENTNOR * (ironically)*.  Yours were masterly.  You're the  more accomplished actor of the two.  I was completely deceived.  

MRS. DALE.  Oh, I'm a novelist.  I can keep up that sort of  thing for five hundred pages!  

VENTNOR.  I congratulate you.  * (A pause.)*  

MRS. DALE * (moving to her seat behind the tea-table)*.  I've  never offered you any tea.  * (She bends over the kettle.)*  Why  don't you take your letters?  

VENTNOR.  Because you've been clever enough to make it  impossible for me.  * (He picks up the key and hands it to her.   Then abruptly)*—* Was* it all acting—just now?  

MRS. DALE.  By what right do you ask?  

VENTNOR.  By right of renouncing my claim to my letters.  Keep  them—and tell me.  

MRS. DALE.  I give you back your claim—and I refuse to tell  you.  

VENTNOR * (sadly)*.  Ah, Helen, if you deceived me, you  deceived yourself also.  

MRS. DALE.  What does it matter, now that we're both  undeceived?  I played a losing game, that's all.  

VENTNOR.  Why losing—since all the letters are yours?  

MRS. DALE.  The letters?  * (Slowly.)*  I'd forgotten the  letters—  

VENTNOR * (exultant)*.  Ah, I knew you'd end by telling me  the truth!  

MRS. DALE.  The truth?  Where * is* the truth?  * (Half to  herself.)*  I thought I was lying when I began—but the lies turned  into truth as I uttered them!  * (She looks at* VENTNOR.)  I *  did* want your letters for my memoirs—I * did* think I'd kept  them for that purpose—and I wanted to get   mine back for  the same reason—but now * (she puts out her hand and picks up  some of her letters, which are lying scattered on the table near  her)*—how fresh they seem, and how they take me back to the time  when we lived instead of writing about life!  

VENTNOR * (smiling)*.  The time when we didn't prepare our  impromptu effects beforehand and copyright our remarks about the  weather!  

MRS. DALE.  Or keep our epigrams in cold storage and our  adjectives under lock and key!  

VENTNOR.  When our emotions weren't worth ten cents a word,  and a signature wasn't an autograph.  Ah, Helen, after all, there's  nothing like the exhilaration of spending one's capital!  

MRS. DALE.  Of wasting it, you mean.  * (She points to the  letters.)*  Do you suppose we could have written a word of these if  we'd known we were putting our dreams out at interest?  * (She  sits musing, with her eyes on the fire, and he watches her in  silence.)*  Paul, do you remember the deserted garden we sometimes  used to walk in?  

VENTNOR.  The old garden with the high wall at the end of the  village street?  The garden with the ruined box-borders and the  broken-down arbor?  Why, I remember every weed in the paths and  every patch of moss on the walls!  

MRS. DALE.  Well—I went back there the other day.  The  village is immensely improved.  There's a new hotel with gas-fires,  and a trolley in the main street; and the garden has been turned  into a public park, where excursionists sit on cast-iron benches  admiring the statue of an Abolitionist.  

VENTNOR.  An Abolitionist—how appropriate!  

MRS. DALE.  And the man who sold the garden has made a fortune  that he doesn't know how to spend—  

VENTNOR * (rising impulsively)*.  Helen, * (he approaches  and lays his hand on her letters)*, let's sacrifice our fortune and  keep the excursionists out!  

MRS. DALE * (with a responsive movement)*.  Paul, do you  really mean it?  

VENTNOR * (gayly)*.  Mean it?  Why, I feel like a landed  proprietor already!  It's more than a garden—it's a park.  

MRS. DALE.  It's more than a park, it's a world—as long as we  keep it to ourselves!  

VENTNOR.  Ah, yes—even the pyramids look small when one sees  a Cook's tourist on top of them!  * (He takes the key from the  table, unlocks the cabinet and brings out his letters, which he  lays beside hers.)*  Shall we burn the key to our garden?  

MRS. DALE.  Ah, then it will indeed be boundless!  *  (Watching him while he throws the letters into the fire.)*  

VENTNOR * (turning back to her with a half-sad smile)*.  But  not too big for us to find each other in?  

MRS. DALE.  Since we shall be the only people there!  * (He  takes both her hands and they look at each other a moment in  silence.  Then he goes out by the door to the right.  As he reaches  the door she takes a step toward him, impulsively; then turning  back she leans against the chimney-piece, quietly watching the  letters burn.)*
