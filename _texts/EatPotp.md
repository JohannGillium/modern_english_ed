 		The Pot of Paint
 		By Onoto Watanna

      To a Portuguese great-grandfather the face of Moonshine  owed its peculiar beauty. Moonshine had heard of this  ancestor; a blot he was to her upon the proud Japanese  genealogy of her family, despite the fact that he had been  one of those remarkable Portuguese who brought to Japan the  first knowledge of Western science. When her Japanese  friends remarked that her eyes were yellow instead of black  and her hair waved barbarously, she would apologize very  humbly. But to the few foreigners whom she chanced to meet  in Nagasaki, Moonshine traded on her nationality in order to  win their favor.

       This fact, and of course her undoubted beauty, had been  her attraction for Dudley. He was an American of the usual  sort, seeing Japan through rose-colored glasses, marveling  that he was not indeed in another world altogether. Despite  the glamor of the land of poetry and flowers, however, never  for one moment did he lose his own Western point of view.  Nevertheless, he fell in love with Moonshine.

       Tomlinson, who was his intimate        friend and kinsman, had pleaded with him to give up the rash  notion of marrying Moonshine; or, if he must do so, to  follow the example of his countrymen and marry her only in  Japanese fashion. Dudley had answered with a stubborn pride  that would brook no criticism of the girl herself. She was  above reproach. For this reason, and because he honestly  loved her, he intended to marry and protect her with all the  homage he would have given to any woman who became his wife.

       Tomlinson had said: “She may be good and lovely and all  the rest, you know, old fellow, but you never can tell just  what to expect of these Orientals. The pagan must out in  them.” To which Dudley returned:

       “You forget that she is not entirely Japanese. She has  always had ideas alien to those among whom she has had to  live: she has always felt a stranger here. You will see,  Tomlinson, as my wife, she will absorb in time our Western  way of thinking and living, though I would not have her lose  her charm of Oriental birth.” He added with a little  confident laugh:

       “Really, Tomlinson, we'll make a bewitching little  Christian of her yet.”

       Tomlinson went to Helen Martin at the Hotel Imperial.

       “Try and do something to dissuade him from this,” he  said to the girl, who was strangely pale over the  intelligence. “He will ruin his whole career if he lets this  infatuation get the better of him.”

       “If Francis must marry her,” said Miss Martin very  gently, “we should be thankful that he will do so properly.”

       Meanwhile, Moonshine made some important purchases at  the chief European store in Nagasaki. In fact, she bought a  corset, a pair of little patent leather shoes, silken hose,  kid gloves, skirts, waists, and a bonnet.

       On the day of the wedding, she arrayed herself in all  this finery before the little beveled mirror in her room,  only large enough to reflect back her own exquisite face.  All the morning she had labored on her hair, painfully  endeavoring to dress it after some European mode which she  had seen in an old Parisian fashion plate. The result was a  trifle tousled, but nevertheless quite becoming.

       Then she put the corsets on, pulling them hard by the  strings, panting and breathing heavily with the exertion.

       “I cannot bear this corset long,” she said, sighing  hugely. She slipped a skirt on, then the waist, and somehow  or other she managed to fasten them correctly. Next she put  on the bonnet, then the gloves, several sizes too large for  her, and last of all, she sat down on the floor, drawing on  the little high-heeled Parisian shoes.

       When she was all quite dressed she slipped out of the  house just as she was, glancing about her fearfully lest she  might encounter some shocked relative. On the road the  little dogs sniffed and barked at her, missing the familiar  sound of her little wooden clogs. She reproved them gently:

       “Dear my honorable friends,” said she, “certainly you  are not acquainted with any American lady. Some day, maybe,  you will learn.”

       At the church, they were awaiting her—Dudley,  Tomlinson, Helen Martin and a fat missionary—whose deep,  solemn voice made her shiver.

       At first, when she came to the door of the church, they  did not recognize her in her changed attire, until she  announced in a queer little subtle voice, as she tried to  make graceful obeisance, despite the horrible corsets that  caused her agony:

       “Dear my augustnesses, I come!”

       Dudley started violently and paled all over. His lips  quivered fearfully as he went quickly down the aisle of the  little mission church to meet her.

       “God bless you!” he said brokenly to her. “It is[^n1] all  quite wrong—the clothes—but you did it for me!”

       After the first ejaculation of amazement at her changed  appearance, the two witnesses composed themselves, though  Tomlinson said in an audible whisper:

       “Good Lord! She has come all alone!”

       She replied to Dudley in a timid un-        der tone that had a tremor in it:

       “Pray excuse the honorable rudeness of my honorable  relatives. They doan like me mek marriage with barbarian.  But I also liddle bit like unto you, an' behold I jus'  runnin' away to you elope!”

       Dudley held her hand closely. She could not altogether  follow the marriage service, but she went through it  bravely, and repeated the beautiful words in a broken  accent, with far less nervousness than Dudley, who was  shaking like an aspen.

       After the ceremony, he took her straightway to his  hotel, whence he sent word to her honorable family, which  met in indignant counsel, solemnly and completely to disown  her forever.

       During the first month of his marriage, Dudley raved of  his unalloyed bliss to the cynical Tomlinson, who merely  thumped him hard on the back, wishing ardently that it might  continue. Aside he would say to Helen Martin:

       “What's the use? He can't see he's living in a fool's  paradise.”

       “Why?” Helen would demand somewhat impatiently, “she is  all and more than we could have hoped.”

       “Wait!” said Tomlinson, the raven, “I have lived long  in the East. The pagan must out!”

       Although he disapproved of his wife's habit of rising  with the sun, Dudley awoke one morning very early. The  glorious sunshine of Japan had forced its way in a golden  stream through the closed shutters into the room. At an open  shoji[^n2] he saw his wife almost before he was fully awake. She  was sitting, with her back to him, on the floor. Before her  was a little black lacquer box, its wide-open lid showing  the shining surface of inlaid mirror. Over it her head was  bending and her hands were very busy.

       Dudley got out of bed noiselessly, thinking to startle  her by coming on her of a sudden and catching her in his  arms. But as he came closer to her he became at first  interested, then mystified, and finally horrified at her  strange occupation. She was smearing big blotches of red  paint on her cheeks and lips. That done, she penciled her  eyebrows in the finest lines. Finally she began doing  something to her teeth.

       Watching her in almost a fascinated silence, Dudley  remained transfixed. When she had finished, the keenest eye  could hardly have detected the make-up, he thought, so  artfully had she laid it on.

       “Moonshine!” he called to her sharply.

       She started, truly, but from surprise rather than  guilt. She even sprang up joyfully, running to meet him,  with her small hands outstretched to his. He held her off.

       “I can't kiss you with that stuff on your face,” he  said sternly.

       Her long, yellow eyes grew large in bewilderment.

       “You kinnod kees me?” she said slowly. “Why, my lord?”

       “With that—that paint on your face! How can you ask?”       She smiled.

       He observed something else which alarmed him more than  before.

       “What have you done to your teeth?” he demanded.

       She parted her lips just a trifle. The little straight  row of pearly teeth was stained hideously in some brown dye.

       She essayed a little laugh of wonder and remonstrance.

       “O, dear my lord,” she said, “I nod any longer thad  liddle bit maiden. I nize married leddy now—”

       “Will that come off?”

       Dudley pointed with a shaking finger to her teeth.

       She nodded, her troubled eyes still seeking his for  explanation.

       “Take it off—and all the rest!” he shouted at her in  such a big thundering voice that she began to tremble.

       “You doan like me do—” she began.

       “Don't like!” he repeated. “Do you think I want my wife  to be a painted—”

       “You doan desire,” she began slowly, still past  understanding.

       Dudley began to have a conception of her viewpoint. To  this she had doubtless been educated and accus-        tomed all her life. He must effect the cure, gently but  firmly.

       “Moonshine, I ask you to take all that stain off your  teeth.”

       “Yeas—yeas,” she agreed, “I doan keer put thad on—no,  I doan keer thad I married leddy or nod; only all my  honorable ancestors—”

       “I know,” he said, “it is a custom of your race. But  you are married now to an American, remember. Women of my  country don't disfigure themselves in that way. Come—off  with it.” He led her to the wash-basin.

       She removed the stain from her teeth readily and  willingly enough, and she rubbed with a little sponge the  black lines above her eyes; but she stopped at taking off  the paint, begging and coaxing to be excused from such  humiliation. She could not bear to have him see her without  what seemed to her one of the chief perquisites of her  beauty.

       But he was inexorable, and stood over her peremptorily,  as with trembling hands and tearful eyes she rubbed her  cheeks.

       When she had quite finished, he held her at arm's  length and looked at her. He marveled that she should  attempt to spoil her natural delicate loveliness with such  hideous cosmetics.

       “Now,” said he, “I love you again. You must never  disfigure yourself in that way.”

       Delighted to discover that she was far prettier without  the make-up on her face, the depression her use of the  cosmetics caused him rapidly vanished. He even joked and  teased her about it as he dressed himself.

       She sat on the floor, leaning her head languidly  against the foot of the bed. Somehow, despite the chairs and  couches about their rooms, she seemed to slip naturally to  her little crouched up position on the floor, and her  husband could find no fault with this little pagan habit,  for she looked so quaint and pretty.

       As he talked, her eyes were downcast, and he noted with  pleasure how long and silky were the lashes that shadowed  them. She appeared to be all attention, listening to him  politely. Suddenly she put a question to him:

       “Dear my lord, you doan will condescend to kees me eef  I puttin' thad honorable paint on my insignificant, homely  countenance?”

       “I should say not,” said her husband with Western  decisiveness.

       “Eef,” said she, argumentatively, “you, my lord, an' me  your honorable insignificant wife go out on street togedder,  will you also kees me there whicheven?”

       “Of course not. American men don't do such things in  public, much as they may revel in it in private.”

       He was using the military brushes to his smooth brown  hair, smiling at her tenderly the while.

       “Then,” she said, “therefore I only puttin' thad  honorable paint on my honorable face wen I goin' out on  street. Then you 'scuse yourself to nod kees me, account  thad augustly unpoliteness for American gendleman. I doan  keer then. You kinnod do. Therefore I wear thad honorable  paint,” she explained triumphantly.

       “What!” said her husband, one hand pausing with a brush  halfway to his head. “You mean you'd put that paint on when  we go out?”

       “And take it off, my lord, wen you desire kees me,” she  finished for him.

       Dudley threw his brushes down on the bed and burst out  laughing. She was really irresistable, he thought. But, of  course, she must be converted. He sat down beside her on the  floor.

       “Listen, Mrs. Dudley,” said he, “you swore to honor and  obey me, did you not?”

       She inclined her head.

       “Then,” he continued. “I order you to destroy or throw  away every scrap of that make-up stuff. You'll do it?”

       “I will destroy all thad honorable beautiful stuff, my  lord,” she said.

       A few of his friends remarked that the bride's vivid  color had faded to a beautiful pink flush, to which Dudley  replied with a glance at his wife, that she could not be  said to lack color.

       “Of course, Mrs. Dudley isn't pale; but then she had  such a phenomenally gorgeous complexion before,” drawled  Tomlinson, with what seemed to the        truth-knowing Dudley, veiled meaning. However, he was  indifferent to comment. He knew that her appearance had  changed for the better, but he wondered that she should  still have so much color, for he remembered how on that  first day her skin had been peculiarly clear and creamy when  she had washed the paint off it, with scarcely a tinge of  color.

       A few days later, when she had dressed hurriedly to go  with him to an entertainment at the American Consulate, he  noticed a little red blotch on her nose.

       “What is that?” he inquired suspiciously, and he led  her before a long mirror.

       “Thad!” Her eyes flickered guiltily. “I jus' scratch my  honorable nose liddle bit,” she said.

       He took his handkerchief out and rubbed the spot,  despite her protests. Then he looked at the piece of linen  in his hand. It was stained in blurred red. Her honoroable  nose was free of its scratch.

       Without a word he led her back to their rooms. Holding  her face over a basin he washed it clean with a wet towel  end. After the flush resulting from his brisk motion had  died down, he found she was quite pale.

       “It is not,” he said, “so much the fact that you have  disobeyed me, but that you have deceived and lied to me.  Where is that paint box?”

       “I dinnod lie to you,” she denied with a burst of  passion, “I destroy thad same honorable box. I buy  altogedder new pot of paint, jus' nize liddle light paint  this-a-time.”

       “Get me it,” he ordered. He was quite angry this time,  and she dared not disobey him. The contents of the box he  emptied into the fireplace. Then he smashed the box.

       “I don't expect to find any more of that stuff around  these rooms; do you understand?”

       “Yeas, my lord,” she said, in such a small, humble  voice that his anger melted completely.

       He sat down and took her on his knee.

       “Little one, you will not use that stuff if I tell you  it pains me for you to do so, will you? Try and see things  as I do. Anything that is artificial is wrong, disgusting.  In America only women of a certain shunned type use paint,  or silly superficial women whose vanity is their sap of  life. I cannot bear to have my wife do so. Don't Moonshine,  don't.”

       She began to sob piteously.

       “Aeverybody goin' mek laugh ad me eef I doan did so.”

       “Nonsense; no, they won't,” he consoled her.

       “I loog so ole an' oogly this away.”

       “You look younger and prettier and fresher and sweeter  in every way,” he assured her eagerly.

       For a few days following, her manifest unhappiness  communicated itself to Dudley. His love made him quickly  conscious of and responsive to her moods. She had been of a  naturally exuberant and buoyant disposition; but now she  became quiet and passive, a shadow loitering constantly in  her troubled eyes. She went with him reluctantly, and often  would plead weariness or illness in order to be excused from  leaving her rooms.

       “Of course,” thought her husband patiently, “it is  natural for the poor little thing to feel badly about it at  first, but she will get used to it. She must.”

       Moonshine brooded over her unhappiness. Despite the  fact that she really loved the stranger she had married with  all the force of her passionate nature, nevertheless the  customs of her people were strongly implanted in her nature.  She could not feel at home among the people with whom she  now associated and who were almost altogether of her  husband's nationality. They were kindly and beautiful, she  admitted, but she resented their good-natured and humorous  encouragement of her efforts to dress and act like them.

       “Why,” she would argue inwardly, “should she continue  this struggle when all her efforts made her seem only the  more a stranger among them, a guest as it were? And why  should she be placed under this restraint and denied that  which a Japanese husband    would have purchased for her? It was all very hard and  bitter. She tortured herself with the thought that with the  loss of her pot of paint her beauty departed also. She could  not imagine Japanese feminine beauty without the lurking  presence of a magic toilet box. Of course her honorable  husband would continue to praise her face, but that was only  natural. He did not wish to pain her by letting her know the  truth. In this she judged him from a purely Japanese  standpoint. A Japanese husband, she knew, would continue to  assure his wife that she was beautiful, even long after she  had become an ancestor (grandmother).

       Then Moonshine conceived a plot by which she would put  her beauty to the test. Gowning herself in an exquisite dove-  colored kimono, tied about with a lavender obi, with a  little purple parasol shading her bare head, the hair of  which was dressed after the prevailing Japanese fashion, and  being careful to put no paint or powder whatever on her  face, she went down to that quarter of Nagasaki where she  had previously lived, hoping to encounter some of her old  friends, who would surely enlighten her as to the truth.

       She had excused herself from accompanying her husband  on a little business trip by wrapping her head up in wet  linen in the morning and pleading a violent headache.

       At first, when Moonshine left the hotel, her guilty  heart beat rapidly with the excitement and fear of her  proposed scheme. She felt like a naughty child running away  from home. But gradually, as the flying feet of her runner  put a great distance between her and the hotel the fear  vanished from her; she even forgot the fact that she had  come out in Japanese attire and with her face untouched by  any beauty save that of nature. A sense of delight possessed  her as they neared the old familiar quarter of the town  where she had spent nearly her entire life. She smiled with  delight over her stolen holiday.

       In a little street, gay with painted signboards and  posters and quaint goods displayed in front of shops,  Moonshine alighted from her jinrikisha[^n3], and bidding her man  not to lose sight of her, she started down the street,  stopping at several stores to make small purchases for  herself. She was bending over a silk merchant's counter,  examining the quality of a rich obi[^n4], when the titter of  familiar, silvery laughter caused her to look up.

       Two young Japanese girls were standing near her, their  little almond eyes sparking with fun over the tops of their  fans, and undisguisedly and openly laughing at the pale  Moonshine.

       The girl took a couple of little steps toward them,  opening her own little fan with a whirl.

       “Ah, good morning, Perfume and Spring,” she said in  soft Japanese. “Pray, is your honorable health good?”

       The girls giggled, but answered with seeming  politeness.

       “Good morning, Madame Moonshine. Yes, our honorable  health is good. And yours?”

       “Honorably excellent,” said Moonshine, with a piteous  look of entreaty as the two girls again lapsed into  tittering. “Why do you indulge in the honorable laugh, dear  my friends?” she inquired with unfeigned anxiety, for she  feared she had lost forever all her friends and earned their  ridicule by her marriage to the foreigner.

       “Oh, Moonshine—he-he-he-he,” said Perfume, “you do  look so honorably ridiculous.”

       Moonshine grew paler.

       “He-he-he—” giggled Spring. “Oh, Moonshine, has some  honorably wicked fiend or demon struck your august face?”

       “My face!” faltered Moonshine, unconsciously putting up  her little trembling hands to it, and then all in a moment  understanding. “Ah-h!” she breathed, “you think me—a little  bit ugly, maybe?”

       “Honorably hideous,” said Perfume, spitefully, and  Spring's laughter rang shrill.

       Moonshine looked at them a moment without speaking. One  of her packages fell from her hand to the    floor. She stooped and picked it up mechanically, placing it  in the sleeve of her kimono. Then she turned about slowly.  In a half-dazed fashion she held her hand up to her runner,  who had followed her obediently with the vehicle.

       The girls laughed vehemently now.

       “Ah bah! (good bye) honorable ghost!” they called after  her.

       That night when her husband returned, he found her  sitting in the dark waiting for him. A great wan moon had  stolen high in the heavens and one sheer, silvery beam came  into the open window and loitered upon the white face of his  wife. It was ghastly in its pallor, for she had been  suffering many hours.

       To his extreme horror, she crept on her knees to him,  and, putting her head at his feet, began a piteous  supplication for his honorable permission to purchase a  little pot of paint.

       He raised her to her feet, and drawing her into his  arms, tried to hush the sobs that had welled up from her  little overcharged heart.

       “Don't cry like that,” he said. “I can't bear it. You  are breaking my heart. Oh, why do you let such a foolish  trifle distress you and come between us?”

       “Pray, pray, my lord, allow me this liddle bit favor.”

       “Oh, this is quite foolish of you, Moonshine.”

       That night her sobbing slumber troubled him so he lay  awake. Then he made a blunder. He advised her to notice how  the American women of the finer class scorned the use of  such cosmetics. In particular he held up Miss Helen Martin  as a sample.

       He could not have said anything that would so quickly  have offended the supersensitive girl. She had acquired an  extraordinary aversion for the American girl, despite the  fact that Miss Martin had sought her out and tried in every  way to be kindly and friendly. Without the slightest cause,  Moonshine was positive that in Miss Martin she had a rival,  one who apparently could not conceal her feeling for Dudley,  and one whom she knew her husband absolutely admired and  respected.

       When Dudley had gone to the American Consulate for his  mail, as was his morning custom, Moonshine drew from a  hiding place her last remaining pot of paint. She thought of  the pale American girl with hatred, as she rubbed the paint  violently into her skin.

       Just at this time, Dudley was reading a letter from his  mother.

       “Bring her home to us, my son. Helen has told us so  much of her lovely personality, and I cannot tell you what  joy it gives us to know that at least she is a Christian.  Our grandchild must be born and christened here in America,  by all means.”

       He came back to Moonshine joyously. As she confronted  him at the threshold with her shining, defiant eyes and  painted cheeks, he staggered.

       “Why you doan marry thad Miss Helen Martin, my  honorable lord?” she queried.

       After that, recognizing the impossibility of taking her  to his mother, Dudley rented a little house in a suburb  close to the city, where he installed Moonshine. His love  had deepened to an all-absorbing tenderness and pity that  was touching. It was with the utmost patience that he  continued the struggle against the paint nightmare that had  now taken up its abode permanently with them, for despite  her spasmodic washings pure of her face, he knew that she  never was without it in the house.

       Autumn had crept upon the land with stealing step. A  melancholy sweetness pervaded hill and dale. The flowers  were turning to the hue of the golden brown leaves, which in  their turn reflected the colors of the dying sunset, when  Moonshine awakened in the night and piercingly called for  her mother. The old nurse that attended her refused to leave  her side, and Dudley started out in the night, shaken with a  great premonition of disaster and a vain hope to gratify the  wish of the sick girl to have her mother once more with her.

       On his way back, sick with the fruit-        lessness of his mission, for her people had been politely  obdurate, his Japanese valet, who had come to meet him,  flung himself at his feet, and after bitter tears and  lamentations told him of the death of his wife hardly an  hour after his departure, and of the birth of an honorable  man-child.

       Crazed and distracted with the horror of the tragedy  that had come upon him, Dudley rushed to the hotel where  they had previously lived, and where still abided a few of  his friends. There, like one bereft of all hope on earth, he  flung himself into Tomlinson's apartments. Tomlinson  promptly sent for Helen Martin. After vainly trying to  comfort the bereft man, they finally succeeded in prevailing  on him to return to the little house which had so lately  held his happiness.

       The place was dimly lighted by dull andons[^n5] and  horribly silent when they reached it. Their own footsteps  rang out hollow and ghostly as they crossed the zashishi[^n6]  and ascended the thin little stairway.

       Her nurse had dressed Moonshine in all the white  deathrobes of a Japanese girl. Trembling like one afflicted  with ague, the husband bent over her still form, great beads  of perspiration standing out on his own brow. Slowly, and  with shaking hand, he took the white cloth from Moonshine's  face.

       Miss Martin started back with an exclamation of horror.

       “Oh-h!” she said, “we must wash all that hideous paint  off. She must be buried as a Christian.”

       “No, no,” said Dudley, softly, “leave it on.”
