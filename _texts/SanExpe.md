# AN EXPERIENCE.
 BY MARGARET E. SANGSTER.

  - ONE came and told me suddenly,
 -    "Your friend is dead!  Last year she went;"
 -    But many years my friend had spent
 - In life's wide wastes, apart from me.
  - And lately I had felt her near,
 -    And walked as if by soft winds fanned,
 -    Had felt the touching of her hand,
 - Had known she held me close and dear.
  - And swift I learned that being dead
 -    Meant rather being free to live,
 -    And free to seek me, free to give,
 - And so my heart was comforted.
