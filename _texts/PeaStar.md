# "STAR I' THE DARKEST NIGHT."  

    - IF some sweet lady were to die in youth
  - And with her take a heaven of joy and truth,
  - Might not the Master dear of life and death,
  - Repenting of the act that quenched her breath,
  - Employ her loveliness and radiant grace
  - To fashion some swift star of further space?
  - So would she brightly shine in death's disdain
  - To comfort him who loved her to his pain—
  - His heart's sore pain.
      - Then, if he watched from cloud enshrouded heights,
  - All reverent, in still of limpid nights,
  - And if the eyes and soul of him were clear,
  - Perchance he would behold his lady dear—
  - Through driving cloud and specter mist and rain
  - And all obscurity, behold again
  - Her tender radiance!  Oh, God, through tears
  - Behold her beckoning him as in old years—
  - The unforgotten years!
    *Elia W. Peattie*.
