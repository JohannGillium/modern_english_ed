#   Wilkins, Mary E.  "A Gatherer of Simples." 
*Harper's New Monthly       Magazine* 69 (Oct. 1884): 787-793.

         A DAMP air was blowing up, and the frogs were beginning to peep.   The sun was setting in a low red sky.  On both sides of the road  were rich green meadows intersected by little canal-like brooks.   Beyond the meadows on the west was a distant stretch of pine woods,  that showed dark against the clear sky.  Aurelia Flower was going  along the road toward her home, with a great sheaf of leaves and  flowers in her arms.  There were the rosy spikes of hardhack; the  great white corymbs of thoroughwort, and the long blue racemes of  lobelia.  Then there were great bunches of the odorous tansy and  pennyroyal in with the rest.  

Aurelia was a tall, strongly built woman: she was not much  over thirty, but she looked older.  Her complexion had a hard red  tinge from exposure to sun and wind, and showed seams as  unreservedly as granite.  Her face was thin, and her cheek-bones  high.  She had a profusion of auburn hair, showing in a loose  slipping coil, beneath her limp black straw hat.  Her dress, as a  matter of fashion, was execrable; in point of harmony with her  immediate surroundings, very well, though she had not thought of it  in that way.  There was a green under-skirt, and a brown over-skirt  and basque of an obsolete cut.  She had worn it for a good many  years just so, and never thought of altering it.  It did not seem  to occur to her that though her name was Flower, she was not really  a flower in regard to apparel, and had not its right of  unchangeableness in the spring.  When the trees hung out their  catkins, she flaunted her poor old greens and browns under them,  rejoicing, and never dreamed but what they looked all right.  As  far as dress went, Aurelia was a happy woman.  She went along the  road to-night at a good pace, her armful of leaves and blossoms  nodding; her spare muscular limbs bore her along easily.  She had  been over a good many miles since noon, but she never thought of  being tired.  

Presently she came in sight of her home, a square unpainted  building, black with age.  It stood back a little from the road on  a gentle slope.  There were three great maple trees in front of the  house; their branches rustled against the roof.  On the left was a  small garden; some tall poles thickly twined with hops were  prominent in it.  

Aurelia went round to the side door of the house with her  armful of green things.  The door opened directly into the great  kitchen.  One on entering would have started back as one would on  seeing unexpected company in a room.  The walls were as green as a  lady's bower with bunches and festoons of all sorts of New    England herbs.  There they hung, their brave  blossoms turning gray and black, giving out strange half-pleasant,  half-disgusting odors.  Aurelia took them in like her native air.   "It's good to get home," murmured she to herself, for there was no  one else; she lived alone.  

She took off her hat and disposed of her burden; then she  got herself some supper.  She did not build a fire in the cooking  stove, for she never drank tea in warm weather.  Instead, she had  a tumbler of root-beer which she had made herself.  She set it out  on one end of her kitchen table with a slice of coarse bread and a  saucer of cold beans.  She sat down to it and ate with a good  appetite.  She looked better with her hat off.  Her forehead was an  important part of her face; it was white and womanly, and her  reddish hair lay round it in pretty curves; then her brown eyes,  under very strongly arched brows, showed to better advantage.   Taken by herself, and not compared with other women, Aurelia was  not so bad-looking; but she never was taken by herself in that way,  and nobody had ever given her any credit for comeliness.  It would  have been like looking at a jack-in-the-pulpit and losing all the  impression that had ever been made on one by roses and hyacinths,  and seeing absolutely nothing else but that one flower's fine green  and brown lines; it is doubtful if it would be done.  

She had finished her supper, and was sorting her fresh  herbs, when the door opened and a woman walked in.  She had no  bonnet on her head; she was a neighbor, and this was an  unceremonious little country place.  

"Good evenin', 'Relia," said she.  There was an important  look on her plain face, as if there was more to follow.  

"Good evenin', Mis' Atwood.  Take a chair."  

"Been herbin' again?"  

"Yes; I went out a little while this afternoon."  

"Where'd you go?—upon Green Mountain?"  

"No; I went over to White's Woods.  There were some kinds  there I wanted."  

"You don't say so!  That's a matter of six miles, ain't it?   Ain't you tired?"  

"Lor', no," said Aurelia.  "I reckon I'm pretty strong, or  mebbe the smell of the herbs keeps me up;" and she laughed.  

So did the other.  "Sure enough—well, mebbe it does.  I  never thought of that.  But it seems like a pretty long tramp to  me, though my bein' so fleshy may make a difference.  I could have  walked it easier once."  

"I shouldn't wonder if it did make a difference.  I ain't  got much flesh to carry round to tire me out."  

"You're always pretty well, too, ain't you, 'Relia?"  

"Lor', yes; I never knew what 'twas to be sick.  How's your  folks, Mis' Atwood?  Is Viny any better than she was?"  

"I don't know as she is, much.  She feels pretty poorly most  of the time.  I guess I'll hev you fix some more of that root-beer  for her.  I thought that seemed to liven her up a little."  

"I've got a jug of it all made, down-cellar, and you can  take it when you go home, if you want to."  

"So I will, if you've got it.  I was in hopes you might hev  it."  

The important look had not vanished from Mrs. Atwood's face,  but she was not the woman to tell important news in a hurry, and  have the gusto of it so soon over.  She was one of the natures who  always dispose of bread before pie.  Now she came to it, however.  

"I heard some news to-night, 'Relia," said she.  

Aurelia picked out another spray of hardhack.  "What was  it?" 

"Thomas Rankin's dead."  

Aurelia clutched the hardhack mechanically.  "You don't mean  it, Mis' Atwood!  When did he die?  I hadn't heard he was sick."  

"He wasn't, long.  Had a kind of a fit this noon, and died  right off.  The doctor—they sent for Dr. Smith from Alden—called  it sun-stroke.  You know 'twas awful hot, and he'd been out in the  field to work all the mornin'.  *I* think 'twas heart trouble;  it's in the Rankin family; his father died of it.  Doctors don't  know everything."  

"Well, it's a dreadful thing," said Aurelia.  "I can't  realize it.  There he's left four little children, and it ain't  more'n a year since Mis' Rankin died.  It *ain't* a year, is  it?" 

"It ain't a year into a month and sixteen days," said  Mrs. Atwood, solemnly.  "Viny and I was countin' of it up just  before I come in here."  

"Well, I guess 'tisn't, come to think of it.  I couldn't  have told exactly.  The   oldest of those  children ain't more than eight, is she?"  

"Ethelind is eight, coming next month; Viny and I was  reckinin' it up.  Then Edith is six, and Isadore is five, and  Myrtie ain't but two, poor little thing."  

"What do you s'pose will be done with 'em?"  

"I don't know.  Viny an' me was talking of it over, and got  it settled that *her* sister, Mis' Loomis, over to Alden,  would *hev* to hev 'em.  It'll be considerable for her, too,  for she's got two of her own, and I don't s'pose Sam Loomis has got  much.  But I don't see what else can be done.  Of course strangers  ain't goin' to take children when there is folks."  

"Wouldn't *his* mother take 'em?"  

"What, old-lady Sears?  Lor', no.  You know she was dreadful  put out 'bout Thomas marryin' where he did, and declared he  shouldn't hev a cent of her money.  It was all her second  husband's, anyway.  John Rankin wasn't worth anything.  She won't  do anything for 'em.  She's livin' in great style down near the  city, they say.  Got a nice house, and keeps help.  She might hev  'em just as well as not, but she won't.  She's a hard woman to get  along with, anyhow.  She nagged both her husbands to death, an'  Thomas never had no peace at home.  Guess that was one reason why  he was in such a hurry to get married.  Mis' Rankin was a good-tempered soul, if she wasn't quite so drivin' as some."  

"I do feel dreadfully to think of those children," said  Aurelia.  

"'Tis hard; but we must try an' believe it will be ruled for  the best.  I s'pose I must go, for I left Viny all alone."  

"Well, if you must, I'll get that root-beer for you, Mis'  Atwood.  I shall keep thinking 'bout those children all night."  

A week or two after that, Mrs. Atwood had some more news;  but she didn't go to Aurelia with it, for Aurelia was the very sub-essence of it herself.  She unfolded it gingerly to her daughter  Lavinia—a pale, peaked young woman, who looked as if it would take  more than Aurelia's root-beer to make her robust.  Aurelia had  taken the youngest Rankin child for her own, and Mrs. Atwood had  just heard of it.  

"It's true," said she; "I see her with it myself.  Old-lady  Sears never so much as sent a letter, let alone not coming to the  funeral, and Mis' Loomis was glad enough to get rid of it."  

Viny drank in the story as if it had been so much nourishing  jelly.  Her too narrow life was killing her as much as anything  else.  

Meanwhile Aurelia had the child, and was actively happy, for  the first time in her life, to her own *naive* astonishment,  for she had never known that she was not so before.  She had  naturally strong affections, of an outward rather than an inward  tendency.  She was capable of much enjoyment from pure living, but  she had never had anything to be so very fond of.  She could only  remember her father as a gloomy, hard-working man, who never  noticed her much.  He had a melancholy temperament, which resulted  in a tragical end when Aurelia was a mere child.  When she thought  of him, the same horror which she had when they brought him home  from the river crept over her now.  They had never known certainly  just how Martin Flower had come to die; but folks never spoke of  him to Aurelia and her mother, and the two never talked of him  together.  They knew that everybody said Martin Flower had drowned  himself; they felt shame and a Puritan shrinking from the sin.  

Aurelia's mother had been a hard, silent woman before; she  grew more hard and silent afterward.  She worked hard, and taught  Aurelia to.  Their work was peculiar; they hardly knew themselves  how they had happened to drift into it; it had seemed to creep in  with other work, till finally it usurped it altogether.  At first,  after her husband's death, Mrs. Flower had tried millinery; she had  learned the trade in her youth.  But she made no headway then in  sewing rose-buds and dainty bows on to bonnets; it did not suit  with tragedy.  The bonnets seemed infected with her own mood; the  bows lay flat with stern resolve, and the rose-buds stood up  fiercely; she did not please her customers, even among those  uncritical country folk, and they dropped off.  She had always made  excellent root-beer, and had had quite a reputation in the  neighborhood for it.  How it happened she could not tell, but she  found herself selling it; then she made hop yeast, and sold that.   Then she was a woman of a fertile brain, and another project  suggested itself to her.  

She and Aurelia ransacked the woods thereabouts for  medicinal herbs, and disposed of them to druggists in a neighboring  town.  They had a garden of some   sorts too—the  different mints, thyme, lavender, coriander, rosemary, and others.   It was an unusual business for two women to engage in, but it  increased, and they prospered according to their small ideas.  But  Mrs. Flower grew more and more bitter with success.  What regrets  and longing that her husband could have lived and shared it, and  been spared his final agony, she had in her heart, nobody but the  poor woman herself knew; she never spoke of them.  She died when  Aurelia was twenty, and a woman far beyond her years.  She mourned  for her mother, but although she never knew it, her warmest love  had not been called out.  It had been barely possible.  Mrs. Flower  had not been a lovable mother; she had rarely spoken to Aurelia but  with cold censure for the last few years.  People whispered that it  was a happy release for the poor girl when her mother died; they  had begun to think she was growing like her husband, and perhaps  was not "just right."  

Aurelia went on with the business with calm equanimity, and  made even profits every year.  They were small, but more than  enough for her to live on, and she paid the last dollar of the  mortgage which had so fretted her father, and owned the old house  clear.  She led a peaceful, innocent life, with her green herbs for  companions; she associated little with the people around, except in  a business way.  They came to see her, but she rarely entered their  houses.  Every room in her house was festooned with herbs; she knew  every kind that grew in the New England woods, and hunted them out  in their season and brought them home; she was a simple sweet soul,  with none of the morbid melancholy of her parents about her.  She  loved her work, and the green-wood things were to her as friends,  and the healing qualities of sarsaparilla and thoroughwort, and the  sweetness of thyme and lavender, seemed to have entered into her  nature, till she almost could talk with them in that way.  She had  never thought of being unhappy; but now she wondered at herself  over this child.  It was a darling of a child; as dainty and  winsome a girl baby as ever was.  Her poor young mother had had a  fondness for romantic names, which she had bestowed, as the only  heritage within her power, on all her children.  This one was  Myrtilla—Myrtie for short.  The little thing clung to Aurelia from  the first, and Aurelia found that she had another way of loving  besides the way in which she loved lavender and thoroughwort.  The  comfort she took with the child through the next winter was  unspeakable.  The herbs were banished from the south room, which  was turned into a nursery, and a warm carpet was put on the floor,  that the baby might not take cold.  She learned to cook for the  baby—her own diet had been chiefly vegetarian.  She became a  charming nursing mother.  People wondered. "It does beat all how  handy 'Relia is with that baby," Mrs. Atwood told Viny.  

Aurelia took even more comfort with the little thing when  spring came, and she could take her out with her; then she bought  a little straw carriage, and the two went after herbs together.   Home they would come in the tender spring twilight, the baby asleep  in her carriage, with a great sheaf of flowers beside her, and  Aurelia with another over her shoulder.  

She felt all through that summer as if she was too happy to  last.  Once she said so to one of the neighbors.  "I feel as if it  wa'n't right for me to be so perfectly happy," said she.  "I feel  some days as if I was walkin' an' walkin' an' walkin' through a  garden of sweet-smellin' herbs, an' nothin' else; an' as for  Myrtie, she's a bundle of myrtle an' camphor out of King Solomon's  garden.  I'm so afraid it can't last."  

Happiness had seemed to awake in Aurelia a taint of her  father's foreboding melancholy.  But she apparently had no reason  for it until early fall.  Then returning with Myrtie one night from  a trip to the woods, she found an old lady seated on her door-step,  grimly waiting for her.  She was an old woman and tremulous, but  still undaunted and unshaken as to her spirit.  Her tall, shrunken  form was loaded with silk and jet.  She stood up as Aurelia  approached wondering, and her dim old eyes peered at her  aggressively through fine gold spectacles, which lent an additional  glare to them.  

"I suppose you are Miss Flower?" began the old lady, with no  prefatory parley.  

"Yes," said Aurelia, trembling.  

"Well, my name's Mrs. Matthew Sears, an' I've come for my  grandchild there."  

Aurelia turned very white.  She let her herbs slide to the  ground.  "I—hardly understand—I guess," faltered she.  "Can't you  let me keep her?"    

"Well, I guess I won't have one of my grandchildren brought  up by an old yarb-woman—not if I know it!"  

The old lady sniffed.  Aurelia stood looking at her.  She  felt as if she had fallen down from heaven, and the hard reality of  the earth had jarred the voice out of her.  Then the old lady made  a step toward the carriage, and caught up Myrtie in her trembling  arms.  The child screamed with fright.  She had been asleep.  She  turned her little frightened face toward Aurelia, and held out her  arms, and cried, "Mamma! mamma! mamma!" in a perfect frenzy of  terror.  The old lady tried to hush her in vain.  Aurelia found her  voice then.  "You'd better let me take her and give her her  supper," she said, "and when she is asleep again I will bring her  over to you."  

"Well," said the old lady, doubtfully.  She was glad to get  the frantic little thing out of her arms, though.  

Aurelia held her close and hushed her, and she subsided into  occasional convulsive sobs, and furtive frightened glances at her  grandmother.  

"I s'pose you are stopping at the hotel," said Aurelia.  

"Yes, I am," said the old lady, stoutly.  "You kin bring her  over as soon as she's asleep."  Then she marched off with uncertain  majesty.  

Some women would have argued the case longer, but Aurelia  felt that there was simply no use in it.  The old lady was the  child's grandmother: if she wanted her, she saw no way but to give  her up.  She never thought of pleading, she was so convinced of the  old lady's determination.  

She carried Myrtie into the house, gave her her supper,  washed her, and dressed her in her little best dress.  Then she  took her up in her lap and tried to explain to her childish mind  the change that was to be made in her life.  She told her she was  going to live with her grandmother, and she must be a good little  girl, and love her, and do just as she told her to.  Myrtie sobbed  with unreasoning grief, and clung to Aurelia; but she wholly failed  to take the full meaning of it all in.  

She was still fretful and bewildered by her rude awakening  from her nap.  Presently she fell asleep again, and Aurelia laid  her down while she got together her little wardrobe.  There was a  hop pillow in a little linen case, which Myrtie had always slept  on; she packed that up with the other things.  

Then she rolled the little sleeping girl up in a blanket,  laid her in her carriage, and went over to the hotel.  It was not  much of a hotel—merely an ordinary two-story house, where two or  three spare rooms were ample accommodation for the few straggling  guests who came to this little rural place.  It was only a few  steps from Aurelia's house.  The old lady had the chamber of honor,  a large square room on the first floor, opening directly on to the  piazza.  In spite of all Aurelia's care, Myrtie woke up and began  to dry when she was carried in.  She had to go off and leave her  screaming piteously after her.  Out on the piazza, she uttered the  first complaint, almost, of her life, to the hostess, Mrs. Simonds,  who had followed her there.  

"Don't feel bad, 'Relia," said the woman, who was almost  crying herself.  "I know it's awful hard, when you was taking so  much comfort.  We all feel for you."  

Aurelia looked straight ahead.  She had the bundle of little  clothes and the hop pillow in her arms; the old lady had said, in  a way that would have been funny if it had not been for the poor  heart that listened, that she didn't want any yarb pillows, nor any  clothes scented with yarbs nuther.  

"I don't mean to be wicked," said Aurelia, "but I can't help  thinking that Providence ought to provide for women.  I wish Myrtie  was *mine*."  

The other woman wiped her eyes at the hungry way in which  she said "mine."  

"Well, I can't do anything; but I'm sorry for you, if that's  all.  You'd make enough sight better mother for Myrtie than that  cross old woman.  I don't b'lieve she more'n half wants her, only  she's *sot*.  She doesn't care anything about having the other  children; she's going to leave them with Mis' Loomis; but she says  her grandchildren ain't going to be living with strangers, an' she  ought to hev been consulted.  After all you've done for the child,  to treat you as she has to-night, she's the most ungrateful—  I  know one thing; I'd charge her for Myrtie's board—a good price,  too."  

"Oh, I don't want anything of that sort," said poor Aurelia  dejectedly, listening to her darling's sobs.  "You go in an' try to  hush her, Mis' Simonds.  Oh!"  

"So I will! her grandmother can't do    anything with her, poor little thing!  I've got some peppermints.   I do believe she's spankin' her—the—"  

Aurelia did not run in with Mrs. Simonds; she listened  outside till the pitiful cries hushed a little; then she went  desolately home.  

She sat down in the kitchen, with the little clothes in her  lap.  She did not think of going to bed; she did not cry of moan to  herself; she just sat there still.  It was not very late when she  came home—between eight and nine.  In about half an hour, perhaps,  she heard a sound outside that made her heart leap—a little voice,  crying pitifully, and saying, between the sobs, "Mamma! mamma!"  

Aurelia made one spring to the door.  There was the tiny  creature in her little night gown, shaking all over with cold and  sobs.  

Aurelia caught her up, and all her calm was over.  "Oh, you  darling! you darling! you darling!" she cried, covering her little  cold body all over with kisses.  "You sha'n't leave me—you  sha'n't'! you sha'n't!  Little sweetheart—all I've got in the  world.  I guess they sha'n't take you away when you don't want to  go.  Did you cry, and mamma go off and leave you?  Did they whip  you?  They never shall again—never! never!  There, there, blessed,  don't cry; mamma'll get you all warm, and you shall go to sleep on  your own little pillow.  Oh, you darling! darling! darling!"  

Aurelia busied herself about the child, rubbing the little  numb limbs, and getting some milk heated.  She never asked how she  came to get away; she never thought of anything except that she had  her.  She stopped every other minute to kiss her and croon to her;  she laughed and cried.  Now she gave way to her feelings; she was  almost beside herself.  She had the child all warm and fed and  comforted by the kitchen fire, when she heard steps outside, and  she knew at once what was coming, and a fierce resolve sprang up in  her heart: they should not have that child again to-night.  She  cast a hurried glance around; there was hardly a second's time.  In  the corner of the kitchen was a great heap of herbs which she had  taken down from the walls where they had been drying; the next day  she had intended to pack them and send them off.  She caught up  Myrtie and covered her with them.  "Lie still, darling!" she  whispered.  "Don't make a bit of noise, or your grandmother will  get you again."  Myrtie crouched under them, trembling.  

Then the door opened; Mr. Simonds stood there with a  lantern.  "That little girl's run away," he began—"slipped out  while the old lady was out of the room a minute.  Beats all how  such a little thing knew enough.  She's here, ain't she?"  

"No," said Aurelia, "she ain't."  

"You don't mean it?"  

"Yes."  

"Ain't you seen her, though?"  

"No."  

Mr. Simonds, who was fat and placid, began to look grave.   "Then, all there is about it, we've got to have a hunt," said he.   "'Twon't do to have that little tot out in her night-gown long.  We  hadn't a thought but that she was here.  Must have lost her way."  

Aurelia watched him stride down the yard.  Then she ran  after him.  "Mr. Simonds!"  He turned.  "I told you a lie.   Myrtie's in the corner of the kitchen under a heap of herbs."  

"Why, what on earth—"  

"I wanted to keep her so to-night."  Aurelia burst right out  in loud sobs.  

"There, 'Relia!  It's a confounded shame.  You shall keep  her.  I'll make it all right with the old lady somehow.  I reckon,  as long as the child's safe, she'll be glad to get rid of her to-night.  She wouldn't have slept much.  Go right into the house,  'Relia, and don't worry."  

Aurelia obeyed.  She hung over the little creature all  right, asleep in her little crib.  She watched her every breath.   She never thought of sleeping herself—her last night with Myrtie.   The seconds were so many grains of gold dust.  Her heart failed her  when day broke.  She washed and dressed Myrtie at the usual time,  and gave her her breakfast.  Then she sat down with her and waited.   The child's sorrow was soon forgotten, and she played about as  usual.  Aurelia watched her despairingly.  She began to wonder at  length why they did not come for her.  It grew later and later.   She would not carry her back herself, she was resolved on that.  

It was ten o'clock before any one came; then it was Mrs.  Simonds.  She had a strange look on her face.  

"'Relia," she said, standing in the door and looking at her  and Myrtie, "you 'ain't heard what's happened to our house this  morning', hev you?"    

"No," said Aurelia, awed.  

"Old Mis' Sears is dead.  Had her third shock: she's had two  in the last three years.  She was took soon after Mr. Simonds got  home.  We got a doctor right off, but she died 'bout an hour ago."  

"Oh," said Aurelia, "I've been a wicked woman."  

"No you ain't, Aurelia; don't you go to feeling so.  There's  no call for the living to be unjust to themselves because folks are  dead.  You did the best you could.  An' now you're glad you can  keep the child; you can't help it.  I thought of it myself the  first thing."  

"Oh, I was such a wicked woman to think of it myself," said  Aurelia.  "If I could only have done something for the poor old  soul!  Why didn't you call me?"  

"I told Mr. Simonds I wouldn't; you'd had enough."  

There was one thing, however, which Aurelia found to do—a  simple and touching thing, though it probably meant more to her  than to most of those who knew of it.  

On the day of the funeral the poor old woman's grave was  found lined with fragrant herbs from Aurelia's garden—thyme and  lavender and rosemary.  She had cried when she picked them, because  she could not help being glad, and they were all she could give for  atonement.
