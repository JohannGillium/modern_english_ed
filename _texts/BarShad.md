# SHADOWS

  -      A LITTLE trellis stood beside my head,
 -          And all the tiny fruitage of its vine
 -      Fashioned a shadowy cover to my bed,
 -          And I was madly drunk on shadow wine!
  -      A lily bell hung sidewise, leaning down,
 -          And gowned me in a robe so light and long;
 -      And so I dreamed, and drank, and slept, and heard
 -          The lily's song.
  -      Lo, for a house, the shadow of the moon;
 -          For golden money, all the daisy rings;
 -      And for my love, the meadow at my side â€”
 -          Thus tramps are kings!
                                   *Djuna Barnes*
