## I

                              I   YOU remember—it's not so long ago—the talk there was about  Dredge's "Arrival of the Fittest"?  The talk has subsided, but the  book of course remains: stands up, in fact, as the tallest thing of  its kind since—well, I'd almost said since "The Origin of  Species."  

I'm not wrong, at any rate, in calling it the most important  contribution yet made to the development of the Darwinian theory,  or rather to the solution of the awkward problem about which that  theory has had to make such a circuit.  Dredge's hypothesis will be  contested, may one day be disproved; but at least it has swept out  of the way all previous conjectures, including of course Lanfear's  magnificent attempt; and for our generation of scientific  investigators it will serve as the first safe bridge across a  murderous black whirlpool.  

It's all very interesting—there are few things more stirring  to the imagination than that sudden projection of the new  hypothesis, light as a cobweb and strong as steel, across the  intellectual abyss; but, for an idle observer of human motives, the  other, the personal, side of Dredge's case is even more interesting  and arresting.  

Personal side?  You didn't know there was one?  Pictured him  simply as a thinking machine, a highly specialized instrument of  precision, the result of a long series of "adaptations," as his own  jargon would put it?  Well, I don't wonder—if you've met him.  He  does give the impression of being something out of his own  laboratory: a delicate scientific instrument that reveals wonders  to the initiated, and is absolutely useless in an ordinary hand.  

In his youth it was just the other way.  I knew him twenty  years ago, as an awkward lout whom young Archie Lanfear had picked  up at college, and brought home for a visit.  I happened to be  staying at the Lanfears' when the boys arrived, and I shall never  forget Dredge's first appearance on the scene.  You know the  Lanfears always lived very simply.  That summer they had gone to  Buzzard's Bay, in order that Professor Lanfear might be near the  Biological Station at Wood's Holl, and they were picnicking in a  kind of sketchy bungalow without any attempt at elegance.  But  Galen Dredge couldn't have been more awe-struck if he'd been  suddenly plunged into a Fifth Avenue ball-room.  He nearly knocked  his shock head against the low doorway, and in dodging this peril  trod heavily on Mabel Lanfear's foot, and became hopelessly  entangled in her mother's draperies—though how he managed it I  never knew, for Mrs. Lanfear's dowdy muslins ran to no excess of  train.  

When the Professor himself came in it was ten times worse, and  I saw then that Dredge's emotion was a tribute to the great man's  proximity.  That made the boy interesting, and I began to watch.   Archie, always enthusiastic but vague, had said: "Oh, he's a  tremendous chap—you'll see—" but I hadn't expected to see quite  so clearly.  Lanfear's vision, of course, was sharper than mine;  and the next morning he had carried Dredge off to the Biological  Station.  And that was the way it began.  

Dredge is the son of a Baptist minister.  He comes from East  Lethe, New York State, and was working his way through college—  waiting at White Mountain hotels in summer—when Archie Lanfear ran  across him.  There were eight children in the family, and the  mother was an invalid.  Dredge never had a penny from his father  after he was fourteen; but his mother wanted him to be a scholar,  and "kept at him," as he put it, in the hope of his going back to  "teach school" at East Lethe.  He developed slowly, as the  scientific mind generally does, and was still adrift about    himself and his tendencies when Archie took him down to Buzzard's  Bay.  But he had read Lanfear's "Utility and Variation," and had  always been a patient and curious observer of nature.  And his  first meeting with Lanfear explained him to himself.  It didn't,  however, enable him to explain himself to others, and for a long  time he remained, to all but Lanfear, an object of incredulity and  conjecture.  

*" Why* my husband wants him about—" poor Mrs. Lanfear, the  kindest of women, privately lamented to her friends; for Dredge, at  that time—they kept him all summer at the bungalow—had one of the  most encumbering personalities you can imagine.  He was as  inexpressive as he is to-day, and yet oddly obtrusive: one of those  uncomfortable presences whose silence is an interruption.  

The poor Lanfears almost died of him that summer, and the pity  of it was that he never suspected it, but continued to lavish on  them a floundering devotion as uncomfortable as the endearments of  a dripping dog—all out of gratitude for the Professor's kindness!   He was full, in those days, of raw enthusiasms, which he forced on  any one who would listen when his first shyness had worn off.  You  can't picture him spouting sentimental poetry, can you?  Yet I've  seen him petrify a whole group of Mrs. Lanfear's callers by  suddenly discharging on them, in the strident drawl of Western New  York, "Barbara Frietchie" or "The Queen of the May."  His taste in  literature was uniformly bad, but very definite, and far more  assertive than his views on biological questions.  In his  scientific judgments he showed, even then, a remarkable temperance,  a precocious openness to the opposite view; but in literature he  was a furious propagandist, aggressive, disputatious, and extremely  sensitive to adverse opinion.  

Lanfear, of course, had been struck from the first by his gift  of accurate observation, and by the fact that his eagerness to  learn was offset by his reluctance to conclude.  I remember  Lanfear's telling me that he had never known a lad of Dredge's age  who gave such promise of uniting an aptitude for general ideas with  the plodding patience of the accumulator of facts.  Of course when  Lanfear talked like that of a young biologist his fate was sealed.   There could be no question of Dredge's going back to "teach school"  at East Lethe.  He must take a course in biology at Columbia, spend  his vacations at the Wood's Holl laboratory, and then, if possible,  go to Germany for a year or two.  

All this meant his virtual adoption by the Lanfears.  Most of  Lanfear's fortune went in helping young students to a start, and he  devoted his heaviest subsidies to Dredge.  

"Dredge will be my biggest dividend—you'll see!" he used to  say, in the chrysalis days when poor Galen was known to the world  of science only as a perpetual slouching presence in Mrs. Lanfear's  drawing-room.  And Dredge, it must be said, took his obligations  simply, with that kind of personal dignity, and quiet sense of his  own worth, which in such cases saves the beneficiary from  abjectness.  He seemed to trust himself as fully as Lanfear trusted  him.  

The comic part of it was that his only idea of making what is  known as "a return" was to devote himself to the Professor's  family.  When I hear pretty women lamenting that they can't coax  Professor Dredge out of his laboratory I remember Mabel Lanfear's  cry to me: "If Galen would only keep away!"  When Mabel fell on the  ice and broke her leg, Galen walked seven miles in a blizzard to  get a surgeon; but if he did her this service one day in the year,  he bored her by being in the way for the other three hundred and  sixty-four.  One would have imagined at that time that he thought  his perpetual presence the greatest gift he could bestow; for,  except on the occasion of his fetching the surgeon, I don't  remember his taking any other way of expressing his gratitude.  

In love with Mabel?  Not a bit!  But the queer thing was that  he * did* have a passion in those days—a blind, hopeless passion  for Mrs. Lanfear!  Yes: I know what I'm saying.  I mean Mrs.  Lanfear, the Professor's wife, poor Mrs. Lanfear, with her tight  hair and her loose figure, her blameless brow and earnest eye-glasses, and her perpetual attitude of mild misapprehension.  I can  see Dredge cowering, long and many-jointed, in a diminutive  drawing-room chair, one square-toed shoe coiled round an exposed  ankle, his knees clasped in a knot of red knuckles, and his  spectacles perpetually seeking Mrs. Lanfear's eye-glasses.  I never  knew if the poor lady was aware of the sentiment she inspired, but  her   children observed it, and it provoked them to  irreverent mirth.  Galen was the predestined butt of Mabel and  Archie; and secure in their mother's virtuous obtuseness, and in  her worshipper's timidity, they allowed themselves a latitude of  banter that sometimes turned their audience cold.  Dredge meanwhile  was going on obstinately with his work.  Now and then he had queer  fits of idleness, when he lapsed into a state of sulky inertia from  which even Lanfear's admonitions could not rouse him.  Once, just  before an examination, he suddenly went off to the Maine woods for  two weeks, came back, and failed to pass.  I don't know if his  benefactor ever lost hope; but at times his confidence must have  been sorely strained.  The queer part of it was that when Dredge  emerged from these eclipses he seemed keener and more active than  ever.  His slowly growing intelligence probably needed its  periodical pauses of assimilation; and Lanfear was marvellously  patient.  

At last Dredge finished his course and went to Germany; and  when he came back he was a new man—was, in fact, the Dredge we all  know.  He seemed to have shed his blundering, encumbering  personality, and come to life as a disembodied intelligence.  His  fidelity to the Lanfears was unchanged; but he showed it  negatively, by his discretions and abstentions.  I have an idea  that Mabel was less disposed to deride him, might even have been  induced to softer sentiments; but I doubt if Dredge even noticed  the change.  As for his ex-goddess, he seemed to regard her as a  motherly household divinity, the guardian genius of the darning  needle; but on Professor Lanfear he looked with a deepening  reverence.  If the rest of the family had diminished in his eyes,  its head had grown even greater.  

  
## II

   FROM that day Dredge's progress continued steadily.  If not  always perceptible to the untrained eye, in Lanfear's sight it  never deviated, and the great man began to associate Dredge with  his work, and to lean on him more and more.  Lanfear's health was  already failing, and in my confidential talks with him I saw how he  counted on Galen Dredge to continue and amplify his doctrine.  If  he did not describe the young man as his predestined Huxley, it was  because any such comparison between himself and his great  predecessors would have been repugnant to his taste; but he  evidently felt that it would be Dredge's role to reveal him to  posterity.  And the young man seemed at that time to take the same  view of his calling.  When he was not busy about Lanfear's work he  was recording their conversations with the diligence of a  biographer and the accuracy of a naturalist.  Any attempt to  question or minimize Lanfear's theories roused in his disciple the  only flashes of wrath I have ever seen a scientific discussion  provoke in him.  In defending his master he became almost as  intemperate as in the early period of his literary passions.  

Such filial dedication must have been all the more precious to  Lanfear because, about that time, it became evident that Archie  would never carry on his father's work.  He had begun brilliantly,  you may remember, by a little paper on * Limulus Polyphemus* that  attracted a good deal of notice when it appeared in the * Central  Blatt*; but gradually his zoological ardour yielded to an absorbing  passion for the violin, which was followed by a sudden plunge into  physics.  At present, after a side-glance at the drama, I  understand he's devoting what is left of his father's money to  archaeological explorations in Asia Minor.  

"Archie's got a delightful little mind," Lanfear used to say  to me, rather wistfully, "but it's just a highly polished surface  held up to the show as it passes.  Dredge's mind takes in only a  bit at a time, but the bit stays, and other bits are joined to it,  in a hard mosaic of fact, of which imagination weaves the pattern.   I saw just how it would be years ago, when my boy used to take my  meaning in a flash, and answer me with clever objections, while  Galen disappeared into one of his fathomless silences, and then  came to the surface like a dripping retriever, a long way beyond  Archie's objections, and with an answer to them in his mouth."  

It was about this time that the crowning satisfaction of  Lanfear's career came to him: I mean, of course, John Weyman's gift  to Columbia of the Lanfear Laboratory, and the founding, in  connection with it, of a chair of Experimental Evolution.  Weyman  had always taken an interest in Lanfear's work, but no one had  supposed   that his interest would express itself so  magnificently.  The honour came to Lanfear at a time when he was  fighting an accumulation of troubles: failing health, the money  difficulties resulting from his irrepressible generosity, his  disappointment about Archie's career, and perhaps also the  persistent attacks of the new school of German zoologists.  

"If I hadn't Galen I should feel the game was up," he said to  me once, in a fit of half-real, half-mocking despondency.  "But  he'll do what I haven't time to do myself, and what my boy can't do  for me."  

That meant that he would answer the critics, and triumphantly  affirm Lanfear's theory, which had been rudely shaken, but not  displaced.  

"A scientific hypothesis lasts till there's something else to  put in its place.  People who want to get across a river will use  the old bridge till the new one's built.  And I don't see any one  who's particularly anxious, in this case, to take a contract for  the new one," Lanfear ended; and I remember answering with a laugh:  "Not while Horatius Dredge holds the other."  

It was generally known that Lanfear had not long to live, and  the Laboratory was hardly opened before the question of his  successor in the chair of Experimental Evolution began to be a  matter of public discussion.  It was conceded that whoever followed  him ought to be a man of achieved reputation, some one carrying, as  the French say, a considerable "baggage."  At the same time, even  Lanfear's critics felt that he should be succeeded by a man who  held his views and would continue his teaching.  This was not in  itself a difficulty, for German criticism had so far been mainly  negative, and there were plenty of good men who, while they  questioned the permanent validity of Lanfear's conclusions, were  yet ready to accept them for their provisional usefulness.  And  then there was the added inducement of the Laboratory!  The  Columbia Professor of Experimental Evolution has at his disposal  the most complete instrument of biological research that modern  ingenuity has yet produced; and it's not only in theology or  politics * que Paris vaut bien une messe!*  There was no trouble  about finding a candidate; but the whole thing turned on Lanfear's  decision, since it was tacitly understood that, by Weyman's wish,  he was to select his successor.  And what a cry there was when he  selected Galen Dredge!  

Not in the scientific world, though.  The specialists were  beginning to know about Dredge.  His remarkable paper on Sexual  Dimorphism had been translated into several languages, and a  furious polemic had broken out over it.  When a young fellow can  get the big men fighting over him his future is pretty well  assured.  But Dredge was only thirty-four, and some people seemed  to feel that there was a kind of deflected nepotism in Lanfear's  choice.  

"If he could choose Dredge he might as well have chosen his  own son," I've heard it said; and the irony was that Archie—will  you believe it?—actually thought so himself!  But Lanfear had  Weyman behind him, and when the end came the Faculty at once  appointed Galen Dredge to the chair of Experimental Evolution.  

For the first two years things went quietly, along accustomed  lines.  Dredge simply continued the course which Lanfear's death  had interrupted.  He lectured well even then, with a persuasive  simplicity surprising in the slow, inarticulate creature one knew  him for.  But haven't you noticed that certain personalities reveal  themselves only in the more impersonal relations of life?  It's as  if they woke only to collective contacts, and the single  consciousness were an unmeaning fragment to them.  

If there was anything to criticize in that first part of the  course, it was the avoidance of general ideas, of those brilliant  rockets of conjecture that Lanfear's students were used to seeing  him fling across the darkness.  I remember once saying this to  Archie, who, having recovered from his absurd disappointment, had  returned to his old allegiance to Dredge.  

"Oh, that's Galen all over.  He doesn't want to jump into the  ring till he has a big swishing knock-down argument in his fist.   He'll wait twenty years if he has to.  That's his strength: he's  never afraid to wait."  

I thought this shrewd of Archie, as well as generous; and I  saw the wisdom of Dredge's course.  As Lanfear himself had said,  his theory was safe enough till somebody found a more attractive  one; and before that day Dredge would probably have accumulated  sufficient proof to crystallize the fluid hypothesis.   

       
## III

   THE third winter I was off collecting in Central America, and  didn't get back till Dredge's course had been going for a couple of  months.  The very day I turned up in town Archie Lanfear descended  on me with a summons from his mother.  I was wanted at once at a  family council.  

I found the Lanfear ladies in a state of incoherent distress,  which Archie's own indignation hardly made more intelligible.  But  gradually I put together their fragmentary charges, and learned  that Dredge's lectures were turning into an organized assault on  his master's doctrine.  

"It amounts to just this," Archie said, controlling his women  with the masterful gesture of the weak man.  "Galen has simply  turned round and betrayed my father."  

"Just for a handful of silver he left us," Mabel sobbed in  parenthesis, while Mrs. Lanfear tearfully cited Hamlet.  

Archie silenced them again.  "The ugly part of it is that he  must have had this up his sleeve for years.  He must have known  when he was asked to succeed my father what use he meant to make of  his opportunity.  What he's doing isn't the result of a hasty  conclusion: it means years of work and preparation."  

Archie broke off to explain himself.  He had returned from  Europe the week before, and had learned on arriving that Dredge's  lectures were stirring the world of science as nothing had stirred  it since Lanfear's "Utility and Variation."  And the incredible  outrage was that they owed their sensational effect to the fact of  being an attempted refutation of Lanfear's great work.  

I own that I was staggered: the case looked ugly, as Archie  said.  And there was a veil of reticence, of secrecy, about Dredge,  that always kept his conduct in a half-light of uncertainty.  Of  some men one would have said off-hand: "It's impossible!"  But one  couldn't affirm it of him.  

Archie hadn't seen him as yet; and Mrs. Lanfear had sent for  me because she wished me to be present at the interview between the  two men.  The Lanfear ladies had a touching belief in Archie's  violence: they thought him as terrible as a natural force.  My own  idea was that if there were any broken bones they wouldn't be  Dredge's; but I was too curious as to the outcome not to be glad to  offer my services as moderator.  

First, however, I wanted to hear one of the lectures; and I  went the next afternoon.  The hall was jammed, and I saw, as soon  as Dredge appeared, what increased security and ease the interest  of his public had given him.  He had been clear the year before,  now he was also eloquent.  The lecture was a remarkable effort:  you'll find the gist of it in Chapter VII of "The Arrival of the  Fittest."  Archie sat at my side in a white rage; he was too clever  not to measure the extent of the disaster.  And I was almost as  indignant as he when we went to see Dredge the next day.  

I saw at a glance that the latter suspected nothing; and it  was characteristic of him that he began by questioning me about my  finds, and only afterward turned to reproach Archie for having been  back a week without notifying him.  

"You know I'm up to my neck in this job.  Why in the world  didn't you hunt me up before this?"  

The question was exasperating, and I could understand Archie's  stammer of wrath.  

"Hunt you up?  Hunt you up?  What the deuce are you made of,  to ask me such a question instead of wondering why I'm here now?"  

Dredge bent his slow calm scrutiny on his friend's quivering  face; then he turned to me.  

"What's the matter?" he said simply.  

"The matter?" shrieked Archie, his clenched fist hovering  excitedly above the desk by which he stood; but Dredge, with  unwonted quickness, caught the fist as it descended.  

"Careful—I've got a * Kallima* in that jar there."  He  pushed a chair forward, and added quietly: "Sit down."  

Archie, ignoring the gesture, towered pale and avenging in his  place; and Dredge, after a moment, took the chair himself.  

"The matter?" Archie reiterated with rising passion.  "Are you  so lost to all sense of decency and honour that you can put that  question in good faith?  Don't you really * know* what's the  matter?"  

Dredge smiled slowly.  "There are so few things one * really  knows*."  

"Oh, damn your scientific hair-splitting!  Don't you know  you're insulting my father's memory?"    

Dredge stared again, turning his spectacles thoughtfully from  one of us to the other.  

"Oh, that's it, is it?  Then you'd better sit down.  If you  don't see at once it'll take some time to make you."  

Archie burst into an ironic laugh.  

"I rather think it will!" he conceded.  

"Sit down, Archie," I said, setting the example; and he  obeyed, with a gesture that made his consent a protest.  

Dredge seemed to notice nothing beyond the fact that his  visitors were seated.  He reached for his pipe, and filled it with  the care which the habit of delicate manipulations gave to all the  motions of his long, knotty hands.  

"It's about the lectures?" he said.  

Archie's answer was a deep scornful breath.  

"You've only been back a week, so you've only heard one, I  suppose?"  

"It was not necessary to hear even that one.  You must know  the talk they're making.  If notoriety is what you're after—"  

"Well, I'm not sorry to make a noise," said Dredge, putting a  match to his pipe.  

Archie bounded in his chair.  "There's no easier way of doing  it than to attack a man who can't answer you!"  

Dredge raised a sobering hand.  "Hold on.  Perhaps you and I  don't mean the same thing.  Tell me first what's in your mind."  

The request steadied Archie, who turned on Dredge a  countenance really eloquent with filial indignation.  

"It's an odd question for you to ask; it makes me wonder  what's in yours.  Not much thought of my father, at any rate, or  you couldn't stand in his place and use the chance he's given you  to push yourself at his expense."  

Dredge received this in silence, puffing slowly at his pipe.  

"Is that the way it strikes you?" he asked at length.  

"God!  It's the way it would strike most men."  

He turned to me.  "You too?"  

"I can see how Archie feels," I said.  

"That I'm attacking his father's memory to glorify myself?"  

"Well, not precisely: I think what he really feels is that, if  your convictions didn't permit you to continue his father's  teaching, you might perhaps have done better to sever your  connection with the Lanfear lectureship."  

"Then you and he regard the Lanfear lectureship as having been  founded to perpetuate a dogma, not to try and get at the truth?"  

"Certainly not," Archie broke in.  "But there's a question of  taste, of delicacy, involved in the case that can't be decided on  abstract principles.  We know as well as you that my father meant  the laboratory and the lectureship to serve the ends of science, at  whatever cost to his own special convictions; what we feel—and you  don't seem to—is that you're the last man to put them to that use;  and I don't want to remind you why."  

A slight redness rose through Dredge's sallow skin.  "You  needn't," he said.  "It's because he pulled me out of my hole, woke  me up, made me, shoved me off from the shore.  Because he saved me  ten or twenty years of muddled effort, and put me where I am at an  age when my best working years are still ahead of me.  Every one  knows that's what your father did for me, but I'm the only person  who knows the time and trouble that it took."  

It was well said, and I glanced quickly at Archie, who was  never closed to generous emotions.  

"Well, then—?" he said, flushing also.  

"Well, then," Dredge continued, his voice deepening and losing  its nasal edge, "I had to pay him back, didn't I?"  

The sudden drop flung Archie back on his prepared attitude of  irony.  "It would be the natural inference—with most men."  

"Just so.  And I'm not so very different.  I knew your father  wanted a successor—some one who'd try and tie up the loose ends.   And I took the lectureship with that object."  

"And you're using it to tear the whole fabric to pieces!"  

Dredge paused to re-light his pipe.  "Looks that way," he  conceded.  "This year anyhow."  

*" This year*—?" Archie gasped at him.  

"Yes.  When I took up the job I saw it just as your father  left it.  Or rather, I didn't see any other way of going on with  it.  The change came gradually, as I worked."  

"Gradually?  So that you had time to look round you, to know  where you were, to see you were fatally committed to undoing the  work he had done?"    

"Oh, yes—I had time," Dredge conceded.  

"And yet you kept the chair and went on with the course?"  

Dredge refilled his pipe, and then turned in his seat so that  he looked squarely at Archie.  

"What would your father have done in my place?" he asked.  

"In your place—?"  

"Yes: supposing he'd found out the things I've found out in  the last year or two.  You'll see what they are, and how much they  count, if you'll run over the report of the lectures.  If your  father'd been alive he might have come across the same facts just  as easily."  

There was a silence which Archie at last broke by saying: "But  he didn't, and you did.  There's the difference."  

"The difference?  What difference?  Would your father have  suppressed the facts if he'd found them?  It's * you* who insult  his memory by implying it!  And if I'd brought them to him, would  he have used his hold over me to get me to suppress them?"  

"Certainly not.  But can't you see it's his death that makes  the difference?  He's not here to defend his case."  

Dredge laughed, but not unkindly.  "My dear Archie, your  father wasn't one of the kind who bother to defend their case.  Men  like him are the masters, not the servants, of their theories.   They respect an idea only as long as it's of use to them; when it's  usefulness ends they chuck it out.  And that's what your father  would have done."  

Archie reddened.  "Don't you assume a good deal in taking it  for granted that he would have had to in this particular case?"  

Dredge reflected.  Yes: I was going too far.  Each of us can  only answer for himself.  But to my mind your father's theory is  refuted."  

"And you don't hesitate to be the man to do it?"  

"Should I have been of any use if I had?  And did your father  ever ask anything of me but to be of as much use as I could?"  

It was Archie's turn to reflect.  "No.  That was what he  always wanted, of course."  

"That's the way I've always felt.  The first day he took me  away from East Lethe I knew the debt I was piling up against him,  and I never had any doubt as to how I'd pay it, or how he'd want it  paid.  He didn't pick me out and train me for any object but to  carry on the light.  Do you suppose he'd have wanted me to snuff it  out because it happened to light up a fact he didn't fancy?  I'm  using * his* oil to feed my torch with: yes, but it isn't really  his torch or mine, or his oil or mine: they belong to each of us  till we drop and hand them on."  

Archie turned a sobered glance on him.  "I see your point.   But if the job had to be done I don't see that you need have done  it from his chair."  

"There's where we differ.  If I did it at all I had to do it  in the best way, and with all the authority his backing gave me.   If I owe your father anything, I owe him that.  It would have made  him sick to see the job badly done.  And don't you see that the way  to honour him, and show what he's done for science, was to spare no  advantage in my attack on him—that I'm proving the strength of his  position by the desperateness of my assault?"  Dredge paused and  squared his lounging shoulders.  "After all," he added, "he's not  down yet, and if I leave him standing I guess it'll be some time  before anybody else cares to tackle him."  

There was a silence between the two men; then Dredge continued  in a lighter tone:  "There's one thing, though, that we're both in  danger of forgetting: and that is how little, in the long run, it  all counts either way."  He smiled a little at Archie's outraged  gesture.  "The most we can any of us do—even by such a magnificent  effort as your father's—is to turn the great marching army a  hair's breadth nearer what seems to us the right direction; if one  of us drops out, here and there, the loss of headway's hardly  perceptible.  And that's what I'm coming to now."  

He rose from his seat, and walked across to the hearth; then,  cautiously resting his shoulder-blades against the mantel-shelf  jammed with miscellaneous specimens, he bent his musing spectacles  on Archie.  

"Your father would have understood why I've done, what I'm  doing; but that's no reason why the rest of you should.  And I  rather think it's the rest of you who've suffered most from me.
