# THE GIPSY'S BEAR — A STORY

 [^]:  A new Russian author of note has recently been brought to the attention of English readers.  His name is W. M. Garshin and, according to a British reviewer, "in quality of vision and vigor of interpretation he seems fully Tolstoy's equal."  Unfortunately the output of his pen consists, so far as known, of only about twenty published stories and sketches, and we need not look for any additions.  Garshin inherited an unstable nervous system and in a fit of melancholia ended his life more than twenty years ago at the age of thirty-three.  His stories, of which the following is one, have but lately been translated into English and published in England under the title "The Signal and Other Stories." 

    IN the steppe the town of Bielsk nestles on the river Rokhla.  In September of 1857 the town was in a state of unwonted excitement.  The Government's order for the killing of the bears was to be executed.  The unhappy gipsies had journeyed to Bielsk from four districts with all their household effects, their horses and their bears.  More than a hundred of these awkward beasts, ranging from tiny cubs to huge "old men" whose coats had become whitish-gray with age, had collected on the town common.  The gipsies had been given five years' grace from the publication of the order prohibiting performing bears, and this period had expired.  They were now to appear at specified places and themselves destroy their supporters. 

They had completed their last round through the villages with the familiar goat and big drum — the invariable companions of the bears. For the last time, having espied them afar off coming down from the steppe, a little crowd of boys and girls had run a verst to meet them, returning triumphantly with them, a confused rabble, back to the village, where the fun of the fair had already commenced. 

And what fun it was!  What festivities took place!  The bears had displayed their histrionic talents, had danced, wrestled, showed how little boys steal the peas, imitated the mincing step of a young girl and the waddling gait of an old woman.  For the last time they had received their reward in the form of a tumbler of vodka, which the bear, standing on its hind-legs, would seize with both front-paws, place against his shaggy muzzle, and, throwing his head back, empty down his throat, after which he would lick his jaws and express his satisfaction in a quiet rumble and strange deep sighs. 

For the last time old men and women had come to the gipsies to be cured of their ailments by the true and tried process of lying on the ground under a bear, which would place his belly on the patient, spread himself out on all fours, and remain in this position until the gipsies considered the seance had lasted long enough.  For the last time they had gone to the huts, when, if the bear voluntarily entered, he was led into the front portion of the dwelling, and all sat there and rejoiced at his graciousness as a good omen; but if, in spite of all entreaties and caresses, he refused to cross the threshold, the occupants would be sorrowful, and neighbors would shake their heads. 

 
 The day broke cloudy and wet — a genuine September day — with an occasional slight drizzle; but, notwithstanding this, numbers of both sexes and of all ages went to the common to see the interesting spectacle.  The town was almost deserted.  All the vehicles the town boasted were engaged in taking out the curious.  They left them at the encampment, and returned for fresh loads.  By ten o'clock all were there. 

The gipsies had lost all hope.  There was not much noise in the camp.  The women were hiding in the tents with the little ones, so as not to see the massacre, and only occasionally a despairing wail was wrung from one or another of them.  The men were feverishly making the last preparations.  They had dragged the wagons to the edge of the camping-ground, and had tied the bears to them. 

The ispravnik of Bielsk passed along the rows of condemned.  The bears themselves were not altogether calm.  The unusual surroundings, the strange preparations, the enormous crowd, the large number of bears collected together — all this had excited them, and they tugged or gnawed at their chains, uttering occasional low growls.  Old Ivan stood near his enormous bear, crooked with rage.  His son, an elderly gipsy whose black hair was already streaked with silvery-gray, and his grandson, with ghastly faces and burning eyes, were hastily tying up the bear. 

The ispravnik came up level with the trio.        

"Well, old man," said he, "tell them to commence." 

"A wave of excited expectation passed over the crowd of onlookers, conversation redoubled, and soon after all became quiet, and amidst a profound silence was heard a low but authoritative voice.  Old Ivan was speaking. 

"Allow me, sir, to speak."  Then, turning to his fellow-gipsies, he continued: "Comrades, I beg of you to let me be the first to finish.  I am older than any of you.  Next year I shall have seen ninety years.  I have led bears from my infancy, and in the whole camp there is no bear older than mine." 

He lowered his gray, curly head on to his chest, shaking it sorrowfully from side to side, and wiped his eyes with his fist.  Then he drew himself up, raised his head, and continued in a louder, firmer voice than before: 

"Therefore I want to be the first.  I thought I should not live to see such grief.  I thought that my bear, my loved one, would outlive me; but apparently Fate has willed otherwise.  With my own hand I must kill him, my provider and benefactor.  Loose him; let him be free.  He will not go away; he, like us old men, will not flee from death.  Loose him, Vasia!  I do not wish to kill him bound, as they kill cattle.  Do not be afraid," said he, turning to the crowd, which showed signs of alarm; "he will not move." 

The youth freed the huge beast and led him a short distance away from the wagon.  The bear sat on his haunches, letting his front paws hang loosely, and swayed from side to side, breathing heavily and hoarsely.  He was very old, his teeth were yellow, his coat had grown a reddish color and was falling out.  He gazed in a friendly but melancholy manner at his old master with his one small eye.  All around was an absolute silence, broken only by the noise of the ramrods against the barrels of the rifles as the wads were pressed home. 

"Give me the gun," said the old man firmly. 

His son gave him the rifle.  He took it, and, pressing the muzzle against the old animal's breast, again began to address the bear: 

"I am going to kill thee in a minute, Porap.  God grant that my old hand may not tremble, and that the bullet may find its way into thy very heart.  I do not want to torture thee.  Thou dost not deserve that, my old bear, my good, my kind old mate.  I caught thee a little cub.  One of thy eyes had gone, thy nose was rotting from the ring, thou wert suffering from consumption.  I tended thee as a son, and pitied thee, and thou grewest up a big and powerful bear.  There is not such another in all the camps that have collected here.  And thou grewest up and didst not forget my kindness.  Never have I had such a friend amongst men such as thou hast been.  Thou hast been kind and quiet and clever, and hast learnt all.  Never have I seen a beast kinder, more clever than thou. What would I have been without thee?  My whole family have lived by thy labor.  Thou hast brought me two sledges.  It was thou who didst build me a hut for the winter.  Thou hast done yet more for me.  Thou didst save my son from being a soldier.  Ours is a large family, but all, from the oldest to the youngest, thou hast supported up till now.  And I have loved thee greatly, and have not beaten thee too much, and if I have in any offended against thee, forgive me.  At thy feet I bow." 

He threw himself at the bear's feet.  The beast quietly and plaintively growled.  The old man lay on the ground, his whole body quivering, convulsed with sobs. 

"Shoot, daddy," said his son.  "Do not tear our hearts!" 

Ivan rose.  The tears no longer flowed.  He threw back the gray mane which had fallen over his brow, and continued in a steady, resounding voice: 

"And now I must kill thee.  They have ordered me, an old man, to shoot thee with my own hands.  Thou must no longer live on this earth. Why?  May God in Heaven judge us!" 

He cocked the rifle, and with a firm, steady hand aimed at the beast's heart under the left paw.  And the bear understood.  A pitiful, heart-rending sound broke from the bear.  He stood upon his hind-legs, and raised his fore-paws as if to hide his face with them from the terrifying gun.  A wail went up from the gipsies; in the crowd many were openly crying.  With a sob the old man threw aside the rifle, and fell senseless to the ground.  His son rushed forward to pick him up, and the grandson seized the gun. 

"It must be," he cried in a wild hysterical voice, with blazing eyes. "Enough!  Shoot, comrades; let us end it!"  And, running up to the beast, he placed the muzzle of the rifle against the bear's ear and fired.  The bear fell to the ground a lifeless mass.  Only his paws moved convulsively, and his paw* dropped as if yawning.  Throughout the encampment rang out shots and the despairing cries of women and children.  A light breeze carried the smoke towards the river.
