#    THE FEATHER MANTLE
   (*Hagoromo*: a woman play)   

         This play begins on a perfect spring day: sweeping blue sky, mild air,   pines along the beach, and sunlit sea. The world we know appeared, they   say, when sky and earth split apart; now, though, heaven and earth seem   still conjoined at ease, one lightly-breathing vastness. As on such a day   the earthbound heart rises of itself into free space, so an angel, too,   may, as in *The Feather Mantle*, descend.   

         No one knows for certain who wrote *The Feather Mantle*, or   when, but it makes a fine introduction to the whole nō repertoire.   Many of the marks of a god play can be found in it, and one of these is   thanks given for our Sovereign's reign. This thanks is rendered for all   harmony and delight, to the Lord who shall reign for ever and ever; whose   reign endures, indeed, even through the trials enacted in the plays that   follow. (If his reign did not so endure, then return to communion and   illumination would hardly be possible.) This Sovereign is not only secular   and historical; he is also the focal point and power center of the world.   

         It is the angel's warm, feminine charm that puts *The Feather   Mantle* in the class of woman plays, for true god plays avoid such   coloring. This very charm, though, makes *The Feather Mantle*   more perfectly representative, for love is the heart of Japanese   poetry—especially if to love between man and woman, one joins love   for the fleeting graces of nature herself.   

         And who indeed is this charming celestial maiden? She proves to be the   laurel tree that grows in the moon, and the very moon itself,                 giver of every gift. Her garment is less a human mantle than sky, mist,   and cloud. The flowers in her hair are doubtless actually growing in the   green spring hills. She really does have all of nature's fleeting graces,   of which the moon is the sign, and might well move one to love.   

       In nō, mention of the full moon is likely to be coupled, as   here, with the Buddhist term True Semblance    (*shinnyo*). True Semblance can loosely be said to mean   Reality, but this reality is no absolute to be grasped at and held. True   Semblance can be owned or defined no more than the angel's loveliness.   

         As the moon, the angel invokes her own 'true ground,' the Bodhisattva   Seishi. This is because Shinto deities, the natural powers of the world,   were widely held to be local manifestations of the universal Buddhas and   Bodhisattvas. Such a local manifestation is the projected image, and the   name of this mode of understanding is *honji   suijaku*, true ground and projected image. Seishi stands to the   right of the Buddha Amida, Lord of Infinite Light, and is Amida's   all-illuminating wisdom. Thus the angel, with all her graces, is actually   wisdom manifest.   

         Versions of the story of *The Feather Mantle* are to be found   all over the world. The pattern is that a band of celestial maidens (in   ancient Japanese accounts the number is eight) come down to earth to enjoy   some particularly wholesome pleasure, such as bathing in a spring or   drinking fresh milk. There, a man surprises them. All escape back to   heaven but the last one, who is detained by the man and often has to marry   him. Much later, though, she does fly home again, and the man, who by some   failing has let her escape, can never follow.   

                   What the angel does during her visit to earth is to transmit certain music   called the Suruga Dance from East Country Pleasures. East Country   Pleasures is *Azuma-asobi*, a body of songs and dances from   the region far to the east of Miyako, the capital. There is a tradition   that an angel did indeed give the Suruga Dance to mankind on a beach in   the province of Suruga. From the standpoint of nō, however, one   might imagine that it is music itself that she teaches, and that the whole   repertoire is an unfolding of this music.   

                     
# *ISSEI*

              *   A small pine stands down front. Caught in its branches is a length of   cloth that represents the mantle. Sideman and two Sideman's Seconds enter,   carrying fishing poles; they stand down front, to one side of the pine.   When all three sing together, they are face to face; when Sideman speaks   alone, he faces front.   *          ISSEI

      Sideman and Side Second:        -  Swift winds blow 
 - by Mio
 - down the curving shore
 - small craft row
 - and fishermen
 - call o'er the sea lanes!
               NANORI

     Sideman:       I'm a fisherman known on the pine barrens of Mio as Hakuryō.   

             SASHI

      Sideman and Side Second:       - Boundless leagues of lovely hills, and clouds suddenly rise; one lone   tower's bright moon marks first the rain's clearing.' Yes, a time it   is 
    - of mild calm!
     - Spring again has touched
     - pine barrens
     - wave on lingering wave 
    - the morning mists, 
    - moon loitering in sky meadows 
    - endless
     - the gaze roves on: 
    - a scene to quiet, 
    - to absorb the heart! 
               SAGEUTA

         - I'll not forget
     - how mountain trails
     - we took to Clearview Cove, 
    - and spied afar 
    - Mio's pine barrens:
     - come now, friends,
     - there's where we'll go 
    - come now, friends,
     - there's where we'll go!
                AGEUTA

        - Wind-billowed, 
    - the clouds float high
     - waves then to you 
 - the clouds float high
     - waves then to you 
    - are they, men, 
    - no fishing done, 
    - will you hurry home? 
    - Wait! It's spring a while, 
    - and mild blows the morning breeze, 
    - yes, the pines' song everlasting, 
    - waves are silent 
    - in the morning calm 
    - and fishermen crowd forth 
    - in teeming craft 
    - fishermen crowd forth 
    - in teeming craft!  
                    *   Sideman's Seconds sit slightly upstage of Sideman's spot. Sideman lays   down his pole at stagehand stop, takes fan in hand, and comes out to main   spot.   *          *

         Sideman:       I've just come up to the pine barrens of Mio, and I'm gazing at the view   of the shore, when from the void blossoms fall, music resounds, and   wondrous fragrances pervade all space. This can hardly be common. And in   fact I see here, hung on this pine tree, a beautiful mantle. A closer look   now: color and scent are marvelous indeed. This is no ordinary mantle.   I'll take it home with me to show my friends, and to keep as an heirloom   in my house.   

         *   Carrying the mantle in both hands, he starts toward Sideman's spot. But   Doer calls to him as she comes through curtain, and starts down bridgeway.   She wears the *zō-onna* mask and an   angel's glittering crown.   *          MONDO

       Doer:       I'm sorry, but that mantle's mine! Why have you taken it?   

         *   Sideman is now at Sideman's spot.)   *         Sideman:       I just happen to have run across it, so I'm taking it home with me.   

             Doer:       But it's an angel's feather mantle! It isn't supposed to be given to a   human being! Do please leave it where it was!   

             Sideman:       As I understand it, then, this is an angel's mantle. Why, in that case,   it's obviously a wonder in these latter days, and I ought to have it as a   treasure for the whole land! I'm not going to give it back.   

             Doer:       Oh no! Without the feather mantle, flying is over for me; I'll never be   able to return to Heaven! Please, please give it back!   

                       Sideman:       - Hakuryō 
    - will not heed 
    - this gracious plea,
     - but grows stubborn: 
    - heartless I've always been, 
    - I, a fisherman.
     - The celestial 
    - feather mantle 
    - he hides from her.  
       *   He turns front, away from Doer, who is by now at main spot.   *         - No indeed, says he, 
    - and turns to go.  
              Doer:       - In her plight now
     - the angel, 
    - like a wingless bird, 
              Sideman:       - moving to rise,
   - has no mantle; 
               Doer:       - on earth, is caught 
   - in the nether world. 
               Sideman:       - Either way, alas! . . .
 - she laments,  
              Doer:       - but as Hakuryō 
    - will keep the mantle,  
              Sideman:       helpless,   

             Doer:       hopeless   

             AGEUTA

          Chorus:       - tears run, 
    - shining jewel headdress, 
    - flowers in her hair
     - droop and wilt: 
    - the five signs 
    - of an angel's fall 
    - are here
     - before my very eyes— 
    - oh pitiful!  
          *   She gazes up to her right into the sky.   *          SHIMO-NO-EI

          Doer:       - To the fields of Heaven 
    - backward I gaze, 
    - but mists rise, 
    - cloudways blur, 
    - the path is lost!' 
               SAGEUTA

          Chorus:       - My home so dear, 
    - the sky, oh when
     - shall I pass yonder move 
    - the clouds
     - and enviously 
    - I look on! 
               AGEUTA

             - The kalavinka's
     - voice I loved
     - the kalavinka's 
 - voice I loved
     - to hear, now fades
     - and wild geese cry 
    - down the skyways,
     - going home—
   - and oh, this   
              - longing!
     - Plovers, gulls, 
    - with waves offshore come and go
     - breezes of spring
     - blowing through the sky, they too
     - quicken yearning 
    - blowing through the sky, they too
     - quicken yearning! 
           *   She gazes up at sky, and weeps.   *          MONDO

          Sideman:       I can see now you're suffering terribly. I'll give you back your mantle.   

             Doer:       Oh, I'm so happy! Then do bring it to me!   

         *   She presses toward Sideman.   *          Sideman:       A moment, though.   

      *   He retreats an equal distance.   *         I'll return your mantle if you'll be kind enough to do right here and now   the angel dance I've heard tell of.   

             Doer:       I'm so happy! Yes, I *will* get home to Heaven!   And for joy I'll indeed dance, right here and now. You shall pass my dance   on to the downcast folk of your world. But I can't do anything without my   mantle. Please give it back to me first.   

             Sideman:       Oh no, if I return your mantle you won't dance, you'll head straight up to   Heaven.   

             Doer:       No, suspicion's for the human realm; in Heaven there's no falsehood.   

             Sideman:       I'm so ashamed! Why then, says he, by all means; and gives her back the   mantle.   

         *   Side gives mantle to Doer, then goes to sit at Sideman's spot.   *          MONO-GI-ASHIRAI

      *   Doer withdraws to stagehand spot, where she puts on the mantle. She then   comes out to main spot.   *          KAKEAI

                    Doer:       - The maiden,
     - in mantle clothed, 
    - does Rainbow Skirts and Cloak of Wings;  
              Sideman:       - the celestial 
    - feather mantle 
    - moves to the winds, 
               Doer:       - moist with rain 
    - the blossom sleeves, 
               Sideman:       as music plays   

             Doer:       and she dances on!   

             SHIDAI

          Chorus:       - The Suruga Dance 
    - from East Country Pleasures 
    - the Suruga Dance
     - from East Country Pleasures: 
    - Sparely, this 
    - is how it began! 
               KURI

             - Now, to speak of 
    - the long-faring sky:
     - ages past, in the Twin Gods' time, 
    - when they laid out the world 
    - in each one 
    - of its ten directions, 
    - the sky had no end, 
    - and that it why 
    - they dubbed it 
    - long-faring. 
               SASHI

          Doer:       - As for the Palace 
    - of the Moon,
     - with glittering ax 
    - hewn for all eternity:  
              Chorus:       - robed in white or black 
    - the angel throng 
    - made two bands, 
    - each of thrice five, 
    - and all moon long, 
    - night by night,
     - a celestial maid
     - with task assigned
     - carries out her role.  
              Doer:       - Of these I am one: 
    - celestial maiden  
              Chorus:       - of the moon
     - laurel tree, 
    - I've split in two, 
    - to visit 
    - and myself pass on 
    - to your world here 
    - the Suruga Dance 
    - of the East Country! 
               KUSE

             - Mists of spring
     - trail on long-faring 
    - moon laurel flowers bloom! 
    - Yes, crown of blossoms
     - in full hue 
    - surely means spring! 
    - Oh lovely! 
    - Though no Heaven, 
    - here too we've sweet grace.
     - Winds of the skies,
                  - blow shut the clouds'
     - passageways! 
    - The maiden lingers, 
    - pine barrens'
     - spring hues to see 
    - on Mio Cape,
     - and the moon so 
    - Clearview Cove, 
 - snows of Fuji— 
    - which excels? 
    - Peerless this spring dawn,  
   - the waves,
     - the pining wind 
    - so mild, 
    - the tranquil shore! 
    - Sky and earth, why, what parts them? 
    - Zoned with light
     - are Inner Shrine and Outer, 
    - whose gods' offspring 
    - rule here still; 
    - the very moon's
     - spotlessly clear 
    - our sunrise land, Japan!  
              Doer:       - In this our Sovereign's reign 
    - celestial 
    - feather mantles
     - seldom descend: 
               Chorus:       - caressed, the rock
     - yet wears not away, 
    - oh happy news! 
    - Songs of the East:
     - with voices join 
    - in sweet concert 
    - drone-pipes, flutes,
     - harps and zitherns 
    - swelling out past the Lone Cloud; 
    - red sinks the sun, 
    - so mirroring Mount Sumeru; 
    - green in the waves 
    - Float Isle Moor
     - gale-swept, 
    - where blossoms fall, 
    - yes, whirling snow 
    - the white cloud sleeves 
    - are lovely indeed! 
           *   Pausing in her dance movements, Doer sits at main spot and joins palms in   reverence.   *          EI

         Doer:       Hail to thee, Seishi, oh thou True Ground of the Moon, daughter of Heaven!   

             Chorus:       - A dance, then, 
   - from the East Country Pleasures.  
              JO-NO-MAI

      *   Doer rises and, between these two passages of text, dances a  *jo-no-mai* dance. She goes on dancing, however, as text   resumes.   *          NORIJI

         Doer:       - Now, the mantle blue 
  - that's Heaven's lofty sky,  
              Chorus:       - now, the mantling mist 
  - that rises in spring,  
              Doer:       - hue and fragrance
     - both delight! 
    - The maiden's train  
                       Chorus:       - sweeps and sways, 
    - all rustling, 
    - flowers nod in her hair; 
    - celestial 
    - feather sleeves 
    - billow, coil and turn, 
    - the dancing sleeves!  
              HA-NO-MAI

      *   Between these two passages, she dances a  *ha-no-mai* dance. Again, she continues dancing as text   resumes.   *          NORIJI

            - As on and on
     - the dances go
     - as on and on 
    - the dances go,
     - she who's named moon
     - palace lady 
    - high in the dark sky
     - this thrice fifth night
     - becomes again
     - face of True Semblance, 
    - the full moon, and rains riches: 
    - prayers fulfilled, 
    - the realm replete, 
    - the seven treasures 
    - overflowing,
     - these on our land bestows;
     - and so time runs, 
    - the celestial
     - feather mantle
     - wind-borne billows 
    - down the shore; 
    - pine barrens of Mio,
     - Float Isle's clouds, 
    - Mount Ashitaka, yes,
     - and Fuji's 
    - towering peak
     - fade out, 
    - mist-veiled 
    - into high Heaven
     - she is lost from view.
