# The NEW SECRET SERVICE of the UNITED STATES

   SEVERAL months ago a great railway bridge which spanned one of the  boundary rivers between the United States and Canada was seriously  damaged by the explosion of a huge charge of dynamite.  

Not many hours later a roughly dressed man was found in the  woods on the American side and arrested on suspicion.  Under  examination be confessed.  Yes, he had blown up the bridge.  He  was willing to admit it.  He was a most engagingly frank person,  this dynamiter who had tried to put an international railway trunk  line out of business, and had been perfectly willing to wreck  trains and kill scores of people in doing it.  

The story of this crime, of the over-willing confession of the  perpetrator, and of the subsequent procedure by which the Secret  Service men learned the facts that finally enabled them to send  the criminal to prison gives a particularly graphic illustration  of the difficulties with which the service has to grapple.  

The prisoner declared that he was a reserve officer of the  German army, and insisted that he had committed, on Canadian soil,  an act of war against Canada, in the interest of his own country.   He denied that he had committed any crime whatever, and  particularly denied that he had in any way offended against the  peace, dignity, or laws of the United States.  On his theory, he  was merely a soldier who had been making war against the British  Empire, and had escaped to American territory.  Being captured  there, he was entitled to be regarded, not as a common criminal,  but as a soldier subject to internment by the neutral government  of the United States.  

The Canadian railways, he argued, were carrying both war  supplies and soldiers from the interior to the Atlantic seaboard,  and anything that would hinder their operation, and perhaps  destroy some of these necessaries of war, would be a service to  Germany.  

He had concluded, therefore, to conduct a one-man invasion of  Canada and, if possible, to blow up a railroad bridge where it  would do the most damage to the country's transportation system.   He said that he had no particular difficulty in getting into  Canada.  He left the train at the first station on the Canadian  side and walked back along the track toward the international  boundary.  It had been arranged in advance, according to his tale,  that between the railway-station and the bridge-head he would meet  an Irishman carrying a suitcase.  As they approached each other he  was to address the Irishman:  

"Hello, Tommy!"  

"Hello yourself," Tommy was to reply.  

Thereupon Tommy was to turn over the suit-case to the  reservist and disappear into the woods.  In the suit-case was  eighty-five pounds of dynamite, with fuses and other necessary  paraphernalia for exploding it.  

All this, according to the "confession" of the dynamiter, took  place precisely as had been arranged.  He received the bag of  explosives and infernal mechanism from Tommy, walked out on the  bridge, placed   the dynamite, and set the fuse, being  careful to keep on the Canadian side of the boundary-line.  Then,  he said, he went on across the bridge to the American side, and  disappeared into the forest, having planned to walk to a village  several miles away, where he thought he could appear without  exciting suspicion and escape on a train.  

It was a particularly well-organized and attractive story.   The Secret Service men were not satisfied with it, but through  many hours of questioning and cross-questioning they failed to  lead the prisoner into any substantial modification of his  narrative.  What they wanted was to prove that he had committed an  offense against the laws of the United States.  

The most palpable flaw in his story was its introduction of  the mysterious Tommy.  This particular yarn was of a type with  which the Secret Service people were thoroughly familiar; and they  early concluded that Tommy was a fiction introduced in order to  account for the dynamiter's possession of the explosives.  They  believed that he had, in fact, brought the suit-case full of  dynamite with him from the United States; and if this were true  there was a chance to prosecute him for the statutory crime of  transporting explosives on a train carrying passengers.  

Having made up their minds that this was the correct theory,  the officers set about to find evidence supporting it.  They were  helped by the fact that the prisoner had made a curious mistake in  framing his plans.  When arrested he was arrayed in the costume of  a working man.  A description of the costume and of the prisoner  was furnished to the railroad authorities of every line that might  have brought him from New York.  Conductors, porters, ticket-agents,  and employees generally were questioned as to whether they  had seen the man, when he had ridden on any of the trains, and  what baggage he carried.  

This drag-net very quickly brought the desired information.   The man had left New York carrying a heavy suit-case, and had  traveled by way of Boston in one of the best trains of the New  Haven Railroad.  On that train, because his rough clothing was  incongruous with his mode of travel, he had been noted and  remarked upon by both officials and fellow passengers.  

With this information in their possession, the officers were  still unable to complete their case against him, because, while  they were morally certain that he had carried the explosives with  him from New York, nobody had actually seen the inside of his  suit-case.  The prisoner still clung to the story of the  mysterious Tommy, and it was very doubtful whether a jury could be  induced to convict him in the face of his own seemingly frank and  circumstantial narrative; so a ruse was resorted to for the  purpose of breaking down his story and getting a real confession  instead of a bogus one.  

This part of the story illustrates how the skilled operators  of the Secret Service work to get information from unwilling  witnesses.  The officials do not attempt any "third degree" method  of forcing confessions.  It has been found too frequently that  statements thus extorted are likely to be worthless.  Instead, the  effort is made to discover some sentimental trait in the  prisoner's character, through which he can be led, in spite of  himself, to tell the truth.  

During their repeated conversations with the dynamiter the  investigators had discovered that be was particularly proud of his  status as a German army officer.  He had referred more than once  to the honor of his profession, and had strenuously insisted that  he had acted as a soldier, not as a criminal.  

Accordingly, one of the detectives sat down with him and took  his dictation of the confession on which he stood.  It was written  out with the utmost care, and he was permitted to correct and sign  it.  

Then came the appeal which broke down the entire fabrication.   Having signed the statement, the prisoner handed it across the  table to the Secret Service man who had helped prepare it.  The  latter picked it up, hesitated a few moments, and then, producing  a fountain pen, wrote, immediately following the prisoner's  signature:    

I certify that the foregoing is a true and complete statement,  on my honor as a gentleman and an officer of the German army.    

With this addendum, the memorandum was passed back to the  prisoner,  

"Now," said the investigator, "just accommodate me by signing  that, and this part of our business will be finished."  

The prisoner picked up the memorandum and eyed it with some  curiosity.  He read the addendum.  Then he turned back to the  beginning of the statement and perused  it with a new care and  interest.  He turned it over in his hands several times, and read  it once more.  Finally he laid it down on the table, smiled grimly  at his *vis-a-vis*, and slowly shook his head.  

The Secret Service man took out his watch, glanced at it a  little impatiently, as if the delay was annoying, and said:  

"Well?"  

"I guess I can't sign that," admitted the prisoner  lugubriously.  

"What's the matter with it?  You've already signed it once."  

The prisoner shook his head again, this time more decisively.  

"No, I can't sign that."  

"But why not?" persisted the investigator.  

"Tommy!"  

Nothing more was said for a full minute, the two men watching  each other closely.  Then the official spoke:  

"You don't care to declare, on your honor as a gentleman and  an officer of the German army, that there was any Tommy in the  case?"  

The prisoner burst into a hearty laugh.  

"Well," he said, "anyhow, I've got those Canadians up there  still looking for Tommy!  No, there wasn't any Tommy."  

The government had perfected its case.  On the trial it was  proved that the dynamiter had calmly walked through the Grand  Central Station in New York carrying nearly one hundred pounds of  dynamite in his bag, bought his railroad ticket, climbed into a  Pullman car, chucked his bagful of destruction under a lower  berth, and himself scrambled into the upper berth.  

The prisoner testified, with some evidences of gleeful  satisfaction, that he enjoyed an excellent night's sleep.  Perhaps  the man in the lower berth would not have done so well if he had  known all about his traveling companion; his testimony is not at  hand.  

This little story has been told because it illustrates the  methods employed by the Secret Service.  The good, old-fashioned,  dime-novel methods of heroic sleuths who are pictured carrying  young arsenals on their persons and doing lightning-change acts  with wigs and false mustaches, are not being affected now in the  best circles of Secret Service society.  An old-school detective  of the *Nick Carter* type would be about as useful and appropriate  in the organization of the present Secret Service as a forty-two-centimeter gun at a peace parliament.  They aren't doing it that  way nowadays.  

It is perhaps not generally known that there are now two  distinct branches of the United States Secret Service.  The older  branch has been in existence for many years, and is a division of  the Treasury Department, commissioned to prevent counterfeiting  and to investigate one or two other classes of offenses, such as  fraudulent bounty claims.  Prior to 1908 this was the only  detective agency of the government.  The Department of justice,  though charged with the prosecution of criminal cases, had no  means of investigation save inquiries by district attorneys and  Federal grand juries.  

On request of a district attorney, it was customary for the  Secret Service to loan operatives to the Department of justice to  make a particular investigation.  In cases involving violation of  the national banking laws, the department would borrow the  services of national bank examiners, who were experts in banking  and accounting methods, to help secure evidence of illegal acts.   But in general there was no organized bureau or service designed  for general use in detecting violations of Federal laws.  

Early in 1908 the charge was made in Congress that Secret  Service operatives had been employed to inquire into the conduct  of members of Congress.  This caused much indignation, and, as a  result, there was inserted in one of the appropriation bills of  that year a proviso that thereafter the Secret Service of the  Treasury Department should be employed only for enforcement of the  laws against counterfeiting and for the protection of the  President, and in no other way whatever; also that no Secret  Service officer should be paid from any other than the regular  Secret Service appropriation.  This meant that the other  government departments were not to be permitted thereafter to  borrow investigators from the Treasury.  

These restrictions on the established Secret Service made it  necessary for the Department of justice to equip itself with some  sort of investigating instrumentality of its own, which could be  used to secure evidence in land-fraud, revenue, peonage, and other  classes of cases.  At that time the department had a corps of  attorney examiners, as they were called, and this  corps was  expanded into the Bureau of Investigation of the Department of  justice, which is now the general Secret Service of the United  States.  The bureau was organized with a force of thirty or forty  men, and Stanley W. Finch, who had been chief examiner of the  department, was placed at its head.  

Mr. Finch was not afflicted with any lurid notions about the  spectacular aspects of a detective organization.  He engaged good,  bright, clever lawyers, accountants, bank experts, and a number of  the veteran operatives who had been discharged from the old Secret  Service of the Treasury Department when its field of activity was  circumscribed by the proviso that has been explained.  

The present head of the service is A. Bruce Bielaski, a young  man who entered official life as a laborer in the Department of  Justice, worked his way through law school by studying out of  business hours, demonstrated a peculiar capacity for the business  of investigation, was assigned to this bureau, and in a remarkably  short time rose to be its chief.  

Mr. Bielaski would be more likely to be taken for a clergyman  than for a detective.  He conducts his service on the simple and  rather obvious theory that the best way to get information is to  go to the people who have it, and ask them for it.  Sometimes they  will frankly disclose it.  Sometimes they will try to conceal it,  but will tell more than they intend or realize.  Sometimes they  will try to suppress things which the investigators know they  could tell if they chose; and that is one of the most unwise  things a man can do when the representatives of Uncle Sam ask him  for information.  

It is the experience of the Secret Service people that when a  crime has been done it is commonly useless to attempt shadowing  people who are suspected.  Instead, it is found more effective to  hunt up people who have played minor parts in the criminal  transaction, usually without knowing the significance of what they  were doing.  The Secret Service man goes to such a person, frankly  explains what he wants to know, and asks for information.  

There is no buncombe, no effort at disguising the matter in  hand, no attempt to gain the confidence of the person who is being  questioned by employing misrepresentations.  Instead, he is  advised that his own interest is to be perfectly frank with the  government and to help it.  

In nearly all cases this procedure is effective.  A Secret  Service man of long experience and intimate understanding of human  nature declares that most people are pretty persistent liars about  every-day affairs, but that very few of them will attempt lying  when an officer asks for information.  They prefer to tell the  truth, in the hope that it will keep them out of embarrassing  complications.  More-over, despite their proneness to lie, most  people do it very badly, and the man who attempts it usually  confounds himself early in the game.  

Crimes against the Federal laws almost invariably involve a  considerable number of people.  This does not necessarily mean a  large or elaborate conspiracy; but it does mean that there must be  a pretty widely extended net of circumstances in which a good many  people are involved, most of whom play unwitting parts that give  them information the significance of which they are likely not to  understand.  

Persons in this position are likely to be very willing  witnesses, because of their desire to make plain that they are  entirely innocent.  Thus the officers, starting at the margin of  the net of circumstances, are able to unravel it bit by bit,  increasing their knowledge as they travel inward toward the real  malefactors at the center.  

It is frequently found useful to know all about the character  and antecedents of a person before he is questioned, because this  knowledge frequently indicates the method of most effective  appeal.  How many detectives of the old-fashioned *Nick Carter*  school would have realized, for instance, the value of appealing  to the honor of an officer and a gentleman in order to get a  bridge dynamiter to confess?  

One of the commonest and most effective ways of tracing  criminals is by watching the mails.  A bank teller disappears from  his home town, and it is discovered that he has looted the bank.   There may be absolutely no clue to his whereabouts, but it is  almost certain that before very long he will write to somebody—to  his family or his friends.  The circle of intimates to whose  discretion he could be expected thus to trust himself is  necessarily small and easily conjectured.  

Even in cases of this kind it is not permitted to open first-class mail; but the  post-office authorities cooperate with the  service officials in tracing the courses of mail when proper  request is made.  The missing banker will, of course, write in a  disguised hand, and perhaps will also have an arrangement for  relaying his mail; but the officers are perfectly familiar with  all these methods.  

When a suspected letter is reported, it is traced back to the  point of origin.  Before long it is possible to determine whether  that point is a relay point, and, if so who is the person to whom  the fugitive is sending communications.   After this the  unraveling of the scheme is commonly rather a simple affair.  

Another very useful means of detecting criminals is through  the records that telegraph and telephone corporations keep of  their messages and calls.  If some friend in a bad scrape calls  you on the long-distance phone, or sends you a mysterious message,  you are likely to be surprised at the promptness with which an  insinuating gentleman from the Secret Service will call on you and  urge you to explain the circumstances.  Likewise, you probably  will be surprised at the desire which will suddenly seize you to  give him all possible information.  You will want the insinuating  gentleman distinctly to understand that you are not helping a  criminal to escape.  

It is almost an invariable rule not to attempt any deception  of the person from whom information is desired.  Experience has  proved that when an investigator tries to fool a witness the  witness generally succeeds in fooling him.  Perfect straight-forwardness is generally the effective method.  

It is part of the policy of the Bureau of Investigation not to  let it be known how many people are actually in its service.  The  officials admit that there is not much point to this bit of  mystery, because anybody can read the appropriation bill passed by  Congress, which provides the money, and can see that the present  appropriation is half a million dollars per annum from which to  pay both the salaries and expenses of the employees.  Manifestly,  it cannot be a very large personnel that attempts to cover the  whole country at such an expense.  

Since the passage of the so-called White Slave Act, the  enforcement of which is under this service, a good many local  police officers have been engaged on a fee basis to assist the  work of the Federal officials.  These men are enlisted with a view  to getting the best possible knowledge from such centers as  railroad-stations, hotels, and the like.  

The Bureau of Investigation has grown rapidly since its  establishment, and is likely to grow still faster in the near  future, because of the importance of its work in connection with  plots against the neutrality of the United States.  There has  always been a profound prejudice among Americans against anything  like a system of espionage, and there is not the least danger that  anything like the systems maintained in certain European countries  will ever develop here.  No Congress would pass a law providing  for any such intimate scheme of watching and card-indexing people  as is in vogue in countries like Russia and Germany.  

There, of course, close espionage is justified by the  government's fears of revolutionary plots and military spying in  the interest of hostile neighbors.  In our own country we have  possibly gone to an extreme in protecting individual liberty in  these regards.  

An alien may come to the United States, map our harbors, make  charts of fortifications, and generally familiarize himself with  anything of possible interest, without any fear of apprehension  and punishment, simply because there is no law to prevent such  things.  Again, offenses against American neutrality, by the means  of blowing up industrial establishments, dynamiting railway  bridges, and the like, are offenses against the State in which  they are committed, rather than against the United States.  

There is thus presented a difficult and anomalous situation.   The Federal government possesses the only means with which to  combat such attacks, and yet has no law under which to prosecute  them.  

The need of more direct and efficient laws to empower the  Federal authorities to deal with new classes of offenses is coming  to be generally recognized, and it is believed these will be  passed without much delay.  But nobody imagines that any general  espionage system will ever be attempted in the United States.   There is no need for it, and, except under stress of great and  imminent national peril, the public would never consent to it.
