# DESPERATE.

## I.


    THERE were eight men of us in the room, and we were  discoursing of contemporary events and people.  

"I do not understand these gentlemen," remarked A.  "They are,  as it were, desperate—truly desperate.  There was never yet  anything like it!"  

"No—there was," interposed P., an already old, gray-haired  man; "desperate people have been plentiful before; only they did  not resemble the desperate people of to-day.  Some one said of the  poet Yasicoff that in him was ecstasy, not directed toward  anything—objectless ecstasy.  So it was with those people—their  despair was objectless.  Let me relate to you the history of my  cousin's son, Misha Polteff.  It may serve as an example of the  desperation of those days.  He appeared in God's world in the year  1828, on the ancestral estate of his father, in one of the most  obscure corners of an obscure province of the steppes.  Misha's  father, Andreï Nikolaevitch Polteff, I still remember well.   He was a true landowner of the old school, a pious, serious man,  sufficiently well educated for that time.  To tell the truth, he  was a little crazy and suffering from epilepsy.  But these are old-school and aristocratic maladies.  With andreï Nikolaevitch,  the paroxysms were mild, and they generally resolved themselves  into sleep and melancholy.  He was good-hearted, affable, and not  without a certain haughtiness.  The whole life of Andreï  Nikolaevitch was passed in the prompt performance of all the  ceremonies established from remote times, in strict conformity with  all the customs of the ancient, orthodox, holy Russian existence.   He rose and went to bed, ate and drank and bathed, was merry or  angry (though the second, in truth, rarely happened), even smoked  his pipe and played cards (two great innovations!), not as it  occurred to him to do after his own fashion, but after the law and  ordinance of his fathers—exactly and formally.  He was of high  stature, well-formed and fleshy; he had a soft and somewhat hoarse  voice, as is often the case with worthy Russians; he observed  neatness in his linen and dress, wore white cravats and tobacco-colored, long-skirted surtouts—but his noble blood always showed  itself; no one would have taken him for a priest's son or a  shopkeeper.  Always, upon all possible occasions and meetings,  Andreï Nikolaevitch invariably knew how to act, what to say,  and precisely what expressions to use; he knew when he ought to  doctor himself, and exactly with what—in which omens he ought to  believe, and which might be left unnoticed; in a word, he knew  everything that it was proper to do.  For to old men everything is  foreseen and ordained.  One does not merely imagine it for one's  self.  And the essential thing *is*,  'Without God, not over the threshold.'[^n355]    It must be confessed a mortal dullness reigned in  his house, in those low, warm and dark rooms, so often resounding  with vesper hymns and Te Deums, and pervaded with the almost  irremovable odor of incense and lenten food.  

"Andreï Nikolaevitch, when no longer in his first youth,  married a poor gentlewoman, a neighbor of his, a very nervous and  sickly person, educated at a boarding-school.  She played on the  piano not badly, she spoke French after the boarding-school manner.   She willingly abandoned herself to ecstasy, and still more  willingly did she give herself up to melancholy and even to tears.   In a word, her character was the reverse of tranquil.  Accounting  her life unhappy, she could not love her husband, who 'assuredly'  did not understand her; but she respected and tolerated him, and  being a perfectly honorable and passionless creature, she never  once even thought of another 'object.'  Besides, she was constantly  absorbed by cares firstly, for her own really feeble health;  secondly, for the health of her husband, whose paroxysms always  inspired her with a superstitious terror, and lastly, for     her only son, Misha, whom she educated herself with great zeal.   Andreï Nikolaevitch did not interfere with his wife's training  of Misha, upon the condition that under no pretext whatever should  a departure be made from the order, once for all determined, in  which all should proceed in his house.      

  
## II.


     "I REMEMBER this Misha at thirteen years of age.  He was a  very pretty boy, with rosy cheeks and soft lips (indeed, he was  quite soft and plump all over), with somewhat prominent, humid  eyes; he was carefully combed and brushed, caressing and modest—a  perfect little girl.  Only one thing in him did not please me; he  laughed rarely, but when he did laugh, his teeth, large, white, and  pointed, like those of a wild beast, were unpleasantly displayed,  and in the laugh itself sounded something sharp and even fierce,  almost like a wild beast, and through his eyes ran evil sparks.   His mother praised him because he was so obedient and polite, and  did not love to associate with wanton boys, but attached himself  more and more to the society of women.  'A milksop!' his father,  Andreï Nikolaevitch, said of him.  'A mamma's baby, but he  goes willingly to the Lord's temple, and this rejoices me.'  One  old man, a neighbor, a former police commissioner, said once before  me of Misha, 'By your leave, he will be a rebel,' and this speech,  I remember, then very much astonished me.  The former police  commissioner truly saw the rebel everywhere.  

"Precisely such an exemplary youth did Misha remain until the  eighteenth year of his age, up to the very death of his parents,  whom he lost almost on one and the same day.  Living constantly at  Moscow, I heard nothing of my young relative.  It is true, a person  who came from his province assured me that Misha had sold his  paternal estate for a song, but this news appeared to me  incredible.  

"Suddenly, one autumn morning, a barouche entered the  courtyard of my house, drawn by an excellent pair of trotters, with  a monstrous coachman on the box; and in the barouche, wrapped in a  cloak of military cut, with two  arsheen [^n336] of otter fur collar, with  his traveling-cap worn on one side in a devil-may-care fashion, sat  Misha!  Seeing me (I stood at the window of the drawing-room, and  gazed with astonishment at the entering equipage), he began to  laugh his sharp laugh, and lightly throwing aside the ends of the  cloak, jumped from the barouche and ran into the house.  

"'Misha!  Mikhaïl Andreëvitch!' I began.  'Is this  you?'  

"'Call me "thou" and "Misha,"' he interrupted me.  'Yes, this  is I—in my own person.  I have appeared in Moscow, to look at the  people, and to show myself! and so I drove to you.  What trotters,  eh!' he again began to laugh.  

"Although seven years had passed since I had last seen Misha,  I recognized him immediately.  His face had remained quite  youthful, and was, as before, charming; even the mustache had not  yet pierced through, only there was a puffiness in his cheeks,  under his eyes, and from his mouth came the odor of wine.  

"'And have you been long in Moscow?' I asked.  'I supposed  that you were managing your estate.'  

"'Ah! the estate I immediately put one side.  As soon as my  parents (may the kingdom of heaven be theirs!) died (Misha crossed  himself, simply, without the slightest mockery), I immediately,  without the least delay—one—two—three—ha! ha!  It slipped off  cheaply—trickery!  The rascal so insinuated himself!  O well, it  is all the same.  At least, I live to my satisfaction, and I amuse  others.  But why do you stare at me so?  Was it possible for me to  drag the thing along any further?  Little dove of a cousin, can not  one have a glass?'  

"Misha spoke with extreme rapidity, and at the same time as if  half asleep.  

"'Misha!  For Heaven's sake!  Fear God!  Whom do you  resemble—with such a look?  And asking for a glass!  And to sell  so fine an estate for nothing!'  

"'I always fear and remember God,' he replied.  'And really he  is good—God—to pardon.  And I also am good.  I never yet in my  life harmed any one.  And a little glass is also good.  It harms no  one.  Little uncle, do you wish me to spin round the table with a  cord, whip out the ace with my last?  Or shall I dance a little?'     

"'Pray spare me!  What, dance here!  You would better sit  down.'  

"'I will sit down.  But why do you say nothing to me about my  grays?  Look, they are really lions.  Until now I have hired them,  but I shall undoubtedly buy them, together with the coachman.  And  I really had the money; yes, I let it slip yesterday at the  gambling-table.  It is nothing!  We shall revenge ourselves tomorrow.  Uncle, how about the little glass!'  

"'By your leave, I could no longer contain myself.  Misha, how  old are you?  Not with horses, not with card-playing, should you  busy yourself, but should enter either the university or the army.'  

"Misha at first again began to laugh, then whistled  protractedly.  'Well, uncle, I see you are now in a melancholy  frame of mind.  I will drop in another time.  Here is something for  you.  Drive out in the evening to the "Falconer."  There is a tent  erected for me.  The gipsies sing.  Will you?  Only observe, and on  the tent is a pennon, and on the pennon in magical gold letters is  written "Chorus of Polteff Gipsies!"  The pennon curves itself like  a snake—the letters are golden—it is enticing to every one to  read.  Refreshments for whoever wishes it; I refuse nothing.  The  dust has gone all over Moscow.  My respects!  Will you come?  And—  there is with me there such an—aspic!  Black as a boot—wicked as  a dog—and eyes—coals!  It is impossible to tell whether she will  kiss or bite.  Will you come, uncle?  Well, until we meet!'  

"And suddenly embracing me and slapping me on the shoulder,  Misha hurried into the court and into the barouche, waved his  traveling-cap above his head, gave a yell, and the monstrous  coachman squinted at him across his beard, the trotters tore off,  and all disappeared.  

"On the following day I, sinful man, drove out to the  'Falconer,' and actually saw the tent with the pennon and  inscription.  

"The skirts of the tent were raised; noise, tumult, yells  proceeded thence.  The people crowded around; on the ground, on a  spread carpet sat gipsy men and women, who sang and beat  kettledrums; and in the midst of them, with guitar in his hands, in  a red silk shirt and wide velvet trousers, whirled Misha, turning  a pirouette.  'Gentlemen!  Your reverences!  We ask your mercy!   The performance will begin immediately.  Gratis,' cried he, in a  cracked voice.  'Hollo!  Champagne!  Clap!  On the forehead!  On  the floor!'  

"Luckily he did not see me, and I hastened to withdraw.  

"I will not, gentlemen, enlarge my astonishment at the sight  of such an alteration.  And indeed, how could this gentle and  modest boy have changed suddenly into a drunken wag?  Is it  possible that all this lurked in him in childhood, and showed  itself as soon as the pressure of parental authority was removed  from him?  And that 'dust went from him over Moscow,' as he  expressed himself, there was certainly no longer any kind of doubt.   I led a wild life at his age, but here appeared something frenzied,  a certain madness of self-destruction, a desperation.      

  
## III.


     "THIS amusement lasted two months.  I stood again at the  window of the drawing-room and looked out on the court.  A novice-monk entered the gate with a slow step.  A conical cap was drawn  down on his forehead, his hair fell scattered right and left under  it—he wore a long cassock with a leathern girdle.  Could it be  Misha?  It was he.  

"I went to the stairway to meet him.  'What is this  masquerade?' I asked.  

"'It is not a masquerade, uncle,' Misha answered me, with a  deep sigh; 'but as I have spent my fortune to the last copeck, and  as powerful repentance has taken possession of me, I have decided  to set off for the Sergius monastery of the Holy Trinity to pray  for my sins.  For what asylum now remains to me?  And I have come  to take leave of you, uncle, as a prodigal son.'  

"I looked steadfastly at Misha.  His face was as rosy and  fresh as ever (for that matter, it did not change to the last), his  eyes were humid and kind, somewhat languid, his small hands were  white—but, he smelt of wine.  

"'Well?' I said at length; 'the affair is good if there be no  other way out!  But why do you smell of wine?'  

"'Old leaven,' answered Misha, and suddenly began to laugh,  but immediately recollecting himself, he bent low and straight in  a monastic salute and added, 'If you please     something—a  little luck-greeting for the journey.  I am really going on foot to  the monastery.'  

"'When?'  

"'To-day—directly.'  

"'Why, then, are you in such a hurry?'  

"'Uncle!  My motto has always been—"Faster!  Faster!"'  

"'And what is your motto now?'  

"'It is the same also now—only faster to the—good!'  

"So Misha went away, leaving me to meditate over the  vicissitudes of human destinies.  But he soon reminded me of his  existence.  Two months after his visit, I received from him a  letter, the first of those letters with which he subsequently  favored me.  And mark the singularity!  I have rarely seen a neater  and more legible handwriting than this scatterbrained fellow  possessed.  And the style of his letter was very correct, slightly  oratorical.  Invariable demands for assistance alternated with  promises of reform, with honorable speeches and vows.  All this  seemed, and possibly was, sincere.  Misha's scrawl under the  letter, was continually accompanied by peculiar flourishes, dashes,  periods, and a great many exclamation-marks.  In this first letter,  Misha informed me of the new 'turn of his fortunes.'  Subsequently  he called these turns 'plunges,' and he 'plunged' often.  He was  going out to the Caucasus to serve 'with his breast,' his tsar and  country in the capacity of a cavalry subaltern.  And although a  certain benevolent aunt came to the relief of his distressed  condition and sent him a small sum, he asked my assistance in  equipping himself.  I acceded to his demand, and heard nothing of  him again for the space of two years.  I confess, I strongly  doubted whether he had gone to the Caucasus.  But it appeared that  he had gone thither, that through patronage he had entered the  T— regiment as an under-officer, and served in it these two  years.  The wildest stories were afloat concerning him.  They were  related to me by an officer of his regiment.      

  
## IV.

   "I LEARNED much of a kind that I had not expected from him.   It did not astonish me, assuredly, that as a military man, as an  ardent soldier, he should show himself inferior, even, frankly,  worthless; but what I did not expect was this: that personal  bravery was not remarked in him, that in battle he wore a  melancholy and drooping look, now bored, now alarmed.  All  discipline oppressed him, inspired him with sadness; he was bold to  madness when the matter concerned only himself personally; there  was no wager so foolish that he would refuse to accept it; but to  injure another—to kill—to fight—this he could not do; it might  have been because his heart was good, and it might have been  because his 'cotton-wool education,' as he expressed it, had made  him effeminate.  He was always and forever ready to destroy  himself, but others—no.  'The devil will take him away,' his  companions remarked of him.  'He is withered up!  A clout!  And a  desperate one!  Truly, a confirmation-child!'  

"Subsequently I asked Misha how this evil report got about—  what obliged him to drink deep, to risk his life, and so forth?  He  had always the same answer—'grief.'  

"'How, if you please, grief?'  

"'One comes thus to one's self—one regains one's senses—one  falls to meditating over poverty—over injustice—over Russia!   Well—it is done!  Immediately—grief—as if there were a bullet in  one's forehead.  One begins to debauch, in spite of one's self.'  

"'What made you drag yourself back hither to Russia?'  

"'Only this!  I am afraid to think of it.'  

"'All this grief of yours comes from inactivity.'  

"'But I do not know how to do anything, uncle—cousin.  To  wager even my life at cards, to play parole, to give a crack on  the collar—this I know how to do.  You, here, tell me how I can  risk my life for something.'  

"'But why not live a simple life?  Why risk it?'  

"'I can not—you say I act without reflection.  One begins to  reflect—and at once riot ferments in one's head.  Only these  Germans reflect.'  

"How could one manage to talk with him?  Desperate—  completely!  

"Among the number of Caucasian stories which I mentioned I  shall relate to you two or three.  Once, in a company of officers,  Misha began to boast of a bartered saber—a genuine Persian blade.   The officers expressed a doubt as to its genuineness.     Misha  began to argue.  'Well,' exclaimed he, at length, 'they say in the  matter of blades the first connoisseur is Abdulka the Crooked.  I  will go to him and inquire.'  

"The officers were astonished.  'Who is this Abdulka?  The one  who lives in the hills—not the tributary, Abdul Khan?'  

"'He himself!'  

"'He will arrest you as a spy and put you in prison, provided  he does not cut off your head with this very sword.  And how shall  you reach him?  They will kill you immediately.'  

"'All the same I will go to him.'  

"'A wager that you do not go.  A wager!'  

"And Misha immediately saddled his horse and rode off to  Abdulka.  Three days passed.  All were convinced that he had come  to the end predicted.  Behold, he returned—somewhat intoxicated,  and with a saber—only not that which he had taken away.  They  began to question him.  'It is nothing,' he said.  'Abdulka is a  good man.  At first, truly, he ordered my feet to be fettered and  prepared to impale me.  I explained to him why I had come, and  showed him the saber.  "Do not detain me," and "do not expect a  ransom for me.  I have not a copeck to my name, and I have no  relations."  Abdulka was astonished; he gazed at me with his  solitary eye.  "Now," he says, "you rogue, you!  Ought I to believe  you?"  "Believe me," I said: "I never lie" (and really Misha never  lied).  Again Abdulka gazed at me.  "Do you know how to drink  wine?"  "I know how," I said.  "I will drink as much as you will  give me."  Again Abdulka was astonished, called upon Allah.  And  hereupon he bade his little daughter (very pretty, only with a look  like a jackal) to drag in the wineskin.  And I fell to work.  "But  your saber," said he, "is counterfeit—here, take a genuine one.   Now we are friends."  And you have lost your wager, gentlemen.   Pay!'  

"The second legend of Misha is of like nature.  He loved cards  passionately, but as money was not abundant with him, and he did  not pay card-debts (although a cheater he never was), no one would  play with him.  He once began to urge one of his fellow-officers—  he really must play with him.  

"'And if you lose, you will not pay.'  

"'I will not pay with money, but I will shoot myself through  the left hand with this very pistol.'  

"'And what advantage will there be to me in this?'  

"'No advantage, but all the same it will be interesting.'  

"This conversation took place after a drinking-bout, before  witnesses.  Misha's proposition did appear interesting to the  officer.  The cards were brought, the game began.  Misha was in  luck—he won a hundred roubles.  

"Hereupon his adversary struck himself on the forehead.  'What  a booby I am!' he exclaimed.  'What a snare I have fallen into!  If  you had lost, you would have shot yourself through the hand—but  now you hold your pistol-pocket fast.'  

"'You have lied,' replied Misha.  'I have won, and I will  shoot myself through the hand.'  He seized the pistol.  Pop!  The  ball passed through, and a week later the wound was completely  healed.  

"Still another time Misha was riding along a road at night  with his companions.  And they saw by the side of the road yawn a  narrow ravine, yawning—dark, very dark—the bottom not visible.  

"'Here,' said one of his comrades, 'desperate as Misha is, he  will not jump into this ravine.'  

"'No, I will jump.'  

"'No, you will not jump, because it is ten sajens  [^n337] deep, and  it is certain to break one's neck.'  

"'But all the same I shall jump.  Do you want a bet?'  

"'Ten roubles.'  

"'Good!'  

"And his comrade had not finished uttering this word when  Misha was off his horse, at the ravine, and had begun to rattle  down among the stones.  All were benumbed.  A full minute passed  and they heard, borne up as it were from the bowels of the earth,  the sound of Misha's voice.  

"'I have fallen on sand.  But I flew a long time!  Ten roubles  from you.'  

"'Climb out!' his companions began to cry.  

"'Yes—climb out,' retorted Misha.  'I should say so!  You  must go for ropes and lanterns, and meanwhile, so that I do not get  tired waiting, throw me down the flask.'        

"Misha sat five hours in the bottom of the ravine, and when  they dragged him out his shoulder was dislocated—but this did not  disturb him in the least.  On the following day, the bonesetter  from the blacksmith's set his shoulder, and he handled him as if  nothing were the matter.

     "FROM the Caucasus he again appeared in Moscow, in Circassian  costume, with cartridge-boxes on his breast, a dagger in his  girdle, a high fur cap on his head.  He did not part with this  costume until the end, although he was no longer in the military  service, being expelled on account of his non-appearance at drill.   He made a short call on me, borrowed a little money, and began  another course of 'plunges' by begging.  Beautifully written  letters were scattered abroad, addressed to all possible persons,  beginning with the metropolite and ending with the riding-masters  and professional nurses.  Visits were made to acquaintances and  strangers.  But in making his visits he was neither servile nor  importunate.  On the contrary, he bore himself decorously and even  with a cheerful mien, although a chronic odor of wine accompanied  him everywhere, and his Oriental costume by degrees became  transformed into tatters.  'If you give, God will reward you,  although I do not deserve it.  If you do not give, you will be  quite right and I will not be at all angry.  I feed myself, thanks  to God!  For there are people poorer than I and much more worthy of  assistance—much, very much.'  

"During his impecunious travels he reached his paternal nest,  sold by him for a trifle to a well-known speculator and usurer.   The speculator was at home, and hearing of the arrival of the  former possessor, transformed into a vagrant, he gave orders that  he should not be admitted into the house, and in case of need  should even be thrust out by the neck.  Misha declared that he  would not go into the house contaminated by the presence of the  rogue, and he set off for the graveyard to pray over the dust of  his parents.  In the graveyard he was joined by an old man, a  house-servant, who had once been his nurse.  The speculator had  deprived the old man of his monthly allowance and driven him away  from the manor-house.  The latter had found a refuge in the corner  of a peasant's hut.  Misha had not left behind him an especially  good memory; but when the old servant learned of the arrival of his  young lord, he immediately ran to the graveyard, found Misha  sitting on the ground between the tombstones, asked of him for old  memories' sake his little hand, and shed tears upon the tatters  with which were clothed the once daintily attired limbs of his  nursling.  Misha gazed long and silently at the old man.  

"'Timotheï,' said he, at length.  

"Timotheï shuddered.  'What is your pleasure?'  

"'Have you a shovel?'  

"'It is possible to procure one.  But what do you want a  shovel for, Mr. Mikhaïl Andreïtch?'  

"'I wish to dig a little grave for myself here,  Timotheï—yes, and to lie here forever and ever between my  parents.  Truly, only one little place is left to me in the world.   Bring the shovel.'  

"'I obey,' said Timotheï.  He went and brought it.  And  Misha immediately began to dig the earth and Timotheï stood  near, supporting his chin on his hand, and repeating, 'Only you and  I are left, lord.'  And Misha dug and dug, from time to time  inquiring, 'It is really not worth while to live, is it,  Timotheï?'  'It is not worth while, little father.'  The grave  had already become tolerably deep.  The people saw Misha's work,  and ran to report upon it to the new possessor.  The speculator was  at first angry and wished to send for the police—this, then, is  sacrilege!  But afterward, probably considering that to have an  affair with this madman would be inexpedient and might result in  scandal, he went to the graveyard and, approaching Misha, who was  working for dear life, politely saluted him.  The latter continued  to dig, as if not remarking his successor.  

"'Mikhaïl Andreïtch,' began the speculator, 'permit  me to learn what you are doing here.'  

"'Don't you see—I am digging a grave for myself.'  

"'Why is this?'  

"'Because I do not wish to live any longer.'  

"The speculator raised his hands.  'You do not wish to live?'  

"Misha looked menacingly at the speculator.      'Does  this astonish you?  Are you not the cause of all—are you not?  Did  you not, Judas, rob me, taking advantage of my youth?  Did you not  tear the skin from the peasants?  Did you not deprive this decrepit  man here of his bread?  Did you not?  O Lord!  Everywhere only  injustice, and oppression, and wickedness.  Perish—it means—all.   I do not wish to live—I do not—to live any longer in Russia!'   And the shovel began to move still more rapidly in Misha's hands.  

"'The devil knows what this all is,' thought the speculator;  'really, in truth, he will bury himself.  Mikhaïl  Andreïtch,' he began again, 'listen; I am indeed guilty before  you.  They did not so speak of you to me.'  Misha dug.  'But why  this desperation?'  Misha went on digging, and threw the earth on  the feet of the speculator.  'Will it not please you to come to my  house to eat a bite and rest a little?'  

"Misha slightly raised his head.  'And will there be some  drinking?'  

"'If you like.  Why should there not?'  

"'And you invite Timotheï?'  

"'Why not?  Him, too.'  

"Misha began to reflect.  'Only, look you, you thrust me out  into the world.  Do not think to escape with one little bottle.'  

"'Do not be uneasy.  There shall be as much as you like of  everything.'  

"Misha rose and threw down the shovel.  'Well, Timotheï,'  he turned to the old man-nurse, 'let us respect the master.  Let us  go.'  

"'I obey,' answered the old man.  And all three repaired to  the house.  

"The speculator knew with whom he had to deal.  Misha, it is  true, at first made him promise that he would bestow upon the  peasants immunity from all imposts; but an hour later that same  Misha, together with Timotheï, both drunk, danced a gallopade  in those very rooms in which still lodged the God-fearing phantom  of Andreï Nikolaevitch, and an hour later, the heavily-sleeping Misha, lying in the telega together with his high fur cap  and his dagger, set off for the city, twenty-five versts distant,  and was lodged there under a shed.  As for Timotheï, who still  stood on his feet and only hiccoughed, he was put out.  One does  not get rid of a gentleman in the same way as of a servant.      

  
## VI.


     "AGAIN some time passed and I heard nothing of Misha.  God  knows whither he had disappeared.  Here, once, sitting by the  samovar in the station of the T— highway waiting for horses, I  suddenly heard, under the open window of the waiting-room, a hoarse  voice, saying in French, 'Sir! sir! take pity on a poor ruined  gentleman.'  I raised my head and looked.  A mangy fur cap, broken  cartridge-boxes on the torn Circassian coat, a dagger in a cracked  sheath, a swollen but yet rosy face, disheveled but still thick  hair—my God!  Misha!  He had begun to ask alms on the highway.  I  involuntarily cried out.  He recognized me, shuddered, turned away.   I detained him, but what was to be said to him—read him a moral  lecture?  In silence I held out to him a five-rouble bank-note; he  as silently took it, with his still white and plump, though  trembling and dirty little hand, and disappeared round the corner  of the house.  They were slow in bringing up the horses, and it  troubled me that I had so coldly allowed him to go away.  I drove  on farther, and at half a verst from the station I found before me  on the road a crowd of people advancing with an odd, as it were,  measured step.  I overtook this crowd, and what did I see?  Twelve  beggar-men, with their bags across their shoulders, were walking,  two and two, singing and leaping, and in front of them danced  Misha, stamping his feet in time, and repeating "Ready and lively!  step—step—step!'  As soon as my barouche stopped near him and he  saw me, he immediately began to cry 'Halt!  Right about!  Front!   Guard the highway!'  The beggars caught up his cry and stopped, and  he with his customary laugh leaped onto the carriage step, and  again cried 'Hurrah!'  

"'What is all this?' I asked, in involuntary amazement.  

"'This?  This is my corps, my army, all little beggars—God's  people—comrades, friends.  Every one of them, through your  kindness, has drunk a little glass; and hereupon we all rejoice and  make merry.  Uncle, really only with beggars—with God's people—is  it possible to live in the world.'  

"I answered him nothing, but he seemed to me at this time such  a good fellow, his      face expressed such childish  ingenuousness, that something, as it were, suddenly flashed upon  me, something pricked me in the heart.  

"'Sit down by me in the carriage,' I said to him.  He was  astonished.  

"'What!  In the carriage?'  

"'Sit down!  Sit down!' I repeated, 'I wish to make a  proposition to you.  Sit down!  Let us go to my house!'  

"'Well, as you command.'  He sat down.  

"'Now, you dear friends, worthy comrades,' he said, turning to  the beggars.  'Good-by, until we meet!'  Misha took off his fur cap  and bowed low.  The beggars were all literally disconcerted.  I  ordered the coachman to whip up the horses, and the carriage rolled  on.  The thought had suddenly come to me to take him home to my  country-house, at a distance of thirty versts from that station—to  save him, or at least to attempt to.  

"'Listen, Misha,' I said, 'do you wish to settle down with me?   You shall live comfortably, you will be provided with clothes and  linen, you shall be suitably equipped, and money will be given you  for tobacco, and the like, on one condition—not to drink wine.   Are you agreed?'  

"Misha was even frightened with joy; he opened his eyes wide,  grew purple, and suddenly falling on my shoulder, began to kiss me,  and to repeat in a broken voice, 'Uncle—benefactor!  God reward  you.'  He fell into a fit of weeping, and taking off his fur cap,  occupied himself with wiping his eyes, nose and lips.  

"'Remember the promise—not to drink wine.'  

"'And may it be cursed,' he exclaimed, flourishing both arms,  still more strongly enveloping me in that spirituous odor with  which he was saturated.  

"'Really, uncle, if you knew my life—really, if not grief—  harsh fate!  For that reason, I swear, I swear, I will reform—I  will prove.  Uncle, I never lied—ask any one.  I am an honorable  but an unhappy man, uncle.  I have received no kindness from any  one.'  Here he finally broke off.  I endeavored to calm him, and  succeeded in so far that when we drew up before my house Misha was  already sleeping heavily, resting his head on my lap.

     "HE was immediately given a room to himself, and was put into  a bath.  All his apparel, his dagger and fur cap and boots full of  holes, were carefully laid away in a pantry; clean linen was put on  him, slippers, and some of my clothing, which exactly suited his  build and height.  When he came to table, washed, neat, fresh, he  seemed so contrite and happy, he beamed all over with such joyous  gratitude, that I was delighted.  His face was quite transformed.   Boys of twelve years wear such a face on Easter Sunday, when, after  communion, heavily oiled, in new jackets and starched collars, they  go to keep the festival with their parents.  Misha continually felt  of himself, cautiously and distrustfully, and repeated all the  time, 'What is this?  Am I not in heaven?'  And on the following  day he declared that he could not sleep all night from ecstasy.  In  my house lived then an old aunt with her niece; they were both  extremely disturbed when they learned of the presence of Misha;  they did not understand how I could invite him to my house.  A very  evil report of him was abroad.  But I knew that he was always very  polite with ladies, and I built hopes on his promise to reform.   For the first two days under my roof Misha not only answered my  expectations, but surpassed them, and he simply enchanted my  ladies.  With the old lady he played piquet, he assisted her to  unwind her yarn, he showed her two new games of patience; the  niece, who had something of a voice, he accompanied on the piano,  read to her Russian and French verses; he related to both ladies  merry but decorous anecdotes; in a word he rendered them divers  services, so that they more than once expressed to me their  astonishment, and the old lady even remarked that here could be  seen how unjust people sometimes are.  There was nothing they did  not say—he was so gentle and well-bred—poor Misha!  It is true at  the table his mouth visibly watered every time he only so much as  looked at a bottle.  But I had only to threaten him a little with  my finger, and he raised his eyes to heaven, and pressed his hand  to his heart.  'I have sworn!  I am now regenerated,' he assured  me.  

"'God grant it!' thought I.  But this regeneration did not  last long.  

"Beginning with the third day, he grew     silent;  although, as before, he remained near the ladies and entertained  them.  Now a melancholy, now a thoughtful expression began to flit  across his face, and his face itself became pale and apparently  thin.  'Are you indisposed?' I asked him.  'Yes,' he replied, 'my  head aches a little.'  

"On the fourth day he was entirely silent; he sat in the  corner, bowing his head, like an orphan, and with his despondent  look awakening a feeling of compassion in both ladies, who now, in  their turn, endeavored to entertain him.  At table he ate nothing,  looked at his plate, and rolled bread-balls.  On the fifth day, the  feeling of pity in the ladies changed to distrust and even fear.   Misha grew wild, held aloof from people, and crept along the wall  as if thieving, looking suddenly around, exactly as if some one  called him.  And what had become of the rosy color of his face?  

"'Are you not well?' I asked him.  

"'No—I am well,' he answered, abruptly.  

"'Are you bored?'  

"'Bored—with what?'  But he turned away and did not look me  in the eye.  On the following day, my aunt came to me in my study  in great agitation, and declared that she would leave my house with  her niece, if Misha was to remain in it.  'He is not a man—he is  a wolf.  He walks—walks—so silent, and so wild.  He almost  gnashes his teeth.  Katia and I are so nervous.  At first we were  very much interested in him, but now we are afraid of his  craziness.'  I did not know what answer to make.  I could not drive  Misha away, for I had invited him to my house.  He soon relieved me  from the embarrassing position.  

"On that same day I suddenly heard a hollow and angry voice,  'Nikolaï Nikolaïtch!  Nikolaï Nikolaïtch!'  I  looked around.  Misha stood at the door with a frightful,  darkening, distorted countenance.  

"'Nikolaï Nikolaïtch,' he repeated (no longer  'Uncle').  

"'What is the matter with you?'  

"'Let me go, directly.  Let me go or I shall do some mischief!   I shall set fire to the house or murder some one.'  Misha suddenly  began to shudder.  'Order my clothing to be returned to me, let  them take me in a telega as far as the high-road, and give me a  trifle of money.'  

"'Are you then dissatisfied?' I began.  He began to cry at the  top of his voice, 'I can not live in your accursed gentleman's  house.  It oppresses me to live so tranquilly.  I wonder how you  bear it!'  'That is,' I interrupted him, 'you mean you can not live  without wine.'  'Well, yes; well, yes,' he began to cry again;  'only let me go to my brothers, to my friends, to the beggars—away  from your decorous and contrary nobleman's breed.'  I wished to  remind him of his sworn promises, but the excited expression of  Misha's face, his broken voice, the convulsive trembling of all his  limbs, all this was so dreadful that I hastened to escape from him.   I declared to him that his clothes would be given to him  immediately, that a telega should be harnessed for him, and taking  from my drawer a twenty-rouble bank-note, I laid it on table.   Misha had already begun to approach me with threats, but here he  suddenly controlled himself, his face became contracted, he struck  himself on the breast, the tears started from his eyes, and  murmuring, 'Uncle!  Angel!  Really I am a lost man,' he seized the  bank-note and ran out.  

"An hour later he was already seated in the telega, again  dressed in his Circassian coat, again rosy and joyous, and when the  horses moved from the place, he chirruped, pulled off his fur cap  and waving it above his head, made bow after bow.  Just before his  departure, he long and closely embraced me and stammered,  'Benefactor!  Benefactor!  It is impossible to save me.'  He even  ran to the ladies and kissed their hands over and over again,  placed himself on his knees, called upon God and asked forgiveness.   Katia I afterward found in tears.  

"But the coachman with whom Misha had taken his departure, on  his return, reported to me that he had driven him to the first  dramshop on the highway, and that there they stopped and began to  treat everybody without distinction, and soon was unconsciousness.   >From this time on I no longer met Misha, but I learned his final  fate in the following manner.      

  
## VIII.


     "THREE years later I again found myself on my estate.   Suddenly the domestic entered my apartment, and announced that Mrs.  Polteva was asking for me.  I knew no     Mrs. Polteva, and the  servant making the announcement smiled with inquiring sarcasm.  To  my interrogative glance, he answered that a lady was asking for  me—young, poorly-dressed—and that she had come in a peasant's  telega with one horse, and had driven herself.  I ordered him to  ask Mrs. Polteva to come to me in my study.  

"I saw a woman of twenty-five years of age, in the dress of  the middle class, with a large handkerchief on her head.  Her face  was open, round, and not without attractiveness.  Her expression  was gloomy and somewhat mournful, her movements shy.  

"'You are Mrs. Polteva?' I asked.  

"'Exactly so,' she answered in a soft voice, refusing to sit  down.  'I am the widow of your nephew, Mikhaïl  Andreëvitch Polteff.'  

"Mikhaïl Andreëvitch is dead?  How long?  But sit  down, I beg of you.'  

"She let herself down on a chair.  

"'The second month has passed.'  

"'And had you been long married?'  

"'I had lived with him a whole year.'  

"'Where have you come from now?'  

"'I am from below Toula.  There is a village there—Zuamenskoe  Gloushkovo—it may be you would like to know I am the daughter of  a sacristan there.  We lived there with Mikhaïl  Andreëvitch.  He settled down with my father.  A whole year we  lived together there.'  

"The young woman's lips began to quiver, and she raised her  hand to them.  It seemed as though she were about to cry, but she  recovered herself, coughing.  

"'The late Mikhaïl Andreëvitch,' she continued,  'before his death, instructed me to come to you.  "Without fail,"  he said, "go."  And he said to me that I should thank you for all  your kindness, and that I should give you—here—this—very—little  thing'—she took from her pocket a small packet—'which he always  carried about him, and Mikhaïl Andreëvitch said—if it  will please you to accept this in memory of him—if you do not  disdain it—"nothing else have I to give," said he—that is—you—   I can not, I can not—'  

"In the little packet was a small silver cup bearing the  cipher of Misha's mother.  This cup I had often seen in Misha's  hands, and once he said to me, speaking of a certain poor fellow,  that he was indeed destitute, since he had neither a little cup nor  a little lamp, 'and I have this!'  

"I thanked her, took the little cup, and asked her of what  disease Misha died.  'Probably—'  Here, I bit my tongue, but the  young woman understood my intimation.  She quickly looked at me,  then cast down her eyes and mournfully repeated, 'Ah, no; this he  forsook from the time that we became acquainted with him.  Only  what health was his!  Quite ruined!  As soon as he stopped  drinking, directly his sickness came to light.  So he became  steady, wished to help father in everything—at farming, or in the  garden, or whatever came to hand—in vain—for he was of noble  race.  Only where to get strength?  Also, he wished to occupy  himself with writing; this, as you know, he could do beautifully,  but his hands shook and he could not hold the pen properly.  He  always reproached himself: "I—a fine gentleman—did no good to any  one—I did not help—I did not work."  He was very much cast down  about this, and he said that our people worked, but we—what—  Nikolaï Nikolaïtch, he was a good man, and he loved me—  and I, ah—pardon—'  

"Here the young woman fell to weeping outright.  I would have  liked to comfort her, but I did not know how.  

"Is there a baby left you?' I asked.  

"She sighed.  'No, there is none—and if there had been—'   And the tears flowed still more freely.  

         —    

"This is the end to which Misha was brought," concluded the  old man.  "You gentlemen, assuredly, are agreed with me that I was  right in calling him desperate; but probably you are also agreed  upon this, that he did not resemble the desperate people of to-day,  although it may be supposed that a philosopher would discover  analogous features between him and them.  Here there was a thirst  for self-destruction—grief—dissatisfaction, and what all this  signifies I leave to the philosopher to judge."
