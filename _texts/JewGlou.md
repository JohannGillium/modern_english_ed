        	  THE GLOUCESTER MOTHER   BY  SARAH ORNE JEWETT  DECORATION BY WLADYSLAW T. BENDA        - WHEN Autumn winds are high
 - They wake and trouble me,
 - With thoughts of people lost
 - A-coming on the coast,
 - And all the ships at sea.
  - How dark, how dark and cold,
 - And fearful in the waves
 - Are tired folk who lie not still
 - And quiet in their graves:—
 - In moving waters deep,
 - That will not let men sleep
 - As they may sleep on any hill;
 - May sleep ashore till time is old,
 - And all the earth is frosty cold.—
 - Under the flowers a thousand springs
 - They sleep and dream of many things.
  - God bless them all who die at sea!
 - If they must sleep in restless waves,
 - God make them dream they are ashore,
 - With grass above their graves.
