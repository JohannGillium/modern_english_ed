# AN INDIAN TEACHER AMONG INDIANS. 
*Atlantic Monthly* 85 (1900): 381-86. 

  
#  MY FIRST DAY.

    THOUGH an illness left me unable to continue my college  course, my pride kept me from returning to my mother.  Had she  known of my worn condition, she would have said the white man's  papers were not worth the freedom and health I had lost by them.   Such a rebuke from my mother would have been unbearable, and as I  felt then it would be far too true to be comfortable.  

 Since the winter when I had my first dreams about red apples  I had been traveling slowly toward the morning horizon.  There had  been no doubt about   the direction in which I wished to go  to spend my energies in a work for the Indian race.  Thus I had  written my mother briefly, saying my plan for the year was to teach  in an Eastern Indian school.  Sending this message to her in the  West, I started at once eastward.  

 Thus I found myself, tired and hot, in a black veiling of car  smoke, as I stood wearily on a street corner of an old-fashioned  town, waiting for a car.  In a few moments more I should be on the  school grounds, where a new work was ready for my inexperienced  hands.  

 Upon entering the school campus, I was surprised at the  thickly clustered buildings which made it a quaint little village,  much more interesting than the town itself.  The large trees among  the house gave the place a cool, refreshing shade, and the grass a  deeper green.  Within this large court of grass and trees stood a  low green pump.  The queer boxlike case had a revolving handle on  its side, which clanked and creaked constantly.  

 I made myself known and was shown to my room,—a small,  carpeted room, with ghastly walls and ceiling.  The two windows,  both on the same side, were curtained with heavy muslin yellowed  with age.  A clean white bed was in one corner of the room, and  opposite it was a square pine table covered with a black woolen  blanket.  

 Without removing my hat from my head, I seated myself in one  of the two stiff-backed chairs that were placed beside the table.   For several heart throbs I sat still, looking from ceiling to  floor, from wall to wall, trying hard to imagine years of  contentment there.  Even while I was wondering if my exhausted  strength would sustain me through this undertaking, I heard a heavy  tread stop at my door.  Opening it, I met the imposing figure of a  stately gray-haired man.  With a light straw hat in one hand, and  the right hand extended for greeting, he smiled kindly upon me.   For some reason I was awed by his wondrous height and his strong  square shoulders, which I felt were a finger's length above my  head.  

 I was always slight, and my serious illness in the early  spring had made me look rather frail and languid.  His quick eye  measured my height and breadth.  Then he looked into my face.  I  imagined that a visible shadow flitted across his countenance as he  let my hand fall.  I knew he was no other than my employer.  

 "Ah ha! so you are the little Indian girl who created the  excitement among the college orators!" he said, more to himself  than to me.  I thought I heard a subtle note of disappointment in  his voice.  Looking in from where he stood, with one sweeping  glance, he asked if I lacked anything for my room.  

 After he turned to go, I listened to his step until it grew  faint and was lost in the distance.  I was aware that my car-smoked  appearance had not concealed the lines of pain on my face.  

 For a short moment my spirit laughed at my ill fortune, and I  entertained the idea of exerting myself to make an improvement.   But as I tossed my hat off a leaden weakness came over me, and I  felt as if years of weariness lay like water-soaked logs upon me.   I threw myself upon the bed, and, closing my eyes, forgot my good  intention.    

                                   
#  A TRIP WESTWARD.

     One sultry month I sat at a desk heaped up with work.  Now, as  I recall it, I wonder how I could have dared to disregard nature's  warning with such recklessness.  Fortunately, my inheritance of a  marvelous endurance enabled me to bend without breaking.  

 Though I had gone to and fro, from my room to the office, in  an unhappy   silence, I was watched by those around me.  On  an early morning I was summoned to the superintendent's office.   For a half hour I listened to his words, and when I returned to my  room I remembered one sentence above the rest.  It was this: "I am  going to turn you loose to pasture!"  He was sending me West to  gather Indian pupils for the school, and this was his way of  expressing it.  

 I needed nourishment, but the mid-summer's travel across the  continent to search the hot prairies for overconfident parents who  would intrust their children to strangers was a lean pasturage.   However, I dwelt on the hope of seeing my mother.  I tried to  reason that a change was a rest.  Within a couple of days I started  toward my mother's home.  

 The intense heat and the sticky car smoke that followed my  homeward trail did not noticeably restore my vitality.  Hour after  hour I gazed upon the country which was receding rapidly from me.   I noticed the gradual expansion of the horizon as we emerged out of  the forests into the plains.  The great high buildings, whose  towers overlooked the dense woodlands, and whose gigantic clusters  formed large cities, diminished, together with the groves, until  only little log cabins lay snugly in the bosom of the vast prairie.   The cloud shadows which drifted about on the waving yellow of long-dried grasses thrilled me like the meeting of old friends.  

 At a small station, consisting of a single frame house with a  rickety board walk around it, I alighted from the iron horse, just  thirty miles from my mother and my brother Dawee.  A strong hot  wind seemed determined to blow my hat off, and return me to olden  days when I roamed bareheaded over the hills.  After the puffing  engine of my train was gone, I stood on the platform in deep  solitude.  In the distance I saw the gently rolling land leap up  into bare hills.  At their bases a broad gray road was winding  itself round about them until it came by the station.  Among these  hills I rode in a light conveyance, with a trusty driver, whose  unkempt flaxen hair hung shaggy about his ears and his leather neck  of reddish tan.  From accident or decay he had lost one of his long  front teeth.  

 Though I call him a paleface, his cheeks were of a brick red.   His moist blue eyes, blurred and bloodshot, twitched involuntarily.   For a long time he had driven through grass and snow from this  solitary station to the Indian village.  His weather-stained  clothes fitted badly his warped shoulders.  He was stooped, and his  protruding chin, with its tuft of dry flax, nodded as monotonously  as did the head of his faithful beast.  

 All the morning I looked about me, recognizing old familiar  sky lines of rugged bluffs and round-topped hills.  By the roadside  I caught glimpses of various plants whose sweet roots were  delicacies among my people.  When I saw the first cone-shaped  wigwam, I could not help uttering an exclamation which caused my  driver a sudden jump out of his drowsy nodding.  

 At noon, as we drove through the eastern edge of the  reservation, I grew very impatient and restless.  Constantly I  wondered what my mother would say upon seeing her little daughter  grown tall.  I had not written her the day of my arrival, thinking  I would surprise her.  Crossing a ravine thicketed with low shrubs  and plum bushes, we approached a large yellow acre of wild  sunflowers.  Just beyond this nature's garden we drew near to my  mother's cottage.  Close by the log cabin stood a little canvas-covered wigwam.  The driver stopped in front of the open door, and  in a long moment my mother appeared at the threshold.  

 I had expected her to run out to greet me, but she stood  still, all the while staring at the weather-beaten man at my       side.  At length, when her loftiness became unbearable, I  called to her, "Mother, why do you stop?"  

 This seemed to break the evil moment, and she hastened to hold  my head against her cheek.  

 "My daughter, what madness possessed you to bring home such a  fellow?" she asked, pointing at the driver, who was fumbling in his  pockets for change while he held the bill I gave him between his  jagged teeth.  

 "Bring him!  Why, no, mother, he has brought me!  He is a  driver!" I exclaimed.  

 Upon this revelation, my mother threw her arms about me and  apologized for her mistaken inference.  We laughed away the  momentary hurt.  Then she built a brisk fire on the ground in the  tepee, and hung a blackened coffeepot on one of the prongs of a  forked pole which leaned over the flames.  Placing a pan on a heap  of red embers, she baked some unleavened bread.  This light  luncheon she brought into the cabin, and arranged on a table  covered with a checkered oilcloth.  

 My mother had never gone to school, and though she meant  always to give up her own customs for such of the white man's ways  as pleased her, she made only compromises.  Her two windows,  directly opposite each other, she curtained with a pink-flowered  print.  The naked logs were unstained, and rudely carved with the  axe so as to fit into one another.  The sod roof was trying to  boast of tiny sunflowers, the seeds of which had probably been  planted by the constant wind.  As I leaned my head against the  logs, I discovered the peculiar odor that I could not forget.  The  rains had soaked the earth and roof so that the smell of damp clay  was but the natural breath of such a dwelling.  

 "Mother, why is not your house cemented?  Do you have no  interest in a more comfortable shelter?" I asked, when the apparent  inconveniences of her home seemed to suggest indifference on her  part.  

 "You forget, my child, that I am now old, and I do not work  with beads any more.  Your brother Dawee, too, has lost his  position, and we are left without means to buy even a morsel of  food," she replied.  

 Dawee was a government clerk in our reservation when I last  heard from him.  I was surprised upon hearing what my mother said  concerning his lack of employment.  Seeing the puzzled expression  on my face, she continued: "Dawee!  Oh, has he not told you that  the Great Father at Washington sent a white son to take your  brother's pen from him?  Since then Dawee has not been able to make  use of the education the Eastern school has given him."  

 I found no words with which to answer satisfactorily.  I found  no reason with which to cool my inflamed feelings.  

 Dawee was a whole day's journey off on the prairie, and my  mother did not expect him until the next day.  We were silent.  

 When, at length, I raised my head to hear more clearly the  moaning of the wind in the corner logs, I noticed the daylight  streaming into the dingy room through several places where the logs  fitted unevenly.  Turning to my mother, I urged her to tell me more  about Dawee's trouble, but she only said: "Well, my daughter, this  village has been these many winters a refuge for white robbers.   The Indian cannot complain to the Great Father in Washington  without suffering outrage for it here.  Dawee tried to secure  justice for our tribe in a small matter, and to-day you see the  folly of it."  

 Again, though she stopped to hear what I might say, I was  silent.  

 "My child, there is only one source of justice, and I have  been praying steadfastly to the Great Spirit to avenge our wrongs,"  she said, seeing I did not move my lips.    

 My shattered energy was unable to hold longer any faith, and  I cried out desperately: "Mother, don't pray again!  The Great  Spirit does not care if we live or die!  Let us not look for good  or justice: then we shall not be disappointed!"  

 "Sh! my child, do not talk so madly.  There is Taku Iyotan  Wasaka,  [^]:  An absolute Power.

   to which I pray," she answered, as she stroked my head  again as she used to do when I was a smaller child.    

                                  
#  MY MOTHER'S CURSE UPON WHITE SETTLERS.

     One black night mother and I sat alone in the dim starlight,  in front of our wigwam.  We were facing the river, as we talked  about the shrinking limits of the village.  She told me about the  poverty-stricken white settlers, who lived in caves dug in the long  ravines of the high hills across the river.  

 A whole tribe of broad-footed white beggars had rushed hither  to make claims on those wild lands.  Even as she was telling this  I spied a small glimmering light in the bluffs.  

 "That is a white man's lodge where you see the burning fire,"  she said.  Then, a short distance from it, only a little lower than  the first, was another light.  As I became accustomed to the night,  I saw more and more twinkling lights, here and there, scattered all  along the wide black margin of the river.  

 Still looking toward the distant firelight, my mother  continued: "My daughter, beware of the paleface.  It was the cruel  paleface who caused the death of your sister and your uncle, my  brave brother.  It is this same paleface who offers in one palm the  holy papers, and with the other gives a holy baptism of firewater.   He is the hypocrite who reads with one eye, 'Thou shalt not kill,'  and with the other gloats upon the sufferings of the Indian race."   Then suddenly discovering a new fire in the bluffs, she exclaimed,  "Well, well, my daughter, there is the light of another white  rascal!"  

 She sprang to her feet, and, standing firm beside her wigwam,  she sent a curse upon those who sat around the hated white man's  light.  Raising her right arm forcibly into line with her eye, she  threw her whole might into her doubled fist as she shot it  vehemently at the strangers.  Long she held her outstretched  fingers toward the settler's lodge, as if an invisible power passed  from them to the evil at which she aimed.    

                                   
#  RETROSPECTION.

     Leaving my mother, I returned to the school in the East.  As  months passed over me, I slowly comprehended that the large army of  white teachers in Indian schools had a larger missionary creed than  I had suspected.  

 It was one which included self-preservation quite as much as  Indian education.  When I saw an opium-eater holding a position as  teacher of Indians, I did not understand what good was expected,  until a Christian in power replied that this pumpkin-colored  creature had a feeble mother to support.  An inebriate paleface sat  stupid in a doctor's chair, while Indian patients carried their  ailments to untimely graves, because his fair wife was dependent  upon him for her daily food.  

 I find it hard to count that white man a teacher who tortured  an ambitious Indian youth by frequently reminding the brave  changeling that he was nothing but a "government pauper."  

 Though I burned with indignation upon discovering on every  side instances no less shameful than those I have mentioned, there  was no present help.  Even   the few rare ones who have  worked nobly for my race were powerless to choose workmen like  themselves.  To be sure, a man was sent from the Great Father to  inspect Indian schools, but what he saw was usually the students'  sample work *made* for exhibition.  I was nettled by this sly  cunning of the workmen who hoodwinked the Indian's pale Father at  Washington.  

 My illness, which prevented the conclusion of my college  course, together with my mother's stories of the encroaching  frontier settlers, left me in no mood to strain my eyes in  searching for latent good in my white co-workers.  

 At this stage of my own evolution, I was ready to curse men of  small capacity for being the dwarfs their God had made them.  In  the process of my education I had lost all consciousness of the  nature world about me.  Thus, when a hidden rage took me to the  small white-walled prison which I then called my room, I  unknowingly turned away from my one salvation.  

 Alone in my room, I sat like the petrified Indian woman of  whom my mother used to tell me.  I wished my heart's burdens would  turn me to unfeeling stone.  But alive, in my tomb, I was  destitute!  

 For the white man's papers I had given up my faith in the  Great Spirit.  For these same papers I had forgotten the healing in  trees and brooks.  On account of my mother's simple view of life,  and my lack of any, I gave her up, also.  I made no friends among  the race of people I loathed.  Like a slender tree, I had been  uprooted from my mother, nature, and God.  I was shorn of my  branches, which had waved in sympathy and love for home and  friends.  The natural coat of bark which had protected my  oversensitive nature was scraped off to the very quick.  

 Now a cold bare pole I seemed to be, planted in a strange  earth.  Still, I seemed to hope a day would come when my mute  aching head, reared upward to the sky, would flash a zigzag  lightning across the heavens.  With this dream of vent for a long-pent consciousness, I walked again amid the crowds.  

 At last, one weary day in the school-room, a new idea  presented itself to me.  It was a new way of solving the problem of  my inner self.  I liked it.  Thus I resigned my position as  teacher; and now I am in an Eastern city, following the long course  of study I have set for myself.  Now, as I look back upon the  recent past, I see it from a distance, as a whole.  I remember how,  from morning till evening, many specimens of civilized peoples  visited the Indian school.  The city folks with canes and  eyeglasses, the countrymen with sunburnt cheeks and clumsy feet,  forgot their relative social ranks in an ignorant curiosity.  Both  sorts of these Christian palefaces were alike astounded at seeing  the children of savage warriors so docile and industrious.  

 As answers to their shallow inquiries they received the  students' sample work to look upon.  Examining the neatly figured  pages, and gazing upon the Indian girls and boys bending over their  books, the white visitors walked out of the schoolhouse well  satisfied: they were educating the children of the red man!  They  were paying a liberal fee to the government employees in whose able  hands lay the small forest of Indian timber.  

 In this fashion many have passed idly through the Indian  schools during the last decade, afterward to boast of their charity  to the North American Indian.  But few there are who have paused to  question whether real life or long-lasting death lies beneath this  semblance of civilization.
