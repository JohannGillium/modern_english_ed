# GRAND'THER BALDWIN'S THANKSGIVING.

  - Underneath protecting branches, from the highway just aloof, 
- Stands the house of Grand'ther Baldwin, with its gently sloping roof.
  - Square of shape and solid-timbered, it was standing, I have heard, 
- In the days of Whig and Tory, under royal George the Third.
  - Many a time, I well remember, I have gazed with childish awe 
- At the bullet-hole remaining in the sturdy oaken door,
      - Turning round half-apprehensive (recking not how time had fled) 
- Of the lurking savage foeman from whose musket it was sped.
  - Not far off, the barn, plethoric with the autumn's harvest spoils, 
- Holds the farmer's well-earned trophies -the guerdon of his toils;
  - Filled the lofts with hay, sweet-scented, ravished from the meadows green, 
- While beneath are stalled the cattle, with their quiet, drowsy mien.
  - Deep and spacious are the grain-bins, brimming o'er with nature's gold; 
- Here are piles of yellow pumpkins on the barn-floor loosely rolled.
      - Just below in deep recesses, safe from wintry frost and chill, 
- There are heaps of ruddy apples from the orchard on the hill.
  - Many a year has Grand'ther Baldwin in the old house dwelt in peace, 
- As his hair each year grew whiter, he has seen his herds increase.
  - Sturdy sons and comely daughters, growing up from childish plays, 
- One by one have met life's duties, and gone forth their several ways.
  - Hushed the voice of childish laughter, hushed is childhood's merry tone, 
- By the fireside Grand'ther Baldwin and his good wife sit alone.
      - Yet once within the twelvemonth, when the days are short and drear, 
- And chill winds chant the requiem of the slowly fading year,
  - When the autumn work is over, and the harvest gathered in, 
- Once again the old house echoes to a long unwonted din.
  - Logs of hickory blaze and crackle in the fireplace huge and high, 
- Curling wreaths of smoke mount upward to the gray November sky.
  - Ruddy lads and smiling lasses, just let loose from schooldom's cares, 
- Patter, patter, race and clatter, up and down the great hall stairs.
      - All the boys shall hold high revel; all the girls shall have their way,— 
- That's the law at Grand'ther Baldwin's upon each Thanksgiving Day.
  - From the parlor's sacred precincts, hark! a madder uproar yet; 
- Roguish Charlie's playing stage-coach, *and the stage-coach has upset!*
  - Joe, black-eyed and laughter-loving, Grand'ther's specs his nose across, 
- Gravely winks at brother Willie, who is gayly playing horse.
  - Grandma's face is fairly radiant; Grand'ther knows not how to frown, 
- Though the children, in their frolic, turn the old house upside down.
      - For the boys may hold high revel, and the girls must have their way; 
- That's the law at Gran'ther Baldwin's upon each Thanksgiving Day.
  - But the dinner -ah! the dinner -words are feeble to portray 
- What a culinary triumph is achieved Thanksgiving Day!
  - Fairly groans the board with dainties, but the turkey rules the roast, 
- Aldermanic at the outset, at the last a fleshless ghost.
  - Then the richness of the pudding, and the flavor of the pie, 
- When you've dined at Grandma Baldwin's you will know as well as I.
      - When, at length, the feast was ended, Grand'ther Baldwin bent his head, 
- And, amid the solemn silence, with a reverent voice, he said:—
  - "Now unto God, the Gracious One, we thanks and homage pay, 
- Who guardeth us, and guideth us, and loveth us alway!
  - "He scatters blessings in our paths, He giveth us increase, 
- He crowns us with His kindnesses, and granteth us His peace.
  - "Unto himself, our wandering feet, we pray that He may draw, 
- And may we strive, with faithful hearts, to keep His holy law!"
      - His simple words in silence died; a moment's hush, and then 
- From all the listening hearts there rose a solemn-voiced Amen!
