      	   THE SONG OF THE HILLS  BEING THE SONG OF A MAN AND A WOMAN WHO MIGHT HAVE LOVED  *From the Yokut Indian Dialect, Done into English by Mary Austin)*         - THIS is the song of the Hills
 - In the hour when they talk together,
 - When the alpen glow dies down in the west
 - And leaves the heavens tender;
 - In the pure and shadowless hour
 - When the Mountains talk together:
  - "Fir tree leaneth to fir,
 - The wind-blown willows mingle;
 - Clouds draw each to each,
 - Dissolve, depart, and renew one another;
 - But the strong Hills hold asunder.
  - "Had we been less we had loved,
 - We had stooped and been tender;
 - But our hands are under the earth
 - For the travail of her harvests,
 - Upholding the rain-sleeked fields
 - And the long, brown, fruitful furrow.
 - Terror taketh the earth
 - When the Mountains move together.
  - "But ever as winds of Spring
 - Set the meadow grasses caressing,
 - And the coo-dove calls
 - And the coo-dove's mate
 - Resounds in the oak-wood valleys,
 - We shall thrill with the brooding earth,
 - We shall turn, touch hands, and remember,
 - Had we been less, how much we had loved,
 - How nobly we might have been tender."
