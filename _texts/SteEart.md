#                     THE EARTH, THE WORLD AND I.
                    BY CHARLOTTE PERKINS STETSON.

  - "CHILD," said the Earth to me,
 -     "What can you do?
 -      Why do you try?
 - Can you not see
 - That all you are and can ever be
 - Is the product of Heredity—
 -      Merely the outcome, sure and true,
 -      Of other lives gone by?
 - Because your ancestors were such,
 -      Back to primeval slime,
 - Therefore you ail and sin so much,
 -      Therefore 'tis waste of time
 - For you to seek to steer your course
 - Free of this cumulative force.
 - Beast, plant and rock, your story runs
 - Back to the power that swings the suns;
 - And can you disobey the laws
 - That move you from the primal cause?
 - Peace, fretful child!  Be still!
 - And do my will!"
  - "Child," said the World to me,
 -     "What can you do?
 -      Why do you try?
 - Can you not see
 - That all the effort you have spent
 - Is the product of Environment—
 -      That your surroundings govern you,
 -      And circumstances nigh?
 - Because you're born in such an age,
 - Because you're taught from such a page,
 - Because your friends are so and so—
 - Therefore you act and feel and know
 - Just as you do.  In vain you've tried
 - To throw this influence aside.
 - Fruit of your century and race,
 - Your family and dwelling-place,
 - Your education, work and friends—
 - You have no individual ends!
 - Peace, fretful child!  Be still!
 - And do my will!"
    - Said I to the Earth: "Dear Dirt,
 - Your remarks don't hurt,
 - Being peacefully, perfectly true—
 - But the fact of my coming from you
 - Does not alter another, my dear—
 - This fact—I am here!
 - Evolution's long effort to Be
 - Has resulted in me,
 - And I hark with respect to your tones
 - As I would to my bones
 - Should their feelings new utterance give,
 - Should they say, 'We allow you to live!'
 - Heredity?  Yes, I admit
 - All you're claiming for it.
 - The "first cause" is still running your ranch
 - But I'm a collateral branch!
 - In which the same power is set free,
 - To be handled by me.
 - You don't see it?  No matter, old friend,
 - It's all one in the end."
  - Said I to the World: "I can take
 - No offense at the statements you make.
 - They are truthful as far as they go—
 - But there's much you don't know.
 - Your power you correctly define,
 - But you fail to see mine.
 - You make me, in part, it is true—
 - But, my friend, who makes you?
 - The environment's force on our race
 - Is not climate or place
 - So much as each new demonstration
 - Of our social relation.
 - Our strongest impressions we take
 - From conditions we make;
 - And when we don't like the effect
 - We can change—can select;
 - Can unmake and remake and choose
 - The conditions we use!
 - Just think what the product will be
 - When I make you make me!"
