#                      THE REFUGEES BY EDITH WHARTON 
                     ILLUSTRATED BY F. R. GRUGER  

  ON SEPTEMBER 8, 1914, Charley Durand stood helplessly blinking  through his spectacles at the throng of fugitives which the  Folkestone train had just poured out on the platform of Charing  Cross.  

He was aware of a faint haze on the spectacles, which he  usually kept clear of the slightest smirch.  It had been too  prolonged, too abominable, too soul-searching, the slow torture of  his hours of travel with the stricken multitude in which he had  found himself entangled on the pier at Boulogne.  

Charley Durand, professor of Romance languages in a Western  university, had been spending the first weeks of a hard-earned  sabbatical holiday in wandering through Flanders and Belgium, and  on the fatal second of August had found himself at Louvain, whose  university a year or two previously had honored him with a degree.  

He had left Belgium at once, and deeply disturbed by the  dislocation of his plans had carried his shaken nerves to a lost  corner of Normandy, where he had spent the ensuing weeks in trying  to think the war would soon be over.  

It was not that he was naturally hard or aloof about it, or  wanted to be; but the whole business was so contrary to his  conception of the universe and his fagged mind at the moment was so  incapable of prompt readjustment that he needed time to steady  himself.  Besides, his conscience told him that his first duty was  to get back unimpaired to the task which just enabled him to keep  a mother and two sisters above want.  His few remaining francs had  gone to the various relief funds whose appeals penetrated even to  his lost corner; and he therefore decided that the prudent course,  now that everybody said the horror was certainly going to last till  November, would be to slip over to cheap lodgings in London and  bury his nose in the British Museum.  

This decision, as it chanced, had coincided with the  annihilation of Louvain and Malines.  News of the rapid German  advance had not reached him; but at Boulogne he had found himself  caught in the central eddy of fugitives, tossed about among them  like one of themselves, pitched on the boat with them, dealt with  compassionately but firmly by the fagged officials at Folkestone,  jammed into a cranny of the endless train, had chocolate and buns  thrust on him by ministering angels with high heels and powdered  noses, and shyly passed these refreshments on to the fifteen dazed  fellow travelers packed into his compartment.  

His first impulse had been to turn back and fly the sight at  any cost.  But his luggage had already passed out of his keeping,  and he had not the courage to forsake it.  Moreover, a slight  congenital lameness made flight in such circumstances almost  impossible.  So after a fugitive had come down heavily on his lame  foot he resigned himself to keeping in the main current and letting  it sweep him onto the boat.  

Once on board he had hastened to isolate himself behind a  funnel, in an airless corner reeking of oil and steam, while the  refugees, abandoned to unanimous seasickness, became for the time  an indistinguishable animal welter.  But the run to London had  brought him into closer contact with them.  It was impossible to  sit for three mortal hours with an unclaimed little boy on one's  lap, opposite a stony-faced woman holding a baby that never stopped  crying, and not give them something more than what remained of  one's chocolate and buns.  The woman with the child was bad enough;  though perhaps less perversely moving than the little blond thing  with long soiled gloves who kept staring straight ahead and moaning  "My furs!  Oh, my furs!"  But worst of all was the old man at the  other end of the compartment, the motionless old man in a frayed  suit of professorial black, with a face like a sallow bust on a  bracket in a university library.  

It was the face of Durand's own class and of his own  profession, and it struck him as something not to be contemplated  without dire results to his nervous system.  He was glad the old  man did not speak to him, but only waved away with a silent bow the  sandwich he awkwardly offered; and glad that he himself was  protected by a slight [illustration omitted]   stammer, which  agitation always increased, from any attempt at sustained  conversation with the others.  But in spite of these safeguards the  run to London was dreadful.  

On the platform at Charing Cross he stood motionless, trying  to protect his lame leg and yet to take up as little room as  possible, while he waited for the tide to flow by and canalize  itself.  There was no way in which he could help the doomed  wretches; he kept repeating that without its affording him the  least relief.  He had given away his last available penny, keeping  barely enough to pay for a few frugal weeks in certain grimy  lodgings he knew of off Bedford Square; and he could do nothing for  the moment but take up as little space as possible till a break in  the crowd should let him hobble through to freedom.  But that might  not be for another hour; and meanwhile helplessly he gazed at the  scene through misty spectacles.  

The refugees were spread out about him in a stagnant mass,  through which, over which almost, there squeezed, darted, skimmed  and criss-crossed the light battalions of the benevolent.  People  with badges were everywhere, philanthropists of both sexes and all  ages, sorting, directing, exhorting, contradicting, saying "Wee,  wee," and "Oh, no," and "This way, please.  Oh, dear, what is 'this  way' in French?" and "I beg your pardon, but that bed warmer  belongs to my old woman"; and industriously adding, by all the  means known to philanthropy, to the distress and bewilderment of  their victims.  

Durand saw the old professor slip by alone, as if protected by  his silent dignity.  He saw other stricken faces that held  benevolence at bay.  One or two erect old women with smooth hair  and neat black bonnets gave him a sharper pang than the disheveled;  and he watched with positive anguish a mother pausing to straighten  her little boy's collar.  

Suddenly he was aware of a frightened touch on his arm.  

*"Oh, monsieur, je roux en prie, venez!*  Do come!"  

The voice was a reedy pipe, the face that of a little elderly  lady so frail and dry and diaphanous that she reminded him in her  limp, dust-colored garments of a last year's moth shaken out of the  curtains of an empty room.  

*"Je roux en prie!"* she repeated, with a plaintive  stress on the last word.  Her intonation was not exactly French,  but he supposed it was some variety of provincial Belgian, and  wondered why it sounded so unlike anything he had been hearing.   Her face was as wild as anything so small and domesticated could  be.  Tears were running down her thin cheeks, and the hand on his  sleeve twitched in its cotton glove.  *"Mais oui, mais oui*,"  he found himself reassuring her.  Her look of anxiety disappeared,  and as he drew the cotton glove through his arm the tears seemed to  be absorbed into her pale wrinkles.  

"So many of them obviously want to be left alone; here's one  who wants to be looked after," he thought to himself, with a  whimsical satisfaction in the discovery, as he yielded to the  gentle pull on his arm.  

He was of a retiring nature, and compassion, far from making  him expansive, usually contracted his faculties to the point of  cowardice; but the scenes he had traversed were so far beyond any  former vision of human wretchedness that all the defenses of his  gentle egotism had broken down and he found himself suddenly happy  and almost proud at having been singled out as a rescuer.  He  understood the passionate wish of all the rescuers to secure a  refugee and carry him or her away in triumph against all  competitors; and while his agile mind made a rapid sum in division  his grasp tightened on the little old lady's arm and he muttered to  himself: "They shan't take her from me if I have to live on dry  bread!"  

With a victim on his arm—and one who looked the part so  touchingly—it was easier to insinuate his way through the crowd,  and he fended off all the attempts of fair highwaymen to snatch his  prize from him with an energy in which the prize ably seconded him.  

"No, no, no!" she repeated in soft, piping English, tightening  her clutch as he tightened his; and presently he discovered that  she had noticed his lameness, and with her free hand was making  soft fierce dabs at the backs and ribs that blocked their advance.  

"You're lame too.  Did they do it?" she whispered, falling  into French again; and he said chivalrously: "Oh, yes—but it  wasn't their fault."  

"The savages!  I shall never feel in that way about them—  though it's noble of you," she murmured; and the inconsequence of  this ferocity toward her fellow sufferers struck him as rather  refreshingly feminine.  Like most shy men he was dazzled by  unreasonable women.  

"Are you in very great pain?" she continued as they reached  the street.  

"Oh, no—not at all.  I beg you won't—  The trouble is—" he  broke off, confronted by an unforeseen difficulty. [illustration  omitted]  

"What is your trouble?" she sighed, leaning her little head  toward him.  

"Why—I—the fact is I don't know London; or England;  *jamais ete*," he confessed, merging the two languages in a  vain effort at fluency.  

"But of course—why should you?  Only trust me."  

"Ah, you do know it, then?"  

What luck to have found a refugee who could take care of him!   He vowed her half his worldly goods on the spot.  

"She was busy signaling a hansom, and did not answer.  "Is  this all your luggage?"  

A porter had followed with it.  He felt that he ought to have  been asking her for hers, but dared not, fearing a tragic answer.   He supposed she had been able to bring away nothing but her shabby  cloak and the little knobby bag that had been prodding his ribs  ever since they had linked arms.  

"How lucky to have been able to save so much!" she sighed as  his bags and boxes were laboriously hoisted to the hansom.  

"Yes—in such a struggle," he agreed; and wondered if she was  a little flighty as she added: "I suppose you didn't bring your  mattress?  Not that it matters in the very least.  Quick, get in!"  she shrieked out abruptly, pushing him past her into the hansom,  and adding as she scrambled in and snapped the doors shut: "My  sister-in-law—she's so grasping—I don't want her to see us."  

She pushed up the lid and cried out a name unfamiliar to her  companion, but to which horse and driver instantly responded.  

Durand sank back without speaking.  He was bewildered and  disconcerted, and her last words had shocked him.  "My sister-in-law—she's so grasping."  The refugees, then, poor souls, were torn  by the same family jealousies as more prosperous mortals.   Affliction was supposed to soften, but apparently in such monstrous  doses it had the opposite effect.  He had noticed on the journey  symptoms of this reciprocal distrust among the herded creatures.   It was no doubt natural: but he wished his little refugee had not  betrayed the weakness.  

The thought of the sister-in-law they were deserting—perhaps  as helpless and destitute as his own waif—brought a protest to his  stammering tongue.  

"Ought—oughtn't we to take her with us?  Hadn't we better  turn back?"  

"For Caroline?  Oh, no, *non*, no!"  She screamed it in  every tongue.  *"Cher monsieur*, please!  She's sure to have  her own.  Such heaps of them!"  

Ah—it was jealousy then; jealousy of the more favored sister-in-law, who was no doubt younger and handsomer, and had been fought  over by rival rescuers, while she, poor pet, had had to single one  out for herself.  Well, Durand felt he would not have exchanged her  for a beauty—so frail, fluttered, plaintive did she seem, so small  a vessel to contain so great a woe.  

Suddenly it struck him that it was she who had given the order  to the driver.  He was more and more bewildered, and ashamed of his  visible incompetence.  

"Where are we going?" he faltered.  

"For tea—there's plenty of time, I do assure you; and I'm  fainting for a little food."  

"So am I," he admitted; adding to himself: "I'll feed the poor  thing, and then we'll see what's to be done."  

How he wished he hadn't given away all but his last handful of  shillings!  His poverty had never been so humiliating to him.  What  right had he to be pretending to help a refugee?  It was as much as  he could do to pay the hansom and give her her tea.  And then?  A  dampness of fear broke over him, and he cursed his cowardice in not  having told her at once to make another choice.  

"But supposing nobody else had taken her?" he thought,  stealing a look at her small pointed profile and the pale wisps of  hair under her draggled veil.  Her insignificance was complete, and  he decided that he had probably been her last expedient.  

It would be odd if it proved that she was also his.  He  remembered hearing that some of the rich refugees had been able to  bring their money with them, and his mind strayed away to the  whimsical possibility of being offered a post with emoluments by  the frightened creature who was so determined not to let him go.  

"If only I knew London," he thought regretfully, "I might be  worth a good salary to her.  The queer thing is that she seems to  know it herself."  

Both sat silent, absorbed in their emotions.  

It was certainly an odd way to be seeing London for the first  time; but he was glad to be traveling at horse pace instead of  whirling through his thronged sensations in a motor cab.  

"Trafalgar Square—yes.  How clever of you!  *Les Lions de  Milord Nelson!"* she explained.  

They drove on, past palaces and parks.  

*"Maison du Grand Duc.  Arc de triomphe de marbre*," she  successively enlightened him, sounding like a gnat in a megaphone.   He leaned and gazed, forgetting her and himself in an ecstasy of  assimilation.  In the golden autumn haze London loomed mightier and  richer than his best dreams of it.      

                           II    THE hansom stopped and they entered a modest tea room not too  densely crowded.  

"I wanted to get away from that awful mob," she explained,  pushing back her veil as they seated themselves at a table with  red-and-white napkins and a britannia sugar bowl.  

"Crumpets—lots of crumpets and jam," she instructed a  disdainful girl in a butterfly cap, who languished away with the  order to the back of the shop.  

"Durand sat speechless, overwhelmed by his predicament.  Tea  and crumpets were all very well—but afterward, what?  

He felt that his silence was becoming boorish, and leaned  forward over the metal teapot.  At the same instant his protegee  leaned, too, and simultaneously they brought out the question:  

"Where were you when it broke out?"  

"At Louvain," he answered; and she shuddered.  

"Louvain—how terrible!"  

"And you, madame?"  

"I?  At Brussels."  

"How terrible!" he echoed.    

"Yes."  Her eyes filled with tears.  "I had such kind friends  there."  

"Ah, of course.  Naturally."  

She poured the tea and pushed his cup to him.  The haughty  girl reappeared with sodden crumpets, which looked to him like  manna steeped in nectar.  He tossed off his tea as if it had been  champagne, and courage began to flow through his veins.  Never  would he desert the simple creature who had trusted him!  Let no  one tell him that an able-bodied man with brains and education  could not earn enough in a city of this size to support himself and  this poor sparrow.  

The sparrow had emptied her cup, too, and a soft pink suffused  her cheeks, effacing the wrinkles, which had perhaps been only  lines of worry.  He began to wonder if after all she was much more  than forty.  Rather absurd for a man of his age to have been  calling a woman of forty an old lady!  

Suddenly he saw that the sense of security, combined with the  hot tea and the crumpets, was beginning to act on her famished  system like a dangerous intoxicant, and that she was going to tell  him everything—or nearly everything.  She bent forward, her elbows  on the table, the cotton gloves drawn off her thin hands, which  were nervously clenched under her chin.  He noticed a large  sapphire on one of them.  

"I can't tell you—I can't tell you how happy I am!" she  faltered with swimming eyes.  

He remained silent, through sheer embarrassment, and she went  on: "You see, I'd so completely lost hope—so completely.  I  thought no one would ever want me.  They all told me at home that  no one would—my nieces did, and everybody.  They taunted me with  it."  She broke off and glanced at him appealingly.  "You do  understand English, don't you?"  

He assented, still more bewildered, and she went on: "Oh, then  it's so much easier—then we can really talk!  No—our train  doesn't leave for nearly two hours.  You don't mind my talking, do  you?  You'll let me make a clean breast of it?  I must!"  

She touched with a clawlike finger the narrow interval between  her shoulders and added: "For weeks I've been simply suffocating  with longing."  

An uncomfortable redness rose in Charley Durand's forehead.   With these foreign women you could never tell; his brief  Continental experiences had taught him that.  After all, he was not  a monster, and several ladies had already attempted to prove it to  him.  There had been one adventure—on the way home to his hotel at  Louvain, after dining with the curator of prehistoric antiquities—  one adventure of which he could not think even now without feeling  as if he were in a Turkish bath, with no marble slab to cool off  on.  

But this poor lady!  Of course he was mistaken.  He blushed  anew at his mistake.  

"They all laughed at me—jeered at me; Caroline and my nieces  and all of them.  They said it was no use trying—they'd failed,  and how was I going to succeed?  Even Caroline has failed  hitherto—and she's so dreadfully determined.  And of course for a  married woman it's always easier, isn't it?"  

She appealed to him with anxious eyes, and his own sank behind  his protecting spectacles.  Easier for a married woman!  After all,  perhaps he hadn't been mistaken.  He had heard of course that in  the highest society the laxity was even worse.  

"It's true enough"—she seemed to be answering him—"that the  young, good-looking women get everything away from us.  There's  nothing new in that; they always have.  I don't know how they  manage it; but I'm told they were on hand when the very first  boatload of refugees arrived.  I understand the young Duchess of  Bolchester and Lady Ivy Trantham were down at Folkestone with all  the Trantham motors—and from that day to this, though we've all  had our names down on the government list, not one of us—not one  human being at Lingerfield—has had so much as an application from  the committee.  

"And when I couldn't stand it any longer, and said I was going  up to town myself, to wait at the station and seize one of the poor  things before any of those unscrupulous women had got him they said  it was just like me to make a show of myself for nothing.  But,  after all, you see Caroline sneaked off after me without saying  anything, and was making a show of herself too.  And when I saw her  she evidently hadn't succeeded, for she was running about all  alone, looking as wild as she does on sales days at Harrod's.   Caroline is very extravagant, and doesn't mind what she spends; but  she never can make up her mind between bargains, and rushes about  like a madwoman till it's too late.  But oh, how humiliating for  her to go back to the hall without a single refugee!"  

The speaker broke off with a faint laugh of triumph, and wiped  away her tears.  

Charley Durand sat speechless.  The crumpet had fallen from  his fork and his tea was turning gray; but he was unconscious of  such minor misfortunes.  

"I don't—I don't understand," he began; but as he spoke he  perceived that he did.  

It was as clear as daylight; he and his companion had taken  each other for refugees, and she was passionately pressing upon him  the assistance he had been wondering how on earth he should manage  to offer her!  

"Of course you don't, I explain so badly.  They've always told  me that," she answered eagerly.  "Fancy asking you if you'd brought  your mattress, for instance—what you must have thought!  But the  fact is I'd made up my mind you were going to be one of those poor  old women in caps who take snuff and spill things, and who have  always come away with nothing but their beds and a saucepan.  They  all said at Lingerfield: 'If you get even a deaf old woman you're  lucky.'  And so I arranged to give you—I mean her—one of the  rooms in the postmistress' cottage, where I've put an old bedstead  that the vicar's coachman's mother died in, but the mattress had to  be burnt.  Whereas of course you're coming to me—to the cottage,  I mean.  And I haven't even told you where it is or who I am!  Oh,  dear, it's so stupid of me; but you see Kathleen and Agatha and my  sister-in-law all said 'Of course poor Audrey'll never get  anybody'; and I've had the room standing ready for three weeks all  but the mattress—and even the vicar's wife had begun to joke about  it with my brother.  Oh, my brother's Lord Beausedge—didn't I tell  you?"  

She paused, breathless, and then added with embarrassment: "I  don't think I ever made such a long speech in my life."  

He was sure she hadn't, for as she poured out her confession  it had been borne in on him that he was listening  

              *(Continued on Page 53)*  [illustration omitted]    

                      THE REFUGEES  

             *(Continued from Page 5)*  not to a habitual battler but to the uncontrollable outburst of a  shy woman grown inarticulate through want of listeners.  It was  harrowing, the arrears of self-confession that one guessed behind  her torrent of broken phrases.  

"I can't tell you," she began again, as if she had perceived  his sympathy, "the difference it's going to make for me at home—my  bringing the first refugee; and its being—well, someone like you."  

Her blushes deepened, and she lost herself again in the  abasing sense of her inability to explain.  

"Well, my name at any rate," she burst out, "is Audrey  Rushworth; and I'm not married."  

"Neither am I," said her guest, smiling.  

American fashion, he was groping to produce a card.  It would  really not be decent in him to keep up the pretense a moment  longer, and here was an easy way to let her know of her mistake.   He pushed the card toward her, and as he did so his eye fell on it  and he saw, too late, that it was one of those he had rather  fatuously had engraved in French for his Continental travels:    

                     CHARLES DURAND  

             PROFESSEUR DES LANGUES ROMANES  

               A L'UNIVERSITE DE LA SALLE  

      DOCTEUR DE LETTRES DE L'UNIVERSITE DE LOUVAIN    

She scanned the inscription and raised a reverent glance to  him.  *"Monsieur le Professeur?*  I'd no idea!  Though I  suppose I ought to have known at once.  Oh, I do hope," she cried,  "you won't find Lingerfield too unbearably dull!"  She added as if  it were wrung from her: "Some people think my nieces rather  clever."  

The professor of Romance languages sat fascinated by the  consequences of his last blunder.  That card seemed to have been  dealt out by the finger of Fate.  Supposing he went to Lingerfield  with her—just to see what it was like?  

He had always pined to see what an English countryseat was  like; and Lingerfield was apparently important.  He shook off the  mad notion with an effort.  "I'll drive with her to the station,"  he thought, "and just lose myself in the crowd.  That will be the  easiest way of all."  

"There are three of them—Agatha, Kathleen and Clio.  But  you'll find us all hopelessly dull," he heard her repeating.  

"I shall—I certainly shan't—I mean, of course, how could I?"  he stammered.  

It was so much like her own syntax that it appeared to satisfy  her.  

"No—I pay!" she cried, darting between him and the advancing  waitress.  "Shall we walk?  It's only two steps."  And seeing him  looking about for the vanished hansom: "Oh, I sent the luggage on  at once by the cab driver.  You see, there's a good deal of it, and  there's such a hideous rush at the booking office at this hour.   He'll have given it to a porter—so please don't worry!"  

Firm and elastic as a girl, she sprang through the doorway,  while, limping silently at her side, he stared at the decisive fact  that his luggage was once more out of his keeping.      

                           III    CHARLEY DURAND, his shaving glass told him, was forty-five,  decidedly bald, with an awkward limp, scant-lashed blue eyes  blinking behind gold spectacles, a brow that he believed to be  thoughtful and a chin that he knew to be weak.  His height was  medium, his figure sedentary, with the hollows and prominences all  in the wrong places; and he wore ready-made clothes in protective  colors, and square-toed boots with side elastics, and stammered  whenever it was all-important to speak fluently.  

But his Sister Mabel, who knew him better than the others, had  once taken one of his cards and run a pen through the word  "Languages," leaving simply "Professor of Romance"; and in his  secret soul Charley Durand knew that she was right.  

He had in truth a dramatic imagination without the power of  expression.  Instead of writing novels he read them; instead of  living adventures he dreamed them.  Being naturally modest he had  long since discovered his limitations, and decided that all his  imagination would ever do for him was to give him a greater freedom  of judgment than his neighbors had.  Even that was something to be  thankful for; but now he began to ask himself if it was enough.  

Professor Durand had read L'Abbesse de Jouarre and knew that  in moments of extreme social peril superior persons often felt  themselves justified in casting conventional morality to the winds.   He had no thought of proceeding to such extremes; but he did wonder  if, at the hour when civilization was shaken to its base, he,  Charley Durand, might not at last permit himself forty-eight hours  of romance.  

His audacity was fortified by the fact that his luggage was  out of his control, for he could hardly picture any situation more  subversive than that of being separated from his toothbrush and his  reading glasses.  But the difficulty of explaining himself if he  went any farther in the adventure loomed larger as they approached  the station; and as they crossed its crowded threshold, and Miss  Rushworth said "Now we'll see about your things," he saw a fresh  possibility of escape and cried out: "No, no!  Please find places.   I'll look for my luggage."  

He felt on his arm the same inexorable grasp that had steered  him through the labyrinth of Charing Cross.  

"You're quite right.  We'll get our seats first; in such a  crowd it's safer!" she answered gayly, and guided him toward a  second-class compartment.  He had always heard the aristocracy  traveled second class in England.  "Besides," she continued as she  pounced on two window seats, "the baggage is sure to be in the van  already.  Or if it isn't you'd never find it.  All the refugees in  England seem to be traveling by this train!"  

They did indeed—and how tell her that there was one less in  the number than she imagined?  A new difficulty had only just  occurred to him.  It was easy enough to explain to her that she had  been mistaken; but if he did, how justify the hours he had already  spent in her company?  Could he tell the sister of Lord Beausedge  that he had taken her for a refugee?  The statement would seem too  preposterous.  

Desperation nerved him to unconsidered action.  The train was  not leaving yet—there was still time for the confession.  

He scrambled to the seat opposite his captor's and rashly  spoke: "I ought to tell you—I must apologize—apologize abjectly—  for not explaining sooner—"  

Miss Rushworth turned pale, and leaning forward caught his  wrist in her thin claws.  

"Ah, don't go on!" she gasped.  

He lost his last hold on self-possession.  

"Not go on?"  

"Don't you suppose I know?  Didn't you guess that I knew all  along?"  

He paled, too, and then crimsoned, all his old suspicions  rushing back on him.  

"How could I not," she pursued, "when I saw all those heaps of  luggage?  Of course I knew at once you were rich, and didn't  need,"—but her wistful eyes were wet—"need anything I could do  for you.  But you looked so lonely, and your lameness, and the  moral anguish.  I don't see, after all, why we should open our  houses only to pauper refugees; and anyhow it's not my fault, is  it, if the committee simply wouldn't send me any?"  

"But—but—" he desperately began; and then all at once his  stammer caught him, and an endless succession of b's issued from  his helpless throat.  

With exquisite tact Miss Rushworth smiled away his confusion.  

"I won't listen to another word; not one!  Oh, duck your head,  quick!" she shrieked in another voice, flattening herself back into  her corner.  

Durand recognized the same note of terror with which she had  hailed her sister-in-law's approach at Charing Cross.  It was  needless for her to add faintly: "Caroline."  

As she did so a plumed and determined head surged up into the  window frame and an astonished voice exclaimed: "Audrey!"  

A moment later four ladies, a maid laden with parcels and two  bushy Chow dogs had possessed themselves of all that remained of  the compartment; and Durand as he squeezed himself into his corner  was feeling the sudden relief that comes with the cessation of  virtuous effort.  He had seen at a glance that there was nothing  more to be done.  

The young ladies with Lady Beausedge were visibly her  daughters.  They were of graduated heights, beginning with a very  tall one; and were all thin, conspicuous and queerly dressed,  suggesting to the bewildered professor bad copies of originals he  had never seen.  None of them took any notice of him, and the dogs  after smelling his ankles contemptuously followed their example.  

It would indeed have been difficult during the first moments  for any personality less masterful than Lady Beausedge's to assert  itself in her presence.  So prevalent was she that Durand found  himself viewing her daughters, dogs and attendant as her mere  fringes and attributes, and thinking with terror "She's going to  choose the seat next to me," when in reality is was only the  youngest and thinnest of the girls who was settling herself at his  side with a play of parcels as sharp as elbows.  

Lady Beausedge was already assailing her sister-in-law:  

"I'd no idea you meant to run up to town to-day, Audrey.  You  said nothing of it when you dined with us last night."  

Miss Rushworth's eyes fluttered apprehensively from Lady  Beausedge's awful countenance to the timorous face of the professor  of Romance languages, who had bought a newspaper and was deep in  its inner pages.  

"Neither did you, Caroline—" Miss Rushworth began with  unexpected energy; and the thin girl next to Durand laughed.  

"Neither did I what?  What are you laughing at, Clio?"  

"Neither did you say you were coming up to town, mother."  

Lady Beausedge glared, and the other girls giggled.  Even the  maid stooped over the dogs to conceal an appreciative smile.  It  was evident that baiting Lady Beausedge was a popular if dangerous  amusement.  

"As it happens," said the lady of Lingerfield, "the committee  telephoned only this morning."  

Miss Rushworth's eyes brightened.  She grew almost arch.   "Ah—then you came up about refugees?"  

"Naturally."  Lady Beausedge shook out her boa and opened the  Pall Mall Gazette.  

"Such a fight!" groaned the tallest girl, who was also the  largest, vividest and most expensively dressed.  

"Yes; it was hardly worth while.  Anything so grotesquely  mismanaged!"  

The young lady called Clio remarked in a quiet undertone:  "Five people and two dogs to fetch down one old woman with a pipe."  

"Ah, you have got one?" murmured Miss Rushworth, with what  seemed to the absorbed Durand a fiendish simulation of envy.  

"Yes," her sister-in-law grudgingly admitted.  "But, as Clio  says, it's almost an insult to have dragged us all up to town.   They'd promised us a large family, with a prima donna from the  Brussels Opera—so useful for Agatha's music; and two orphans  besides.  I suppose Ivy Trantham got them all, as usual."  She  paused, and added more condescendingly: "After all, Audrey, you  were right not to try to do anything through the committee."  

"Yes; I think one does better without," Miss Rushworth replied  with extreme gentleness.  

"One does better without refugees, you mean?  I dare say we  shall find it so.  I've no doubt the Bidchester set has taken all  but the utterly impossible ones."  

"Not all," said Miss Rushworth.  

Something in her tone caused her nieces to exchange an  astonished glance and Lady Beausedge to rear her head from the Pall  Mall Gazette.  

"Not all," repeated Miss Rushworth.  

The eldest girls broke into an excited laugh.  "Aunt Audrey—  you don't mean you've got an old woman with a pipe too?"  

"No.  Not an old woman."  She paused and waved her hand in  Durand's direction.  *"Monsieur le Professeur Durand, de  l'Universite de Louvain*—my sister-in-law, my nieces.  He  speaks English," she added in a whisper.      

                           IV    CHARLEY DURAND'S window was very low and wide, and quaintly  trellised.  There was no mistaking it, it was a "lattice"—a real  one, with old bluish panes set in sturdy black moldings, not the  stage variety made of plate glass and papier-mache that he had seen  in the sham cottage of aesthetic suburbs at home.  

When he pushed it open a great branch of yellow roses brushed  his face, and a  

          *(Continued on Page 57)*    

             *(Continued from Page 53)*  dewy clematis gazed in at him with purple eyes.  Below lay a  garden, incredibly velvety, flower-filled, and inclosed in yew  hedges so high that it seemed, under the low twilight sky, as  intimate and shut in as Miss Rushworth's low-ceilinged drawing-room, which, in its turn, was as open to the air and as full of  flowers as the garden.  

But all England, that afternoon, as his train traversed it,  had seemed like some great rich garden roofed in from storm and  dust and disorder.  What a wonderful place, and what a miracle to  have been thus carried into the very heart of it!  All his scruples  vanished in the enchantment of this first encounter with the  English country.  

When he had bathed and dressed and descended the black-oak  stairs he found his hostess waiting in the garden.  She was  hatless, with a pale scarf over her head, and a pink spot of  excitement on each withered cheek.  

"I should have preferred a quiet evening here; but since  Caroline made such a point of our dining at the hall—" she began.  

"Of course, of course!  It's all so lovely," said her guest  recklessly.  He would have dined at Windsor Castle with composure.   After the compact and quintessential magic of the cottage nothing  could surprise or overwhelm him.  

They left the garden by a dark-green door in a wall of old  peach-colored brick, and walked in the deepening twilight across a  field and over a stile.  A stile!  He remembered pictures and  ballads about helping girls over stiles, and lowered his eyes  respectfully as Miss Rushworth's hand rested on his in the descent.  

The next moment they were in the spacious shade of a sort of  Forest of Arden, with great groups of bossy trees standing apart,  and deer flashing by at the end of ferny glades.  

"Is it—are we—"  

"Oh, yes.  This is Lingerfield.  The cottage is on the edge of  the park.  It's not a long walk if we go by the chapel and through  the cloisters."  

The very words oppressed him with their too-crowding  suggestions.  There was a chapel in the park—there were cloisters!   Lingerfield had an ecclesiastical past—had been an abbey, no  doubt.  But even such associations paled in the light of the  reality.  As they came out of the shadow of the trees they  recovered a last glow of daylight.  In it lay a gray chapel  delicately laced and pinnacled; and beyond the chapel the arcade of  the cloister, a lawn with one domed cedar, and a gabled Tudor  house, its bricks still rosy in the dusk, and a gleam of sunset  caught in its many-windowed front.  

"How—how long the daylight lasts in England!" said Professor  Durand, choking with emotion.  

The drawing-room into which he had followed Miss Rushworth  seemed full of people and full of silence.  Professor Durand had  never had on a social occasion such an impression of effortless  quiet.  The ladies about the big stone chimney and between the  lamplit tables, if they had not been so discordantly modern in  dress and attitude, might have been a part of the shadowy past.  

Only Lady Beausedge, strongly corseted, many-necklaced, her  boa standing out from her bare shoulders like an Elizabethan ruff,  seemed to Durand majestic enough for her background.  She suggested  a composite image of Bloody Mary and the late Queen.  

He was just recovering from the exchange of silences that had  greeted his entrance when he discovered another figure worthy of  the scene.  It was Lord Beausedge, standing in the window and  glancing disgustedly over the evening paper.  

Lord Beausedge was as much in character as his wife; only he  belonged to a later period.  He suggested stocks and nankeen  trousers, a Lawrence portrait, port wine, fox-hunting, the  Peninsular War, the Indian Mutiny, every Englishman doing his duty,  and resistance to the Reform Bill.  It was portentous that one  person, wearing modern clothes and reading a newspaper, should so  epitomize a vanished age.  

He made a step or two toward his guest, took him for granted,  and returned to the newspaper.  

"Why—why do we all fidget so at home?" Professor Durand  wondered vaguely.  

"Gwen and Ivy are always late," said Lady Beausedge, as though  answering a silence.  

Miss Rushworth looked agitated.  

"Are they coming from Trantham?" she asked.  

"Not him.  Only Gwen and Ivy.  Agatha telephoned, and Gwen  asked if they might."  

After that everyone sat silent again for a long time without  any air of impatience or surprise.  Durand had the feeling that  they all—except perhaps Lord Beausedge—had a great deal to say to  him, but that it would be very slow in coming to the surface.   Well—so much the better; time was no consideration, and he was  glad not to crowd his sensations.  

"Do you know the duchess?" asked Lady Beausedge suddenly.  

"The duchess?"  

"Gwen Rochester.  She's coming.  She wants to see you.  

"To see me?"  

"When Agatha telephoned that you were here she chucked a  dinner somewhere else, and she's rushing over from Trantham with  her sister-in-law.  

Durand looked helplessly at Miss Rushworth and saw that her  cheeks were pink with triumph.  The Duchess of Bolchester was  coming to see her refugee!  

"Do people here just chuck dinners like that?" he asked with  a faint facetiousness.  

"When they want to," said Lady Beausedge simply.  The  conversation again came to a natural end.  

It revived with feverish vivacity on the entrance of two tall  and emaciated young women, who drifted in after Lord Beausedge had  decided to ring for dinner, and who wasted none of their volubility  in excusing their late arrival.  

These apparitions, who had a kind of limp loveliness totally  unknown to the professor of Romance languages, he guessed to be the  Duchess of Bolchester and Lady Ivy Trantham, the most successful  refugee raiders of the district.  They were dressed in pale frail  garments and hung with barbaric beads and bangles, and as soon as  he saw them he understood why he had thought the daughters of the  house looked like bad copies—all except the youngest, whom he was  beginning to single out from her sisters.  

He was not sure whether, during the rapid murmur of talk that  followed, someone breathed his name to the newcomers; but certainly  no one told him which of the two ladies was which; or indeed made  any effort to draw him into the conversation.  It was only when the  slightly less tall addressed the taller one as Gwen that he  remembered this name was that of the duchess.  

She had swept him with a smiling glance of her large, sweet,  vacant eyes, and he had the impression that she, too, had things to  say to him, but that the least strain on her attention was too  great an effort, and that each time she was about to remember who  he was something else distracted her.  

The thought that a duchess had chucked a dinner to see him had  made him slightly giddy; and the humiliation of finding that once  they were confronted she had forgotten what she had come for was  painful even to his disciplined humility.  

But Professor Durand was not without his modest perspicacity,  and little by little he began to guess that this absence of  concentration and insistence was part of a sort of leisurely  holiday spirit unlike anything he had ever known.  Under the low-voiced volubility and restless animation of these young women—whom  the daughters of the house intensely imitated—he felt a great  central inattention.  Their strenuousness was not fatiguing because  it did not insist but blew about like thistledown from topic to  topic.  He saw that his safety lay in this fact, and reassurance  began to steal over him as he understood that the last danger he  was exposed to was that of being too closely interrogated.  

"If I'm an impostor," he thought, "at least no one here will  find it out."  

And then just as he had drawn this sage conclusion, he felt  the sudden pounce of the duchess' eye.  Dinner was over and the  party had regrouped itself in a great book-paneled room, before the  carved chimney piece of which she stood lighting her cigarette like  a duchess on the cover of a novel.  

"You know I'm going to carry you off presently," she said  gayly.  

Miss Audrey Rushworth was sitting in a sofa corner beside her  youngest niece, whom she evidently found less intimidating than the  others.  Durand instinctively glancing toward them saw the elder  lady turn pale, while Miss Clio Rushworth's swinging foot seemed to  twinkle with malice.  

He bowed as he supposed one ought to bow when addressed by a  duchess.  

"Off for a talk?" he hazarded playfully.  

"Off to Trantham.  Didn't they tell you?  I'm giving a big  garden party for the Refugee Relief Fund, and I'm looking for  somebody to give us a lecture on Atrocities.  That's what I came  for," she added ingenuously.  

There was a profound silence, which Lord Beausedge, lifting  his head from the Times, suddenly broke.  

"Damn bad taste, all that sort of thing," he remarked, and  continued his reading.  

"But Gwen, dear," Miss Rushworth faltered, "your garden party  isn't till the nineteenth."  

The duchess looked surprised.  She evidently had no head for  dates.  

"Isn't it, Aunt Audrey?  Well, it doesn't matter, does it?  I  want him all the same.  We want him awfully, Ivy, don't we?"  She  shone on Durand.  "You'll see such lots of your own people at  Trantham.  The Belgian Minister and the French Ambassador are  coming down for the lecture.  You'll feel less lonely there."  

Lady Beausedge intervened with authority: "I think I have a  prior claim, my dear Gwen.  Of course Audrey was not expecting  anyone—anyone like Professor Durand; and at the cottage he might—  he might—but here, with your uncle, and the girls all speaking  French—"  She turned to Durand with a hospitable smile.  

"Your room's quite ready; and of course my husband will be  delighted if you like to use the library to prepare your lecture  in.  We'll send the governess cart for your traps to-morrow."  She  fixed her firm eyes on the duchess.  "You see, dear, it was all  quite settled."  

Lady Ivy Trantham spoke up: "It is not a bit of use, Aunt  Carrie.  Gwen can't give him up."  Being apparently unable to  master the professor's name the sisters-in-law continued to  designate him by the personal pronoun.  "The committee has given us  a prima donna from the Brussels Opera to sing the Marseillaise and  the what-ye-may-call-it Belgian anthem, but there are lots of  people coming just for the Atrocities."  

"Oh, we must have the Atrocities!" the duchess echoed.  She  looked musingly at Durand's pink, troubled face.  "He'll do them  awfully well," she concluded, talking about him as if he were deaf.  

"We must have somebody who's accustomed to lecturing.  People  won't put up with amateurs," Lady Ivy reenforced her.  

Lady Beausedge's countenance was dark with rage.  

"A prima donna from the Brussels Opera!  But the committee  telephoned me this morning to come up and meet a prima donna!  It's  all a mistake her being at Trantham, Gwen!"  

"Well," said the duchess serenely.  "I dare say it's all a  mistake his being here."  She looked more and more tenderly on the  professor.  

"But he's not here: he's with me at the cottage!" cried Miss  Rushworth, springing up with sudden resolution.  "It's too absurd  and undignified, this—this squabbling."  

"Yes; don't let's squabble.  Come along," said the duchess,  slipping her long arm through Durand's as Miss Rushworth's had been  slipped through it at Charing Cross.  

The subject of this flattering but agitating discussion had  been struggling ever since it began, with a nervous contraction of  the throat.  When at length his lips opened only a torrent of  consonants rushed from them, finally followed by the cryptic  monosyllables: "I'm not!"  

"Not a professional?  Oh, but you're a professor—that'll do!"  cried Lady Ivy Trantham briskly, while the duchess, hugging his arm  closer, added in a voice of persuasion: "You see, we've got one at  Trantham already, and we're so awfully afraid of him that we want  you to come and talk to him.  You must."  

"I mean, n-n-not a r-r-ref—" gasped out the desperate Durand.  

Suddenly he felt his other arm caught by Miss Clio Rushworth,  who gave it a deep and eloquent pinch.  At the same time their eyes  met, and he read in hers entreaty, command and the passionate  injunction to follow her lead.  

"Poor Professor Durand—you'll take us for red Indians on the  war trail!  Come to the dining room with me and I'll give you a  glass of champagne.  I saw the curry was too strong for you," this  young lady insinuatingly declared.  

Durand with one of his rare flashes of self-possession had  converted his stammer into a strangling cough, and released by the  duchess made haste to follow his rescuer out of the room.  He kept  up his racking cough while they crossed the hall, and by the time  they reached the dining room tears of congestion were running down  behind his spectacles, and he sank into a chair and rested his  elbows despairingly on a corner of the great mahogany table.  

Miss Clio Rushworth disappeared behind a tall screen and  returned with a glass of champagne.  "Anything in it?" she inquired  pleasantly, and smiled at his doleful gesture of negation.  

He emptied his glass and cleared his throat; but before he  could speak she held up a silencing hand.  

"Don't—don't!" she said.  

He was startled by this odd echo of her aunt's entreaty, and  a little tired of being hurled from one cryptic injunction to  another.  

"Don't what?" he questioned sharply.  

"Make a clean breast of it.  Not yet.  Pretend you are, just  a little longer, please."  

"Pretend I am—"  

"A refugee."  She sat down opposite him, her sharp chin  supported on crossed hands.  "I'll tell you why."  

But Professor Durand was not listening.  A momentary rapture  of relief at being found out had been succeeded by a sick dread of  the consequences.  He tried to read the girl's thin ironic face,  but her eyes and smile were inscrutable.  

"Miss Rushworth, at least let me tell you—"  

She shook her head kindly but firmly.  "That you're not a  German spy in disguise?  Bless you, don't you suppose I can guess  what's happened?  I saw it the moment we got into the railway  carriage.  I suppose you came over from Boulogne in the refugee  train, and when poor dear Aunt Audrey pounced on you you began to  stammer and couldn't explain."  

Oh, the blessed balm of her understanding!  He drew a deep  breath of gratitude, and faltered, smiling back at her smile: "It  was worse than that.  Much worse.  I took her for a refugee too.   We rescued each other!"  

A peal of youthful mirth shook the mighty rafters of the  Lingerfield dining room.  Miss Clio Rushworth buried her face and  sobbed.  

"Oh, I see—I see—I see it all!"  

"No you don't—not quite—not yet!" he gurgled back at her.  

"Tell me then; tell me everything!"  

And he told her; told her quietly, succinctly and without a  stammer, because under her cool kindly gaze he felt himself at last  in an atmosphere of boundless comprehension.  

"You see, the adventure fascinated me; I won't deny that," he  ended, laying bare the last fold of his duplicity.  

This, for the first time, seemed to stagger her.  

"The adventure—an adventure with Aunt Audrey?"  

They smiled at each other a little.  "I meant, the adventure  of England—I've never been in England before—and of a baronial  hall.  It is baronial?  In short, of just exactly what's been  happening to me.  The novelty, you see—but how should you see?—  was irresistible.  The novelty, and all the old historic  associations.  England's in our blood, after all."  He looked about  him at the big, dusky, tapestried room.  "Fancy having seen this  kind of thing only on the stage!  Yes, I was drawn on by  everything—by everything I saw and heard from the moment I set  foot in London.  Of course if I hadn't been I should have found an  opportunity of explaining; or I could have bolted away from her at  the station."  

"I'm so glad you didn't.  That's what I'm coming to," said the  girl.  "You see, it's been—how shall I explain?—more than an  adventure for Aunt Audrey.  It's literally the first thing that's  ever happened to her."  

Professor Durand blushed to the roots of his hair.  

"I don't understand," he said feebly.  

"No.  Of course not.  Any more, I suppose, than I really  understand what Lingerfield represents to an American.  And you  would have had to live at Lingerfield for generations and  generations to understand Aunt Audrey.  You see, nothing much ever  happened to the unmarried women of her time.  Most of them were  just  

          *(Concluded on Page 61)*    

             *(Concluded from Page 57)*  put away in cottages covered with clematis and forgotten.  Aunt  Audrey has always been forgotten—even the refugee committee forgot  her.  And my father and mother, and her other brothers and sisters,  and my sisters and I—I'm afraid we've always forgotten her too."  

"Not you," said Professor Durand with sudden temerity.  

Miss Clio Rushworth smiled.  "I'm very fond of her: and then  I've been a little bit forgotten myself."  She paused a moment and  continued: "All this would take too long to explain.  But what I  want to beg of you is this—let her have her adventure, give her  her innings, keep up the pretense a little longer.  None of the  others have guessed, and I promise to get you away safely before  they do.  Just let Aunt Audrey have her refugee for a bit, and  triumph over Lingerfield and Trantham. . . .  The duchess?  Oh,  I'll arrange that too.  Slip back to the cottage now—this way,  across the lawn, by the chapel—and I'll say your cough was so  troublesome that you rushed back to put on a mustard plaster.  I'll  tell Gwen you'll be delighted to give the lecture—"  

Durand raised his hands in protest but she went on gayly:  "Why, don't you see that the more you hold out the more she'll want  you?  Whereas if you accept at once and even let her think you're  going over to stop at Trantham as soon as your cough is better  she'll forget she's ever asked you. . . .  Insincere, you say?   Yes, of course; a little.  But have you considered what would have  happened if you hadn't choked just now and had succeeded in  shouting out that you were an impostor?"  

A cold chill ran down Charley Durand's spine as his masterful  adviser set forth this forgotten aspect of the case.  

"Yes—I do see.  I see it's for the best."  

"Well—rather!"  She pushed him toward a window opening on the  lawn.  "Be off now—and do play up, won't you?  I'll promise to  stick by you and see you out of it if only you'll do as I ask."  

Their hands met in a merry grasp of complicity, and as he fled  away through the moonlight he carried with him the vision of her  ugly vivid face and wondered how such a girl could ever think she  could be forgotten.      

                            V    A GOOD many things had happened before he stood again on the pier  at Boulogne.  

It was in April, 1918, and he was buttoned into a too-tight  uniform, on which he secretly hoped the Y. M. C. A. initials were  not always the first things to strike the eye of the admiring  spectator.  

It was not that he was ungrateful to the great organization  which had found a task for him in its ranks; but that he could  never quite console himself for the accident of having been born a  few years too soon to be wearing the real uniform of his country.   That would indeed have been romance beyond his dreams; but he had  long ago discovered that he was never to get beyond the second-best  in such matters.  None of his adventures would ever be written with  a capital.  

Still, he was very content; and never more so than now that he  was actually in France again, in touch and in sound of the mighty  struggle that had once been more than his nerves could bear, but  that they could bear now with perfect serenity because he and his  country, for all they were individually worth, had a stake in the  affair and were no longer mere sentimental spectators.  

The scene, novel as it was because of the throngs of English  and American troops that animated it, was still in some of its  details pathetically familiar.  For the German advance in the north  had set in movement the native populations of that region, and  among the fugitives some forlorn groups had reached Boulogne and  were gathered on the pier, much as he had seen them four years  earlier.  Only in this case they were in dozens instead of  hundreds, and the sight of them was harrowing more because of what  they symbolized than from their actual numbers.  

Professor Durand was no more in quest of refugees than he had  been formerly.  He had been dispatched to Boulogne to look after  the library of a Y. M. C. A. canteen, and was standing on the pier  looking vaguely about him for a guide with the familiar initials on  his collar.  

In the general confusion, he could discover no one who took  the least interest in his problem, and he was waiting resignedly in  the sheltered angle formed by two stacks of packing cases when he  suddenly remembered that he had always known the face he was  looking at was not one to forget.  

It was that of a dark thin girl in khaki, with a slouch hat  and leggings, and her own unintelligible initials on her shoulder,  who was giving firm directions to a large orderly in a British Army  motor.  

As Durand looked at her she looked at him.  Their eyes met,  and she burst out laughing.  

"Well, you do have the queerest-looking tunics in your army!"  she exclaimed as their hands clasped.  

"I know we do—and I'm too fat.  But you knew me?" the  professor cried triumphantly.  

"Why, of course!  I should know your spectacles anywhere,"  said Miss Clio Rushworth gayly.  She finished what she was saying  to the orderly, and then came back to the professor.  

"What a lark!  What are you?  Oh, Y. M. C. A., of course.   With the British, I suppose?"  They perched on the boxes and  exchanged confidences, while Durand inwardly hoped that the man who  ought to be looking for him was otherwise engaged.  

Apparently he was, for their talk continued to ramble on  through a happy labyrinth of reminiscences spangled with laughter.  

"And when they found out—weren't they too awfully horrified?"  he asked at last, blushing at the mere remembrance.  

She shook her head with a smile.  "They never did—nobody  found out but father, and he laughed for a week.  I wouldn't have  had anyone else know for the world.  It would have spoiled all Aunt  Audrey's fun if Lingerfield had known you weren't a refugee.  To  this day you're her great adventure."  

"But how did you manage it?  I don't see yet."  

"Come round to our canteen to-night and I'll tell you."  

She stood up and shoved her cigarette case into the pocket of  the tunic that fitted so much better than his.  

"I tell you what—as your man hasn't turned up come over to  the canteen now and see Aunt Audrey."  

Professor Durand paled in an unmartial manner.  

"Oh, is Miss Rushworth here?"  

"Rather!  She's my chief.  Come along."  

"Your chief?  He wavered again, his heart failing him.  

"Really—won't it be better for me not to?  Suppose—suppose  she should remember me?"  

Miss Rushworth's niece laughed.  "I don't believe she will,  she's so blind.  Besides, what if she did?  She's seen a good many  refugees since your day.  You see, they've become rather a drug on  the market, poor dears.  And Aunt Audrey's got her head full of  other things now."  

She had started off at her long swift stride, and he was  hurrying obediently after her.  

The big brown canteen was crowded with soldiers who were being  variously refreshed by young ladies in trig khaki.  At the other  end of the main room Miss Clio Rushworth turned a corner and  entered an office.  Durand followed her.  

At the office desk sat a lady with eye-glasses on a sharp  nose.  She wore a colonel's uniform, with several decorations, and  was bending over the desk busily writing.  

A young girl in a nurse's dress stood beside her, as if  waiting for an order, and flattened against the wall of the room  sat a row of limp, disheveled, desolate beings—too evidently  refugees.  

The colonel lifted her head quickly and glanced at her niece  with a resolute and almost forbidding eye.  

"Not another refugee, Clio—not one!  I absolutely refuse.   We've not a hole left to put them in, and the last family you sent  me went off with my mackintosh and my electric lamp."  

She bent again sternly to her writing.  As she looked up her  glance strayed carelessly over Professor Durand's congested  countenance, and then dropped to the desk without a sign of  recognition.  

"Oh, Aunt Audrey—not one, not just one?" the colonel's niece  pleaded.  

"It's no use, my dear.  Now don't interrupt, please. . . .   Here are the bulletins, nurse."  

Colonel Audrey Rushworth shut her lips with a snap and her pen  drove on steadily over the sheets of official letter paper.    

When Professor Durand and Clio Rushworth stood outside of the  canteen again in the spring sunshine they looked long at each other  without speaking.  

Charley Durand, under his momentary sense of relief, was aware  of a distinct humiliation.  

"I see I needn't have been afraid!" he said, forcing an  artificial laugh.  

"I told you so.  The fact is, Aunt Audrey has a lot of other  things to think about nowadays.  There's no danger of her being  forgotten—it's she who does the forgetting now."  She laid a  commiserating hand on his arm.  "I'm sorry—but you must excuse  her.  She's just been promoted again and she's going to marry the  Bishop of the Kamerun next month."
