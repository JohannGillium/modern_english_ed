#   KUMASAKA
  By ZENCHIKU UJINOBU (1414-1499?)  

        - A Priest from the Capital
  - A Priest of Amasaka (really the ghost of the robber Kumasaka  No Chonan)
 - Chorus
         Priest:     - These weary feet that found the World
  - Too sad to walk in, whither
  - Oh whither shall wandering lead them?
         I am a priest from the Capital. I have never seen the East country, and  now I am minded to go there on pilgrimage.  

    *  He describes the journey, walking slowly round the stage.  *       - Over the mountains, down the Ōmi road by a foam-flecked  stream;
  - And through the woods of Awazu.
  - Over the long bridge of Seta
  - Heavily my footfall clangs.
  - In the bamboo-woods of Noji I await the dawn.
  - There where the morning dew lies thick, over the Greenfield Plain,
  - Green in name only   —   for the leaves are red with autumn   —   
  - In evening sunshine to the village of Akasaka I am come!
           Kumasaka:     *  It is convenient to call him this, but he is the ghost of Kumasaka,  appearing in the guise of a priest.  *      Hey, you priest, I have something to say to you!  

         Priest:     What is it you would say to me?  

              Kumasaka:     To-day is some one's birthday. I beg of you to pray for the salvation of  his soul.  

        Priest:     I have left the World, and it is my business now to say such prayers; but  of whom am I to think when I pray?  

         Kumasaka:     There is no need to know his name. He is buried in that tomb over there,  among the rushes to this side of the pine tree. It is because he cannot  get free  [^n61.1]   that he needs your prayers.  

         Priest:     No, no; it will not do. I cannot pray for him unless I know his name.  

         Kumasaka:     Pray, none the less. For it is written, "All the creatures of the world  shall be profited.  

    There shall be no distinction."  

         Priest:     From dying and being born.  

         Kumasaka:     Deliver him, oh deliver him!  

         Chorus:     - For he that taketh a prayer unto himself
  - Even though his name be not named, if he receive it gladly,
  - Is the owner of the prayer.
  - Was not the promise made to the trees of the field,
  - To the soil of the land? Though the heart that prays marks no name upon  the prayer,
  - Yet shall it be heard.
           Kumasaka:     Then come back to my cottage with me and pass the night there.  

              Priest:     I will come.  

    *  They go into the cottage, which is represented by a wicker framework at  the front.  *      Listen! I thought you were taking me to where there would be a chapel, so  that I could begin my prayers. But here I can see no painted picture nor  carven image that I could put up. There is nothing on the wall but a great  pike,   —   no handstaff, but only an iron crowbar; and other weapons of  war are nailed up. What is the reason of this?  

         Kumasaka:     You must know that when I first took the vows of priesthood I went round  from village to village here, to Tarui, Auhaka and Akasaka   —   there is  no end to them, but I know all the roads,   —   through the tall grass at  Aono and the thick woods of Koyasu, night or day, rain or fine. For I was  a hill-bandit in those days, a thief of the night, tilting baggage from  mules' backs; even stripping servant-girls of their clothes, as they went  from farm to farm, and leaving them sobbing.  

      Then it was that I used to take with me that pike there and waving it in  their faces, "Stand and deliver!" I would cry.  

      But at last a time came when it was not so.  [^n62.1]   And after that time I was glad enough to find shelter even in such a  place as this. I yielded my will and was content. For at last I had indeed  resolved to leave the hateful World.  

       Oh petty prowess of those days!  

          Chorus:     - For hand of priest unfit indeed
  - Such deeds and weapons had I thought;
  - Yet among gods
  - Hath not the Lord Amida his sharp sword?
  - Doth not the King of Love  [^n62.2]
  - Shoot arrows of salvation from his bow?
  - Tamon with tilted lance
  - Outbattled demons and hath swept away
  - All perils from the world.
                Kumasaka:     - Thoughts of love and pity
  - May be sins fouler
           Chorus:     - Than the Five Faults of Datta;  [^n63.1]
  - And the taking of life for faith
  - Be holiness greater
  - Than the six virtues of Bosatsu.  [^n63.2]
  - These things have I seen and heard.
  - But for the rest, is it not Thought alone
  - That either wanders in the trackless night
  - Of Error or awakes to the wide day?
  - "Master thy thoughts, or they will master thee,"
  - An ancient proverb  [^n63.3]   says.
      *  Speaking for Kumasaka.  *      "But I must have done, or dawn will find me talking still. Go to your  rest, Sir; and I too will doze awhile." So he spoke, and seemed to go into  the bedroom. But suddenly the cottage vanished: nothing was left but the  tall grass. It was under the shadow of a pine-tree that he  [^n63.4]   had rested!  

      *  There is usually an interlude to occupy the time while Kumasaka is  changing his costume. An inhabitant of Akasaka tells stories of Kumasaka's  exploits.  *       Priest:     I have seen strange things. I cannot sleep, no, not even for a while as  little as the space between the antlers of a young stag. Under this  autumn-winded pine-tree lying, all night long I will perform a service of  chanted prayer.  [^n63.5]  

        Kumasaka:   *  Reappearing with a scarf tied round his head and a long pike over his  shoulder.  *           The wind is rising in the south-east. The clouds of the north-west are  shifting; it is a dark night. A wild wind is sweeping the woods under the  hill.  

         Chorus:     See how the branches are heaving.  

         Kumasaka:     The moon does not rise till dawn to-night; and even when she rises she  will be covered.  

    Send along the order for an assault!  

    *  Recollecting himself.  *      The whole heart divided between bow-hand and rein-hand,   —   oh the sin  of it! For ever seizing another's treasure! Look, look on my misery, how  my heart clings to the World!  

         Priest:     If you are Kumasaka himself, tell me the story of those days.  

         Kumasaka:     There was a merchant, a trafficker in gold, called Kichiji of the Third  Ward. Each year he brought together a great store, and loading it in bales  carried it up-country. And thinking to waylay him I summoned divers trusty  men. . . .  

         Priest:     Tell me the names of those that were chosen by you and the countries they  came from.  

         Kumasaka:     There was Kakujō of Kawachi,   and the brothers Surihari that had no  rivals in fencing.  

         Priest:     Well, and from within the City itself among many there were   —     

         Kumasaka:     There was Emon of the Third Ward and Kozaru of Mibu.  

              Priest:     Skilful torch-throwers, in broken-attack  

         Kumasaka:     Their like will never be seen.  

         Priest:     And from the North country, from Echizen  

         Kumasaka:     There was Matsuwaka of Asau and Kurō of Mikuni.  

         Priest:     And from the country of Kaga, from Kumasaka  

         Kumasaka:     There was this Chōhan, the first of them, a great hand at deeds of  villainy; and with him seventy men of the band.  

         Priest:     On all the roads where Kichiji might be passing, up hill and down dale on  every halting-place they spied, till at last  

         Kumasaka:     Here at the Inn of Akasaka we found him,   —   a fine place, with many  roads leading from it. We set watch upon the place. The merchants had sent  for women. From nightfall they feasted. They roystered the hours  away   —     

         Priest:     - And at last, very late at night,
  - Kichiji and his brother, with no thought for safety,
  - Fell into a sodden sleep.
           Kumasaka:     - But there was with them a boy of sixteen.  [^n65.1]
  - He put his bright eye to a hole in the wall.
  - He did not make the least noise.
                Priest:     - He did not sleep a wink.
           Kumasaka:     - Ushiwaka! We did not know he was there.
           Priest:     - Then the robbers, whose luck was run out,
           Kumasaka:     - Thinking that the hour of fortune was come,
          Priest:     - Waited impatiently.
          Chorus:     - Oh how long it seemed till at last the order came.
            Kumasaka:     - Dash in!
           Chorus:     - And, hurling their firebrands,
  - In they rushed, each jostling to be first,
  - More of them and more, in a wild onslaught.
  - Not even the God of Peril had dared to face them.
  - But little Ushiwaka showed no fear.
  - He drew his belt-sword and met them.
  - The Lion Pounce, The Tiger Leap, The Bird Pounce . . .  [^n66.1]
  - He parried them all. They thrust at him but could not prevail.
  - Thirteen there were who attacked him;
  - And now, done to death, on the same pillow head to head they lie.
  - And others, wounded, have flung down their swords and slunk back  weaponless,
  - Stripped of all else but life.
  - Then Kumasaka cried: "What demon or god can he be
  - Under whose hand all these have fallen? For a man he cannot be!
  - But even robbers need their lives! This is no work for me; I will  withdraw."
  - And slinging his pike, slowly he turned to go.
                Kumasaka:     - I was thinking.
           Chorus:     - He was thinking as he went,
  - "Though this stripling slash so bravely,
  - Yet should Kumasaka employ his secret art,—
  - Then though the boy be ogre or hobgoblin,
  - Waist-strangled he would be pressed to dust."
  - "I will avenge the fallen," he cried, and, turning back,
  - He levelled his pike and sheltered behind the wattled door,
  - Waiting for the urchin to come.
  - Ushiwaka saw him, and drawing his sword held it close to his side,
  - Stood apart and watched. But Kumasaka too stood with his pike  ready.
  - Each was waiting for the other to spring.
  - Then Kumasaka lost patience. He lunged with his left foot and with his  pike
  - Struck a blow that would have pierced an iron wall.
  - But Ushiwaka parried it lightly and sprang to the left.
  - Kumasaka was after him in a moment, and as he sprang nimbly over the  pike  [^n67.1]
  - Turned the point towards him.
  - But as he drew back the pike, Ushiwaka crossed to the right.
  - Then levelling the pike, Kumasaka struck a great blow.
  - This time the boy parried it with a blow that disengaged them,
  - And springing into the air leapt hither and thither with invisible  speed.
  - And while the robber sought him,
  - The wonderful boy pranced behind and stuck his sword through a chink in  his coat of mail.
  - "Hey, what is that?" cried Kumasaka. "Has this urchin touched me?"
  - And he was very angry.
  - But soon Heaven's fatal ordinance was sealed by despair:
   - "This sword-play brings me no advantage," he cried; "I will wrestle  with him."
  - Then he threw away his pike, and spreading out his great hands,
         - Down this corridor and into this corner he chased him, but when he  would have grasped him,
  - Like lightning, mist, moonlight on the water,   —   
  - The eye could see, but the hand could not touch.
           Kumasaka:     - I was wounded again and again.
           Chorus:     He was wounded many times, till the fierce strength of his spirit weakened  and weakened. Like dew upon the moss that grows.  

         Kumasaka:     - Round the foot of this pine-tree
           Chorus:     - Are vanished the men of this old tale.
  - "Oh, help me to be born to happiness."
      *  Kumasaka entreats the Priest with folded hands.  *      - The cocks are crowing. A whiteness glimmers over the night.
  - He has hidden under the shadow of the pine-trees of Akasaka;
      *  Kumasaka hides his face with his left sleeve.  *      - Under the shadow of the pine-trees he has hidden himself away.
