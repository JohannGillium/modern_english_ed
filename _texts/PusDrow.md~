# THE DROWNED MAN.[^n1]
BY ALEXANDER PUSHKIN.

- HOME the children hasten, crying
- To their father at the door:
- *"Tiatia!*[^n2]here's a dead man, lying
- In our nets upon the shore."
- "Dead man? Nonsense!" father answers.
- "Why will children babble so?
- Get you gone, you young romancers
- No more tales, I warn you. Go!
- "If such secrets I discover,
- Then the court will question me
- Such a trial's never over;
- Yet,my coat, wife. I must see.
- "Where, then, is the corpse?" "Here, father."
- Where the dripping nets are spread,
- In a silent group they gather,
- Gazing on the unknown dead.
- 'Tis a sight to make them tremble,
- That cold face of ghastly hue;
- Naught of life does it resemble,
- With its parted lips of blue.
- Was it one whom sin had saddened?
- Some lost fisher of the main?
- One whom drink had dulled or maddened?
- Some rich merchant, robbed and slain?
- Little knowing, little caring,
- Quick the moujik glances round,
- Seizes then the body, bearing
- To the tide again its drowned.
- To the swiftest current guided,
- Pushed from that unwilling shore,
- Grave and cross still unprovided,
- Swims the wandering dead once more.
- Wilder waters reached, and deeper,
- On the waves the body lay,
- Tossing like a troubled sleeper,
- As the moujik turned away.
- Full of storms the night descended.
- Mother, children, calmly slept;
- But the father, unattended
- By repose, long vigil kept.
- Then he heard the casement shaking
- "Who dares ask for shelter here,
- At my window, all awaking?"
- And he opened, half in fear.
- Through the rifted black clouds slipping,
- Shone the moon; there, in its beams,
- Stood the drowned man, wide-eyed, dripping
- Down his beard ran little streams.
- As one threatens, or beseeches,
- So his two arms forth he flung.
- Shell-fish black, and loathsome leeches,
- Round his swollen body hung.
- Quick the peasant slammed the shutter,
- As he recognized his guest,
- "May you burst!" he tried to mutter,
- Then lay downbut not to rest.
- All night long he saw it plainly,
- That dread specter, stern as fate
- Heard the drowned man rapping vainly
- At the window or the gate.
- Now in whispers 'tis related,
- How one night in every year
- Sees that peasant, evil-fated,
- Haunted with a ghostly fear;
- How the wildest winds are rocking
- Ever on that fatal date,
- As the drowned man still stands knocking
- At the window and the gate.
[^n1]:1.Among the Russian peasantry it is regarded as the sacred duty of any one finding a dead human body to give it a Christian burial, and to erect a cross over the grave. According to the popular superstition, neglect of this duty is invariably followed by some mysterious and fearful punishment.

[^n2]:2.Papa.
