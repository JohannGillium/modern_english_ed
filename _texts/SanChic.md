# CHICAGO POEMS

 
    
## CHICAGO

  - HOG Butcher for the World,
 - Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat,
 - Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler;
 - Stormy, husky, brawling,
 - City of the Big Shoulders:
   - They tell me you are wicked and I believe them, for I
 - have seen your painted women under the gas lamps
 - luring the farm boys.
 - And they tell me you are crooked and I answer: Yes, it
 - is true I have seen the gunman kill and go free to
 - kill again.
 - And they tell me you are brutal and my reply is: On the
 - faces of women and children I have seen the marks
 - of wanton hunger.
 - And having answered so I turn once more to those who
 - sneer at this my city, and I give them back the sneer
 - and say to them:
 - Come and show me another city with lifted head singing
 - so proud to be alive and coarse and strong and cunning.
 - Flinging magnetic curses amid the toil of piling job on
 - job, here is a tall bold slugger set vivid against the
 - little soft cities;
  - Fierce as a dog with tongue lapping for action, cunning
 - as a savage pitted against the wilderness,
 -      Bareheaded,
 -      Shoveling,
 -      Wrecking,
 -      Planning,
 -      Building, breaking, rebuilding,
 - Under the smoke, dust all over his mouth, laughing with
 - white teeth,
 - Under the terrible burden of destiny laughing as a young
 - man laughs,
 - Laughing even as an ignorant fighter laughs who has
 - never lost a battle,
 - Bragging and laughing that under his wrist is the pulse.
 - and under his ribs the heart of the people,
 -           Laughing!
 - Laughing the stormy, husky, brawling laughter of
 - Youth, half-naked, sweating, proud to be Hog
 - Butcher, Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat, Player with
 - Railroads and Freight Handler to the Nation.
         
## SKETCH

  - THE shadows of the ships
 - Rock on the crest
 - In the low blue lustre
 - Of the tardy and the soft inrolling tide.
   - A long brown bar at the dip of the sky
 - Puts an arm of sand in the span of salt.
   - The lucid and endless wrinkles
 - Draw in, lapse and withdraw.
 - Wavelets crumble and white spent bubbles
 - Wash on the floor of the beach.
   - Rocking on the crest
 - In the low blue lustre
 - Are the shadows of the ships.
         
## MASSES

  - AMONG the mountains I wandered and saw blue haze and
 - red crag and was amazed;
 - On the beach where the long push under the endless tide
 - maneuvers, I stood silent;
 - Under the stars on the prairie watching the Dipper slant
 - over the horizon's grass, I was full of thoughts.
 - Great men, pageants of war and labor, soldiers and workers,
 - mothers lifting their children—these all I
 - touched, and felt the solemn thrill of them.
 - And then one day I got a true look at the Poor, millions
 - of the Poor, patient and toiling; more patient than
 - crags, tides, and stars; innumerable, patient as the
 - darkness of night—and all broken, humble ruins of nations.
         
##  LOST

  - DESOLATE and lone
 - All night long on the lake
 - Where fog trails and mist creeps,
 - The whistle of a boat
 - Calls and cries unendingly,
 - Like some lost child
 - In tears and trouble
 - Hunting the harbor's breast
 - And the harbor's eyes.
        
## THE HARBOR

  - PASSING through huddled and ugly walls
 - By doorways where women
 - Looked from their hunger-deep eyes,
 - Haunted with shadows of hunger-hands,
 - Out from the huddled and ugly walls,
 - I came sudden, at the city's edge,
 - On a blue burst of lake,
 - Long lake waves breaking under the sun
 - On a spray-flung curve of shore;
 - And a fluttering storm of gulls,
 - Masses of great gray wings
 - And flying white bellies
 - Veering and wheeling free in the open.
         
## THEY WILL SAY

  - OF my city the worst that men will ever say is this:
 - You took little children away from the sun and the dew,
 - And the glimmers that played in the grass under the great sky,
 - And the reckless rain; you put them between walls
 - To work, broken and smothered, for bread and wages,
 - To eat dust in their throats and die empty-hearted
 - For a little handful of pay on a few Saturday nights.
         
##  MILL-DOORS

  - YOU never come back.
 - I say good-by when I see you going in the doors,
 - The hopeless open doors that call and wait
 - And take you then for—how many cents a day?
 - How many cents for the sleepy eyes and fingers?
   - I say good-by because I know they tap your wrists,
 - In the dark, in the silence, day by day,
 - And all the blood of you drop by drop,
 - And you are old before you are young.
 - You never come back.
      
## HALSTED STREET CAR

  - COME you, cartoonists,
 - Hang on a strap with me here
 - At seven o'clock in the morning
 - On a Halsted street car.
   -      Take your pencils
 -      And draw these faces.
   - Try with your pencils for these crooked faces,
 - That pig-sticker in one corner—his mouth—
 - That overall factory girl—her loose cheeks.
   -      Find for your pencils
 -      A way to mark your memory
 -      Of tired empty faces.
   -      After their night's sleep,
 -      In the moist dawn
 -      And cool daybreak,
 -      Faces
 -      Tired of wishes,
 -      Empty of dreams.
       
## CLARK STREET BRIDGE

  - DUST of the feet
 - And dust of the wheels,
 - Wagons and people going,
 - All day feet and wheels.
   - Now. . .
 - . . Only stars and mist
 - A lonely policeman,
 - Two cabaret dancers,
 - Stars and mist again,
 - No more feet or wheels,
 - No more dust and wagons.
   - Voices of dollars
 - And drops of blood
 - . . . . .
 - Voices of broken hearts,
 - . . Voices singing, singing,
 - . . Silver voices, singing,
 - Softer than the stars,
 - Softer than the mist.
          
##  PASSERS-BY

  - PASSERS-BY,
 - Out of your many faces
 - Flash memories to me
 - Now at the day end
 - Away from the sidewalks
 - Where your shoe soles traveled
 - And your voices rose and blent
 - To form the city's afternoon roar
 - Hindering an old silence.
  - Passers-by,
 - I remember lean ones among you,
 - Throats in the clutch of a hope,
 - Lips written over with strivings,
 - Mouths that kiss only for love.
 - Records of great wishes slept with,
 - Held long
 - And prayed and toiled for. .
  - Yes,
 - Written on
 - Your mouths
 - And your throats
 - I read them
 - When you passed by.
          
## THE WALKING MAN OF RODIN

  - LEGS hold a torso away from the earth.
 - And a regular high poem of legs is here.
 - Powers of bone and cord raise a belly and lungs
 - Out of ooze and over the loam where eyes look and ears hear
 - And arms have a chance to hammer and shoot and run motors.
 - You make us
 - Proud of our legs, old man.
  - And you left off the head here,
 - The skull found always crumbling neighbor of the ankles.
         
## SUBWAY

  - DOWN between the walls of shadow
 - Where the iron laws insist,
 - The hunger voices mock.
  - The worn wayfaring men
 - With the hunched and humble shoulders,
 - Throw their laughter into toil.
        
## THE SHOVEL MAN

  - ON the street
 - Slung on his shoulder is a handle half way across,
 - Tied in a big knot on the scoop of cast iron
 - Are the overalls faded from sun and rain in the ditches;
 - Spatter of dry clay sticking yellow on his left sleeve
 - And a flimsy shirt open at the throat,
 - I know him for a shovel man,
 - A dago working for a dollar six bits a day
 - And a dark-eyed woman in the old country dreams of
 - him for one of the world's ready men with a pair
 - of fresh lips and a kiss better than all the wild
 - grapes that ever grew in Tuscany.
      
## A TEAMSTER'S FAREWELL

  -   Sobs En Route to a Penitentiary
 - GOOD-BY now to the streets and the clash of wheels and
 - locking hubs,
 - The sun coming on the brass buckles and harness knobs.
 - The muscles of the horses sliding under their heavy
 - haunches,
 - Good-by now to the traffic policeman and his whistle,
 - The smash of the iron hoof on the stones,
 - All the crazy wonderful slamming roar of the street—
 - O God, there's noises I'm going to be hungry for.
         
##  FISH CRIER

  - I KNOW a Jew fish crier down on Maxwell Street with a
 - voice like a north wind blowing over corn stubble
 - in January.
 - He dangles herring before prospective customers evincing
 - a joy identical with that of Pavlowa dancing.
 - His face is that of a man terribly glad to be selling fish,
 - terribly glad that God made fish, and customers to
 - whom he may call his wares, from a pushcart.
         
##  PICNIC BOAT

  - SUNDAY night and the park policemen tell each other it
 - is dark as a stack of black cats on Lake Michigan.
 - A big picnic boat comes home to Chicago from the peach
 - farms of Saugatuck.
 - Hundreds of electric bulbs break the night's darkness, a
 - flock of red and yellow birds with wings at a standstill.
 - Running along the deck railings are festoons and leaping
 - in curves are loops of light from prow and stern
 - to the tall smokestacks.
 - Over the hoarse crunch of waves at my pier comes a
 - hoarse answer in the rhythmic oompa of the brasses
 - playing a Polish folk-song for the home-comers.
         
##   HAPPINESS

  - I ASKED the professors who teach the meaning of life to tell
 - me what is happiness.
 - And I went to famous executives who boss the work of
 - thousands of men.
 - They all shook their heads and gave me a smile as though
 - I was trying to fool with them
 - And then one Sunday afternoon I wandered out along
 - the Desplaines river
 - And I saw a crowd of Hungarians under the trees with
 - their women and children and a keg of beer and an
 - accordion.
         
## MUCKERS

  - TWENTY men stand watching the muckers.
 - Stabbing the sides of the ditch
 - Where clay gleams yellow,
 - Driving the blades of their shovels
 - Deeper and deeper for the new gas mains
 - Wiping sweat off their faces
 -      With red bandanas
 - The muckers work on . . pausing . . to pull
 - Their boots out of suckholes where they slosh.
  - Of the twenty looking on
 - Ten murmer, "O, its a hell of a job,"
 - Ten others, "Jesus, I wish I had the job."
         
##  BLACKLISTED

  - WHY shall I keep the old name?
 - What is a name anywhere anyway?
 - A name is a cheap thing all fathers and mothers leave
 - each child:
 - A job is a job and I want to live, so
 - Why does God Almighty or anybody else care whether
 - I take a new name to go by?
         
##   GRACELAND

  - TOMB of a millionaire,
 - A multi-millionaire, ladies and gentlemen,
 - Place of the dead where they spend every year
 - The usury of twenty-five thousand dollars
 - For upkeep and flowers
 - To keep fresh the memory of the dead.
 - The merchant prince gone to dust
 - Commanded in his written will
 - Over the signed name of his last testament
 - Twenty-five thousand dollars be set aside
 - For roses, lilacs, hydrangeas, tulips,
 - For perfume and color, sweetness of remembrance
 - Around his last long home.
  - (A hundred cash girls want nickels to go to the movies to-night.
 - In the back stalls of a hundred saloons, women are at tables
 - Drinking with men or waiting for men jingling loose
 - silver dollars in their pockets.
 - In a hundred furnished rooms is a girl who sells silk or
 - dress goods or leather stuff for six dollars a week wages
 - And when she pulls on her stockings in the morning she
 - is reckless about God and the newspapers and the
 - police, the talk of her home town or the name
 - people call her.)
        
## CHILD OF THE ROMANS

  - THE dago shovelman sits by the railroad track
 - Eating a noon meal of bread and bologna.
 - A train whirls by, and men and women at tables
 - Alive with red roses and yellow jonquils,
 - Eat steaks running with brown gravy,
 - Strawberries and cream, eclaires and coffee.
 - The dago shovelman finishes the dry bread and bologna,
 - Washes it down with a dipper from the water-boy,
 - And goes back to the second half of a ten-hour day's work
 - Keeping the road-bed so the roses and jonquils
 - Shake hardly at all in the cut glass vases
 - Standing slender on the tables in the dining cars.
        
## THE RIGHT TO GRIEF

 - To Certain Poets About to Die
  - TAKE your fill of intimate remorse, perfumed sorrow,
 - Over the dead child of a millionaire,
 - And the pity of Death refusing any check on the bank
 - Which the millionaire might order his secretary to
 - scratch off
 - And get cashed.
  - Very well,
 - You for your grief and I for mine.
 - Let me have a sorrow my own if I want to.
  - I shall cry over the dead child of a stockyards hunky.
 - His job is sweeping blood off the floor.
 - He gets a dollar seventy cents a day when he works
 - And it's many tubs of blood he shoves out with a broom
 - day by day.
  - Now his three year old daughter
 - Is in a white coffin that cost him a week's wages.
 - Every Saturday night he will pay the undertaker fifty
 - cents till the debt is wiped out.
  - The hunky and his wife and the kids
 - Cry over the pinched face almost at peace in the white box.
   - They remember it was scrawny and ran up high doctor bills.
 - They are glad it is gone for the rest of the family now
 - will have more to eat and wear.
  - Yet before the majesty of Death they cry around the coffin
 - And wipe their eyes with red bandanas and sob when
 - the priest says, "God have mercy on us all."
  - I have a right to feel my throat choke about this.
 - You take your grief and I mine—see?
 - To-morrow there is no funeral and the hunky goes back
 - to his job sweeping blood off the floor at a dollar
 - seventy cents a day.
 - All he does all day long is keep on shoving hog blood
 - ahead of him with a broom
        
##   MAG

  - I WISH to God I never saw you, Mag.
 - I wish you never quit your job and came along with me.
 - I wish we never bought a license and a white dress
 - For you to get married in the day we ran off to a minister
 - And told him we would love each other and take care of
 - each other
 - Always and always long as the sun and the rain lasts anywhere.
 - Yes, I'm wishing now you lived somewhere away from here
 - And I was a bum on the bumpers a thousand miles away
 - dead broke.
 - I wish the kids had never come
 - And rent and coal and clothes to pay for
 - And a grocery man calling for cash,
 - Every day cash for beans and prunes.
 - I wish to God I never saw you, Mag.
 - I wish to God the kids had never come.
         
##  ONION DAYS

  - MRS. GABRIELLE GIOVANNITTI comes along Peoria Street
 - every morning at nine o'clock
 - With kindling wood piled on top of her head, her eyes
 - looking straight ahead to find the way for her old feet.
 - Her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Pietro Giovannitti, whose
 - husband was killed in a tunnel explosion through
 - the negligence of a fellow-servant,
 - Works ten hours a day, sometimes twelve, picking onions
 - for Jasper on the Bowmanville road.
 - She takes a street car at half-past five in the morning,
 - Mrs. Pietro Giovannitti does,
 - And gets back from Jasper's with cash for her day's
 - work, between nine and ten o'clock at night.
 - Last week she got eight cents a box, Mrs. Pietro
 - Giovannitti, picking onions for Jasper,
 - But this week Jasper dropped the pay to six cents a
 - box because so many women and girls were answering
 - the ads in the Daily News.
 - Jasper belongs to an Episcopal church in Ravenswood
 - and on certain Sundays
 - He enjoys chanting the Nicene creed with his daughters
 - on each side of him joining their voices with his.
 - If the preacher repeats old sermons of a Sunday, Jasper's
 - mind wanders to his 700-acre farm and how he
 - can make it produce more efficiently
   - And sometimes he speculates on whether he could word
 - an ad in the Daily News so it would bring more
 - women and girls out to his farm and reduce operating
 - costs.
 - Mrs. Pietro Giovannitti is far from desperate about life;
 - her joy is in a child she knows will arrive to her in
 - three months.
 - And now while these are the pictures for today there are
 - other pictures of the Giovannitti people I could give
 - you for to-morrow,
 - And how some of them go to the county agent on winter
 - mornings with their baskets for beans and cornmeal
 - and molasses.
 - I listen to fellows saying here's good stuff for a novel or
 - it might be worked up into a good play.
 - I say there's no dramatist living can put old Mrs.
 - Gabrielle Giovannitti into a play with that kindling
 - wood piled on top of her head coming along Peoria
 - Street nine o'clock in the morning.
     
## POPULATION DRIFTS

  - NEW-MOWN hay smell and wind of the plain made her
 - a woman whose ribs had the power of the hills in
 - them and her hands were tough for work and there
 - was passion for life in her womb.
 - She and her man crossed the ocean and the years that
 - marked their faces saw them haggling with landlords
 - and grocers while six children played on the stones
 - and prowled in the garbage cans.
 - One child coughed its lungs away, two more have adenoids
 - and can neither talk nor run like their mother,
 - one is in jail, two have jobs in a box factory
 - And as they fold the pasteboard, they wonder what the
 - wishing is and the wistful glory in them that flutters
 - faintly when the glimmer of spring comes on
 - the air or the green of summer turns brown:
 - They do not know it is the new-mown hay smell calling
 - and the wind of the plain praying for them to come
 - back and take hold of life again with tough hands
 - and with passion.
         
## CRIPPLE

  - ONCE when I saw a cripple
 - Gasping slowly his last days with the white plague,
 - Looking from hollow eyes, calling for air,
 - Desperately gesturing with wasted hands
 - In the dark and dust of a house down in a slum,
 - I said to myself
 - I would rather have been a tall sunflower
 - Living in a country garden
 - Lifting a golden-brown face to the summer,
 - Rain-washed and dew-misted,
 - Mixed with the poppies and ranking hollyhocks,
 - And wonderingly watching night after night
 - The clear silent processionals of stars.
         
## A FENCE

  - Now the stone house on the lake front is finished and the
 - workmen are beginning the fence.
 - The palings are made of iron bars with steel points that
 - can stab the life out of any man who falls on them.
 - As a fence, it is a masterpiece, and will shut off the rabble
 - and all vagabonds and hungry men and all wandering
 - children looking for a place to play.
 - Passing through the bars and over the steel points will go
 - nothing except Death and the Rain and To-morrow.
         
##  ANNA IMROTH

  - CROSS the hands over the breast here—so.
 - Straighten the legs a little more—so.
 - And call for the wagon to come and take her home.
 - Her mother will cry some and so will her sisters and
 - brothers.
 - But all of the others got down and they are safe and
 - this is the only one of the factory girls who
 - wasn't lucky in making the jump when the fire broke.
 - It is the hand of God and the lack of fire escapes.
         
## WORKING GIRLS

  - THE working girls in the morning are going to work—
 - long lines of them afoot amid the downtown stores
 - and factories, thousands with little brick-shaped
 - lunches wrapped in newspapers under their arms.
 - Each morning as I move through this river of young-
 - woman life I feel a wonder about where it is all
 - going, so many with a peach bloom of young years
 - on them and laughter of red lips and memories in
 - their eyes of dances the night before and plays and
 - walks.
 - Green and gray streams run side by side in a river and
 - so here are always the others, those who have been
 - over the way, the women who know each one the
 - end of life's gamble for her, the meaning and the
 - clew, the how and the why of the dances and the
 - arms that passed around their waists and the fingers
 - that played in their hair.
 - Faces go by written over: "I know it all, I know where
 - the bloom and the laughter go and I have memories,"
 - and the feet of these move slower and they
 - have wisdom where the others have beauty.
 - So the green and the gray move in the early morning
 - on the downtown streets.
         
##  MAMIE

  - MAMIE beat her head against the bars of a little Indiana
 - town and dreamed of romance and big things off
 - somewhere the way the railroad trains all ran.
 - She could see the smoke of the engines get lost down
 - where the streaks of steel flashed in the sun and
 - when the newspapers came in on the morning mail
 - she knew there was a big Chicago far off, where all
 - the trains ran.
 - She got tired of the barber shop boys and the post office
 - chatter and the church gossip and the old pieces the
 - band played on the Fourth of July and Decoration Day
 - And sobbed at her fate and beat her head against the
 - bars and was going to kill herself
 - When the thought came to her that if she was going to
 - die she might as well die struggling for a clutch of
 - romance among the streets of Chicago.
 - She has a job now at six dollars a week in the basement
 - of the Boston Store
 - And even now she beats her head against the bars in the
 - same old way and wonders if there is a bigger place
 - the railroads run to from Chicago where maybe
 - there is
  -      romance
 -      and big things
 -      and real dreams
 -      that never go smash.
         
##  PERSONALITY

  - *Musings of a Police Reporter in the Identification
  Bureau*
  - YOU have loved forty women, but you have only one thumb.
 - You have led a hundred secret lives, but you mark only
 - one thumb.
 - You go round the world and fight in a thousand wars and
 - win all the world's honors, but when you come back
 - home the print of the one thumb your mother gave
 - you is the same print of thumb you had in the old
 - home when your mother kissed you and said good-by.
 - Out of the whirling womb of time come millions of men
 - and their feet crowd the earth and they cut one anothers'
 - throats for room to stand and among them all
 - are not two thumbs alike.
 - Somewhere is a Great God of Thumbs who can tell the
 - inside story of this.
         
## CUMULATIVES

  - STORMS have beaten on this point of land
 - And ships gone to wreck here
 - and the passers-by remember it
 - with talk on the deck at night
 - as they near it.
  - Fists have beaten on the face of this old prize-fighter
 - And his battles have held the sporting pages
 - and on the street they indicate him with their
 - right fore-finger as one who once wore
 - a championship belt.
  - A hundred stories have been published and a thousand rumored
 - About why this tall dark man has divorced two beautiful
 - young women
 - And married a third who resembles the first two
 -      and they shake their heads and say, "There he
 - goes,"
 - when he passes by in sunny weather or in rain
 - along the city streets.
        
## TO CERTAIN JOURNEYMEN

  - UNDERTAKERS, hearse drivers, grave diggers,
 - I speak to you as one not afraid of your business.
   - You handle dust going to a long country,
 - You know the secret behind your job is the same whether
 - you lower the coffin with modern, automatic machinery,
 - well-oiled and noiseless, or whether the
 - body is laid in by naked hands and then covered
 - by the shovels.
   - Your day's work is done with laughter many days of the year,
 - And you earn a living by those who say good-by today
 - in thin whispers.
         
##   CHAMFORT

  - THERE'S Chamfort. He's a sample.
 - Locked himself in his library with a gun,
 - Shot off his nose and shot out his right eye.
 - And this Chamfort knew how to write
 - And thousands read his books on how to live,
 - But he himself didn't know
 - How to die by force of his own hand—see?
 - They found him a red pool on the carpet
 - Cool as an April forenoon,
 - Talking and talking gay maxims and grim epigrams.
 - Well, he wore bandages over his nose and right eye,
 - Drank coffee and chatted many years
 - With men and women who loved him
 - Because he laughed and daily dared Death:
 - "Come and take me."
         
## LIMITED

  - I AM riding on a limited express, one of the crack trains
 - of the nation.
 - Hurtling across the prairie into blue haze and dark air
 - go fifteen all-steel coaches holding a thousand people.
 - (All the coaches shall be scrap and rust and all the men
 - and women laughing in the diners and sleepers shall
 - pass to ashes.)
 - I ask a man in the smoker where he is going and he
 - answers: "Omaha."
         
## THE HAS-BEEN

  - A STONE face higher than six horses stood five thousand
 - years gazing at the world seeming to clutch a secret.
 - A boy passes and throws a niggerhead that chips off the
 - end of the nose from the stone face; he lets fly a
 - mud ball that spatters the right eye and cheek of the
 - old looker-on.
 - The boy laughs and goes whistling "ee-ee-ee ee-ee-ee."
 - The stone face stands silent, seeming to clutch a
 - secret.
         
## IN A BACK ALLEY

  - REMEMBRANCE for a great man is this.
 - The newsies are pitching pennies.
 - And on the copper disk is the man's face.
 - Dead lover of boys, what do you ask for now?
         
## A COIN

  - YOUR western heads here cast on money,
 - You are the two that fade away together,
 -      Partners in the mist.
  -      Lunging buffalo shoulder,
 -      Lean Indian face,
 - We who come after where you are gone
 - Salute your forms on the new nickel.
  -      You are
 -      To us:
 -      The past.
  -      Runners
 -      On the prairie:
 -      Good-by.
         
##   DYNAMITER

  - I SAT with a dynamiter at supper in a German saloon
 - eating steak and onions.
 - And he laughed and told stories of his wife and children
 - and the cause of labor and the working class.
 - It was laughter of an unshakable man knowing life to be
 - a rich and red-blooded thing.
 - Yes, his laugh rang like the call of gray birds filled with
 - a glory of joy ramming their winged flight through
 - a rain storm.
 - His name was in many newspapers as an enemy of the
 - nation and few keepers of churches or schools would
 - open their doors to him.
 - Over the steak and onions not a word was said of his
 - deep days and nights as a dynamiter.
 - Only I always remember him as a lover of life, a lover
 - of children, a lover of all free, reckless laughter
 - everywhere—lover of red hearts and red blood the
 - world over.
         
##  ICE HANDLER

  - I KNOW an ice handler who wears a flannel shirt with
 - pearl buttons the size of a dollar,
 - And he lugs a hundred-pound hunk into a saloon ice-
 - box, helps himself to cold ham and rye bread,
 - Tells the bartender it's hotter than yesterday and will be
 - hotter yet to-morrow, by Jesus,
 - And is on his way with his head in the air and a hard
 - pair of fists.
 - He spends a dollar or so every Saturday night on a two
 - hundred pound woman who washes dishes in the
 - Hotel Morrison.
 - He remembers when the union was organized he broke
 - the noses of two scabs and loosened the nuts so the
 - wheels came off six different wagons one morning,
 - and he came around and watched the ice melt in the
 - street.
 - All he was sorry for was one of the scabs bit him on the
 - knuckles of the right hand so they bled when he
 - came around to the saloon to tell the boys about it.
         
##  JACK

  - JACK was a swarthy, swaggering son-of-a-gun.
 - He worked thirty years on the railroad, ten hours a day,
 - and his hands were tougher than sole leather.
 - He married a tough woman and they had eight children
 - and the woman died and the children grew up and
 - went away and wrote the old man every two years.
 - He died in the poorhouse sitting on a bench in the sun
 - telling reminiscences to other old men whose women
 - were dead and children scattered.
 - There was joy on his face when he died as there was joy
 - on his face when he lived—he was a swarthy, swaggering
 - son-of-a-gun.
        
## FELLOW CITIZENS

  - I DRANK musty ale at the Illinois Athletic Club with
 - the millionaire manufacturer of Green River butter
 - one night
 - And his face had the shining light of an old-time Quaker,
 - he spoke of a beautiful daughter, and I knew he had
 - a peace and a happiness up his sleeve somewhere.
 - Then I heard Jim Kirch make a speech to the Advertising
 - Association on the trade resources of South America.
 - And the way he lighted a three-for-a-nickel stogie and
 - cocked it at an angle regardless of the manners of
 - our best people,
 - I knew he had a clutch on a real happiness even though
 - some of the reporters on his newspaper say he is
 - the living double of Jack London's Sea Wolf.
 - In the mayor's office the mayor himself told me he was
 - happy though it is a hard job to satisfy all the office-
 - seekers and eat all the dinners he is asked to eat.
 - Down in Gilpin Place, near Hull House, was a man with
 - his jaw wrapped for a bad toothache,
 - And he had it all over the butter millionaire, Jim Kirch
 - and the mayor when it came to happiness.
 - He is a maker of accordions and guitars and not only
 - makes them from start to finish, but plays them
 - after he makes them.
   - And he had a guitar of mahogany with a walnut bottom
 - he offered for seven dollars and a half if I wanted it,
 - And another just like it, only smaller, for six dollars,
 - though he never mentioned the price till I asked him,
 - And he stated the price in a sorry way, as though the
 - music and the make of an instrument count for a
 - million times more than the price in money.
 - I thought he had a real soul and knew a lot about God.
 - There was light in his eyes of one who has conquered
 - sorrow in so far as sorrow is conquerable or worth
 - conquering.
 - Anyway he is the only Chicago citizen I was jealous of
 - that day.
 - He played a dance they play in some parts of Italy
 - when the harvest of grapes is over and the wine
 - presses are ready for work.
         
## NIGGER

  - I AM the nigger.
 - Singer of songs,
 - Dancer. . .
 - Softer than fluff of cotton. . .
 - Harder than dark earth
 - Roads beaten in the sun
 - By the bare feet of slaves. . .
 - Foam of teeth. . . breaking crash of laughter. . .
 - Red love of the blood of woman,
 - White love of the tumbling pickaninnies. . .
 - Lazy love of the banjo thrum. . .
 - Sweated and driven for the harvest-wage,
 - Loud laugher with hands like hams,
 - Fists toughened on the handles,
 - Smiling the slumber dreams of old jungles,
 - Crazy as the sun and dew and dripping, heaving life
 - of the jungle,
 - Brooding and muttering with memories of shackles:
 -      I am the nigger.
 -      Look at me.
 -      I am the nigger.
         
## TWO NEIGHBORS

  - FACES of two eternities keep looking at me.
 - One is Omar Khayam and the red stuff
 - wherein men forget yesterday and to-morrow
 - and remember only the voices and songs,
 - the stories, newspapers and fights of today.
 - One is Louis Cornaro and a slim trick
 - of slow, short meals across slow, short years,
 - letting Death open the door only in slow, short inches.
 - I have a neighbor who swears by Omar.
 - I have a neighbor who swears by Cornaro.
 - Both are happy.
 - Faces of two eternities keep looking at me.
 - Let them look.
         
##  STYLE

  - STYLE—go ahead talking about style.
 - You can tell where a man gets his style just
 - as you can tell where Pavlowa got her legs
 - or Ty Cobb his batting eye.
  - Go on talking.
 - Only don't take my style away.
 - It's my face.
 - Maybe no good
 -      but anyway, my face.
 - I talk with it, I sing with it, I see, taste and feel with it,
 - I know why I want to keep it.
  - Kill my style
 -      and you break Pavlowa's legs,
 -      and you blind Ty Cobb's batting eye.
          
## TO BEACHEY, 1912

  - RIDING against the east,
 - A veering, steady shadow
 - Purrs the motor-call
 - Of the man-bird
 - Ready with the death-laughter
 - In his throat
 - And in his heart always
 - The love of the big blue beyond.
  - Only a man,
 - A far fleck of shadow on the east
 - Sitting at ease
 - With his hands on a wheel
 - And around him the large gray wings.
 - Hold him, great soft wings,
 - Keep and deal kindly, O wings,
 - With the cool, calm shadow at the wheel.
       
## UNDER A HAT RIM

  - WHILE the hum and the hurry
 - Of passing footfalls
 - Beat in my ear like the restless surf
 - Of a wind-blown sea,
 - A soul came to me
 - Out of the look on a face.
  - Eyes like a lake
 - Where a storm-wind roams
 - Caught me from under
 - The rim of a hat.
 - I thought of a midsea wreck
 - and bruised fingers clinging
 - to a broken state-room door.
         
## IN A BREATH

  - *To the Williamson Brothers*
 - HIGH noon. White sun flashes on the Michigan Avenue
 - asphalt. Drum of hoofs and whirr of motors.
 - Women trapsing along in flimsy clothes catching
 - play of sun-fire to their skin and eyes.
  - Inside the playhouse are movies from under the sea.
 - From the heat of pavements and the dust of sidewalks,
 - passers-by go in a breath to be witnesses of
 - large cool sponges, large cool fishes, large cool valleys
 - and ridges of coral spread silent in the soak of
 - the ocean floor thousands of years.
  - A naked swimmer dives. A knife in his right hand
 - shoots a streak at the throat of a shark. The tail
 - of the shark lashes. One swing would kill the swimmer. . .
 - Soon the knife goes into the soft under-
 - neck of the veering fish. . . Its mouthful of teeth,
 - each tooth a dagger itself, set row on row, glistens
 - when the shuddering, yawning cadaver is hauled up
 - by the brothers of the swimmer.
  - Outside in the street is the murmur and singing of life
 - in the sun—horses, motors, women trapsing along
 - in flimsy clothes, play of sun-fire in their blood.
         
##  BATH

  - A MAN saw the whole world as a grinning skull and
 - cross-bones. The rose flesh of life shriveled from all
 - faces. Nothing counts. Everything is a fake. Dust to
 - dust and ashes to ashes and then an old darkness and a
 - useless silence. So he saw it all. Then he went to a
 - Mischa Elman concert. Two hours waves of sound beat
 - on his eardrums. Music washed something or other
 - inside him. Music broke down and rebuilt something or
 - other in his head and heart. He joined in five encores
 - for the young Russian Jew with the fiddle. When he
 - got outside his heels hit the sidewalk a new way. He
 - was the same man in the same world as before. Only
 - there was a singing fire and a climb of roses everlastingly
 - over the world he looked on.
         
## BRONZES

 -    I
  - THE bronze General Grant riding a bronze horse in Lincoln
 - Park
 - Shrivels in the sun by day when the motor cars whirr
 - by in long processions going somewhere to keep appointment
 - for dinner and matinees and buying and selling
 - Though in the dusk and nightfall when high waves are piling
 - On the slabs of the promenade along the lake shore near by
 - I have seen the general dare the combers come closer
 - And make to ride his bronze horse out into the hoofs
 - and guns of the storm.
     - II
 - I cross Lincoln Park on a winter night when the snow
 - is falling.
 - Lincoln in bronze stands among the white lines of snow,
 - his bronze forehead meeting soft echoes of the newsies
 - crying forty thousand men are dead along the
 - Yser, his bronze ears listening to the mumbled roar
 - of the city at his bronze feet.
 - A lithe Indian on a bronze pony, Shakespeare seated with
 - long legs in bronze, Garibaldi in a bronze cape, they
 - hold places in the cold, lonely snow to-night on their
 - pedestals and so they will hold them past midnight
 - and into the dawn.
      
##  DUNES

  - WHAT do we see here in the sand dunes of the white
 - moon alone with our thoughts, Bill,
 - Alone with our dreams, Bill, soft as the women tying
 - scarves around their heads dancing,
 - Alone with a picture and a picture coming one after the
 - other of all the dead,
 - The dead more than all these grains of sand one by one
 - piled here in the moon,
 - Piled against the sky-line taking shapes like the hand of
 - the wind wanted,
 - What do we see here, Bill, outside of what the wise men
 - beat their heads on,
 - Outside of what the poets cry for and the soldiers drive
 - on headlong and leave their skulls in the sun for—
 - what, Bill?
       
## ON THE WAY

  - LITTLE one, you have been buzzing in the books,
 - Flittering in the newspapers and drinking beer with
 - lawyers
 - And amid the educated men of the clubs you have been
 - getting an earful of speech from trained tongues.
 - Take an earful from me once, go with me on a hike
 - Along sand stretches on the great inland sea here
 - And while the eastern breeze blows on us and the
 - restless surge
 - Of the lake waves on the breakwater breaks with an ever
 - fresh monotone,
 - Let us ask ourselves: What is truth? what do you or I
 - know?
 - How much do the wisest of the world's men know about
 - where the massed human procession is going?
  - You have heard the mob laughed at?
 - I ask you: Is not the mob rough as the mountains are
 - rough?
 - And all things human rise from the mob and relapse and
 - rise again as rain to the sea?
         
## READY TO KILL

  - TEN minutes now I have been looking at this.
 - I have gone by here before and wondered about it.
 - This is a bronze memorial of a famous general
 - Riding horseback with a flag and a sword and a revolver
 - on him.
 - I want to smash the whole thing into a pile of junk to be
 - hauled away to the scrap yard.
 - I put it straight to you,
 - After the farmer, the miner, the shop man, the factory
 - hand, the fireman and the teamster,
 - Have all been remembered with bronze memorials,
 - Shaping them on the job of getting all of us
 - Something to eat and something to wear,
 - When they stack a few silhouettes
 - Against the sky
 - Here in the park,
 - And show the real huskies that are doing the work of
 - the world, and feeding people instead of butchering them,
 - Then maybe I will stand here
 - And look easy at this general of the army holding a flag
 - in the air,
 - And riding like hell on horseback
 - Ready to kill anybody that gets in his way,
 - Ready to run the red blood and slush the bowels of men
 - all over the sweet new grass of the prairie.
      
## TO A CONTEMPORARY BUNKSHOOTER

  - YOU come along. . . tearing your shirt. . . yelling about
 - Jesus.
 - Where do you get that stuff?
 - What do you know about Jesus?
 - Jesus had a way of talking soft and outside of a few
 - bankers and higher-ups among the con men of Jerusalem
 - everybody liked to have this Jesus around because
 - he never made any fake passes and everything
 - he said went and he helped the sick and gave the
 - people hope.
  - You come along squirting words at us, shaking your fist
 - and calling us all dam fools so fierce the froth slobbers
 - over your lips. . . always blabbing we're all
 - going to hell straight off and you know all about it.
  - I've read Jesus' words. I know what he said. You don't
 - throw any scare into me. I've got your number. I
 - know how much you know about Jesus.
 - He never came near clean people or dirty people but
 - they felt cleaner because he came along. It was your
 - crowd of bankers and business men and lawyers
 - hired the sluggers and murderers who put Jesus out
 - of the running.
    - I say the same bunch backing you nailed the nails into
 - the hands of this Jesus of Nazareth. He had lined
 - up against him the same crooks and strong-arm men
 - now lined up with you paying your way.
  - This Jesus was good to look at, smelled good, listened
 - good. He threw out something fresh and beautiful
 - from the skin of his body and the touch of his hands
 - wherever he passed along.
 - You slimy bunkshooter, you put a smut on every human
 - blossom in reach of your rotten breath belching
 - about hell-fire and hiccupping about this Man who
 - lived a clean life in Galilee.
  - When are you going to quit making the carpenters build
 - emergency hospitals for women and girls driven
 - crazy with wrecked nerves from your gibberish about
 - Jesus—I put it to you again: Where do you get that
 - stuff; what do you know about Jesus?
  - Go ahead and bust all the chairs you want to. Smash
 - a whole wagon load of furniture at every performance.
 - Turn sixty somersaults and stand on your
 - nutty head. If it wasn't for the way you scare the
 - women and kids I'd feel sorry for you and pass the hat.
 - I like to watch a good four-flusher work, but not when
 - he starts people puking and calling for the doctors.
 - I like a man that's got nerve and can pull off a great
 - original performance, but you—you're only a bug-
 - house peddler of second-hand gospel—you're only
  - shoving out a phoney imitation of the goods this
 - Jesus wanted free as air and sunlight.
  - You tell people living in shanties Jesus is going to fix it
 - up all right with them by giving them mansions in
 - the skies after they're dead and the worms have
 - eaten 'em.
 - You tell $6 a week department store girls all they need
 - is Jesus; you take a steel trust wop, dead without
 - having lived, gray and shrunken at forty years of
 - age, and you tell him to look at Jesus on the cross
 - and he'll be all right.
 - You tell poor people they don't need any more money
 - on pay day and even if it's fierce to be out of a job,
 - Jesus'll fix that up all right, all right—all they gotta
 - do is take Jesus the way you say.
 - I'm telling you Jesus wouldn't stand for the stuff you're
 - handing out. Jesus played it different. The bankers
 - and lawyers of Jerusalem got their sluggers and
 - murderers to go after Jesus just because Jesus
 - wouldn't play their game. He didn't sit in with
 - the big thieves.
  - I don't want a lot of gab from a bunkshooter in my religion.
 - I won't take my religion from any man who never works
 - except with his mouth and never cherishes any memory
 - except the face of the woman on the American
 - silver dollar.
  - I ask you to come through and show me where you're
 - pouring out the blood of your life.
     - I've been to this suburb of Jerusalem they call Golgotha,
 - where they nailed Him, and I know if the story is
 - straight it was real blood ran from His hands and
 - the nail-holes, and it was real blood spurted in red
 - drops where the spear of the Roman soldier rammed
 - in between the ribs of this Jesus of Nazareth.
         
##  SKYSCRAPER

  - BY day the skyscraper looms in the smoke and sun and
 - has a soul.
 - Prairie and valley, streets of the city, pour people into
 - it and they mingle among its twenty floors and are
 - poured out again back to the streets, prairies and
 - valleys.
 - It is the men and women, boys and girls so poured in and
 - out all day that give the building a soul of dreams
 - and thoughts and memories.
 - (Dumped in the sea or fixed in a desert, who would care
 - for the building or speak its name or ask a policeman
 - the way to it?)
  - Elevators slide on their cables and tubes catch letters and
 - parcels and iron pipes carry gas and water in and
 - sewage out.
 - Wires climb with secrets, carry light and carry words,
 - and tell terrors and profits and loves—curses of men
 - grappling plans of business and questions of women
 - in plots of love.
  - Hour by hour the caissons reach down to the rock of the
 - earth and hold the building to a turning planet.
 - Hour by hour the girders play as ribs and reach out and
 - hold together the stone walls and floors.
      - Hour by hour the hand of the mason and the stuff of the
 - mortar clinch the pieces and parts to the shape an
 - architect voted.
 - Hour by hour the sun and the rain, the air and the rust,
 - and the press of time running into centuries, play
 - on the building inside and out and use it.
  - Men who sunk the pilings and mixed the mortar are laid
 - in graves where the wind whistles a wild song
 - without words
 - And so are men who strung the wires and fixed the pipes
 - and tubes and those who saw it rise floor by floor.
 - Souls of them all are here, even the hod carrier begging
 - at back doors hundreds of miles away and the brick-
 - layer who went to state's prison for shooting another
 - man while drunk.
 - (One man fell from a girder and broke his neck at the
 - end of a straight plunge—he is here—his soul has
 - gone into the stones of the building.)
  - On the office doors from tier to tier—hundreds of names
 - and each name standing for a face written across
 - with a dead child, a passionate lover, a driving
 - ambition for a million dollar business or a lobster's
 - ease of life.
  - Behind the signs on the doors they work and the walls
 - tell nothing from room to room.
 - Ten-dollar-a-week stenographers take letters from
 - corporation officers, lawyers, efficiency engineers,
 - and tons of letters go bundled from the building to all
 - ends of the earth.
  - Smiles and tears of each office girl go into the soul of
 - the building just the same as the master-men who
 - rule the building.
  - Hands of clocks turn to noon hours and each floor
 - empties its men and women who go away and eat
 - and come back to work.
 - Toward the end of the afternoon all work slackens and
 - all jobs go slower as the people feel day closing on
 - them.
 - One by one the floors are emptied. . . The uniformed
 - elevator men are gone. Pails clang. . . Scrubbers
 - work, talking in foreign tongues. Broom and water
 - and mop clean from the floors human dust and spit,
 - and machine grime of the day.
 - Spelled in electric fire on the roof are words telling
 - miles of houses and people where to buy a thing for
 - money. The sign speaks till midnight.
  - Darkness on the hallways. Voices echo. Silence
 - holds. . . Watchmen walk slow from floor to floor
 - and try the doors. Revolvers bulge from their hip
 - pockets. . . Steel safes stand in corners. Money
 - is stacked in them.
 - A young watchman leans at a window and sees the lights
 - of barges butting their way across a harbor, nets of
 - red and white lanterns in a railroad yard, and a span
 - of glooms splashed with lines of white and blurs of
 - crosses and clusters over the sleeping city.
 - By night the skyscraper looms in the smoke and the stars
 - and has a soul.
        
# HANDFULS

   
## FOG

  - THE fog comes
 - on little cat feet.
  - It sits looking
 - over harbor and city
 - on silent haunches
 - and then moves on.
       
## POOL

  - OUT of the fire
 - Came a man sunken
 - To less than cinders,
 - A tea-cup of ashes or so.
 - And I,
 - The gold in the house,
 - Writhed into a stiff pool.
      
##  JAN KUBELIK

  - YOUR bow swept over a string, and a long low note
 - quivered to the air.
 - (A mother of Bohemia sobs over a new child perfect
 - learning to suck milk.)
  - Your bow ran fast over all the high strings fluttering
 - and wild.
 - (All the girls in Bohemia are laughing on a Sunday afternoon
 - in the hills with their lovers.)
      
## CHOOSE

  - THE single clenched fist lifted and ready,
 - Or the open asking hand held out and waiting.
 -      Choose:
 - For we meet by one or the other.
      
## CRIMSON

  - CRIMSON is the slow smolder of the cigar end I hold,
 - Gray is the ash that stiffens and covers all silent the fire.
 - (A great man I know is dead and while he lies in his
 - coffin a gone flame I sit here in cumbering shadows
 - and smoke and watch my thoughts come and go.)
      
##  WHITELIGHT

  - YOUR whitelight flashes the frost to-night
 - Moon of the purple and silent west.
 - Remember me one of your lovers of dreams.
      
## FLUX

  - SAND of the sea runs red
 - Where the sunset reaches and quivers.
 - Sand of the sea runs yellow
 - Where the moon slants and wavers.
      
## KIN

  - BROTHER, I am fire
 - Surging under the ocean floor.
 - I shall never meet you, brother—
 - Not for years, anyhow;
 - Maybe thousands of years, brother.
 - Then I will warm you,
 - Hold you close, wrap you in circles,
 - Use you and change you—
 - Maybe thousands of years, brother.
       
## WHITE SHOULDERS

  - YOUR white shoulders
 - I remember
 - And your shrug of laughter.
  - Low laughter
 - Shaken slow
 - From your white shoulders.
      
## LOSSES

  - I HAVE love
 - And a child,
 - A banjo
 - And shadows.
 - (Losses of God,
 - All will go
 - And one day
 - We will hold
 - Only the shadows.)
      
## TROTHS

  - YELLOW dust on a bumble
 - bee's wing,
 - Grey lights in a woman's
 - asking eyes,
 - Red ruins in the changing
 - sunset embers:
 - I take you and pile high
 - the memories.
 - Death will break her claws
 - on some I keep.
        
# WAR POEMS
 (1914-1915)

     
## KILLERS

  - I AM singing to you
 - Soft as a man with a dead child speaks;
 - Hard as a man in handcuffs,
 - Held where he cannot move:
  - Under the sun
 - Are sixteen million men,
 - Chosen for shining teeth,
 - Sharp eyes, hard legs,
 - And a running of young warm blood in their wrists.
  - And a red juice runs on the green grass;
 - And a red juice soaks the dark soil.
 - And the sixteen million are killing. . . and killing
 - and killing.
  - I never forget them day or night:
 - They beat on my head for memory of them;
 - They pound on my heart and I cry back to them,
 - To their homes and women, dreams and games.
  - I wake in the night and smell the trenches,
 - And hear the low stir of sleepers in lines—
 - Sixteen million sleepers and pickets in the dark:
 - Some of them long sleepers for always,
    - Some of them tumbling to sleep to-morrow for always,
 - Fixed in the drag of the world's heartbreak,
 - Eating and drinking, toiling. . . on a long job of
 - killing.
 - Sixteen million men.
      
## AMONG THE RED GUNS

 - * After waking at dawn one morning when the wind sang
  low among dry leaves in an elm*
  - AMONG the red guns,
 - In the hearts of soldiers
 - Running free blood
 - In the long, long campaign:
 - Dreams go on.
  - Among the leather saddles,
 - In the heads of soldiers
 - Heavy in the wracks and kills
 - Of all straight fighting:
 - Dreams go on.
  - Among the hot muzzles,
 - In the hands of soldiers
 - Brought from flesh-folds of women—
 - Soft amid the blood and crying—
 - In all your hearts and heads
 - Among the guns and saddles and muzzles:
  - Dreams,
 - Dreams go on,
 - Out of the dead on their backs,
 - Broken and no use any more:
 - Dreams of the way and the end go on.
      
##  IRON

  - GUNS,
 - Long, steel guns,
 - Pointed from the war ships
 - In the name of the war god.
 - Straight, shining, polished guns,
 - Clambered over with jackies in white blouses,
 - Glory of tan faces, tousled hair, white teeth,
 - Laughing lithe jackies in white blouses,
 - Sitting on the guns singing war songs, war chanties.
   - Shovels,
 - Broad, iron shovels,
 - Scooping out oblong vaults,
 - Loosening turf and leveling sod.
  - I ask you
 - To witness—
 - The shovel is brother to the gun.
      
## MURMURINGS IN A FIELD HOSPITAL

 *They picked him up in the grass where he had lain two days in the rain with a piece of shrapnel in his lungs.*

  - COME to me only with playthings now. . .
 - A picture of a singing woman with blue eyes
 - Standing at a fence of hollyhocks, poppies and sunflowers. . .
 - Or an old man I remember sitting with children telling stories
 - Of days that never happened anywhere in the world. . .
  - No more iron cold and real to handle,
 - Shaped for a drive straight ahead.
 - Bring me only beautiful useless things.
 - Only old home things touched at sunset in the quiet. . .
 - And at the window one day in summer
 - Yellow of the new crock of butter
 - Stood against the red of new climbing roses. . .
 - And the world was all playthings.
      
##  STATISTICS

  - NAPOLEON shifted,
 - Restless in the old sarcophagus
 - And murmured to a watchguard:
 - "Who goes there?"
 - "Twenty-one million men,
 - Soldiers, armies, guns,
 - Twenty-one million
 - Afoot, horseback,
 - In the air,
 - Under the sea."
 - And Napoleon turned to his sleep:
 - "It is not my world answering;
 - It is some dreamer who knows not
 - The world I marched in
 - From Calais to Moscow."
 - And he slept on
 - In the old sarcophagus
 - While the aeroplanes
 - Droned their motors
 - Between Napoleon's mausoleum
 - And the cool night stars.
      
## FIGHT

  - RED drips from my chin where I have been eating.
 - Not all the blood, nowhere near all, is wiped off my mouth.
  - Clots of red mess my hair
 - And the tiger, the buffalo, know how.
  - I was a killer.
 - Yes, I am a killer.
  - I come from killing.
 - I go to more.
 - I drive red joy ahead of me from killing.
 - Red gluts and red hungers run in the smears and juices
 - of my inside bones:
 - The child cries for a suck mother and I cry for war.
      
## BUTTONS

  - I HAVE been watching the war map slammed up for
 - advertising in front of the newspaper office.
 - Buttons—red and yellow buttons—blue and black buttons—
 - are shoved back and forth across the map.
  - A laughing young man, sunny with freckles,
 - Climbs a ladder, yells a joke to somebody in the crowd,
 - And then fixes a yellow button one inch west
 - And follows the yellow button with a black button one
 - inch west.
  - (Ten thousand men and boys twist on their bodies in
 - a red soak along a river edge,
 - Gasping of wounds, calling for water, some rattling
 - death in their throats.)
 - Who would guess what it cost to move two buttons one
 - inch on the war map here in front of the newspaper
 - office where the freckle-faced young man is laughing
 - to us?
      
## AND THEY OBEY

  - SMASH down the cities.
 - Knock the walls to pieces.
 - Break the factories and cathedrals, warehouses
 - and homes
 - Into loose piles of stone and lumber and black
 - burnt wood:
 - You are the soldiers and we command you.
  - Build up the cities.
 - Set up the walls again.
 - Put together once more the factories and cathedrals,
 - warehouses and homes
 - Into buildings for life and labor:
 - You are workmen and citizens all: We
 - command you.
      
##  JAWS

  - SEVEN nations stood with their hands on the jaws of death.
 - It was the first week in August, Nineteen Hundred Fourteen.
 - I was listening, you were listening, the whole world was
 - listening,
 - And all of us heard a Voice murmuring:
 -      "I am the way and the light,
 -      He that believeth on me
 -      Shall not perish
 -      But shall have everlasting life."
 - Seven nations listening heard the Voice and answered:
 -      "O Hell!"
 - The jaws of death began clicking and they go on clicking.
 -      "O Hell!"
         
## SALVAGE

  - GUNS on the battle lines have pounded now a year
 - between Brussels and Paris.
 - And, William Morris, when I read your old chapter on
 - the great arches and naves and little whimsical
 - corners of the Churches of Northern France—Brr-rr!
 - I'm glad you're a dead man, William Morris, I'm glad
 - you're down in the damp and mouldy, only a memory
 - instead of a living man—I'm glad you're gone.
 - You never lied to us, William Morris, you loved the
 - shape of those stones piled and carved for you to
 - dream over and wonder because workmen got joy
 - of life into them,
 - Workmen in aprons singing while they hammered, and
 - praying, and putting their songs and prayers into
 - the walls and roofs, the bastions and cornerstones
 - and gargoyles—all their children and kisses of
 - women and wheat and roses growing.
 - I say, William Morris, I'm glad you're gone, I'm glad
 - you're a dead man.
 - Guns on the battle lines have pounded a year now between
 - Brussels and Paris.
       
##  WARS

  - IN the old wars drum of hoofs and the beat of shod feet.
 - In the new wars hum of motors and the tread of rubber tires.
 - In the wars to come silent wheels and whirr of rods not
 - yet dreamed out in the heads of men.
  - In the old wars clutches of short swords and jabs into
 - faces with spears.
 - In the new wars long range guns and smashed walls, guns
 - running a spit of metal and men falling in tens and
 - twenties.
 - In the wars to come new silent deaths, new silent hurlers
 - not yet dreamed out in the heads of men.
  - In the old wars kings quarreling and thousands of men
 - following.
 - In the new wars kings quarreling and millions of men
 - following.
 - In the wars to come kings kicked under the dust and
 - millions of men following great causes not yet
 - dreamed out in the heads of men.
       
# THE ROAD AND THE END

     
## THE ROAD AND THE END

  - I SHALL foot it
 - Down the roadway in the dusk,
 - Where shapes of hunger wander
 - And the fugitives of pain go by.
 - I shall foot it
 - In the silence of the morning,
 - See the night slur into dawn,
 - Hear the slow great winds arise
 - Where tall trees flank the way
 - And shoulder toward the sky.
  - The broken boulders by the road
 - Shall not commemorate my ruin.
 - Regret shall be the gravel under foot.
 - I shall watch for
 - Slim birds swift of wing
 - That go where wind and ranks of thunder
 - Drive the wild processionals of rain.
  - The dust of the traveled road
 - Shall touch my hands and face.
      
## CHOICES

  - THEY offer you many things,
 - I a few.
 - Moonlight on the play of fountains at night
 - With water sparkling a drowsy monotone,
 - Bare-shouldered, smiling women and talk
 - And a cross-play of loves and adulteries
 - And a fear of death and a remembering of regrets:
 - All this they offer you.
 - I come with:
 - salt and bread
 - a terrible job of work
 - and tireless war;
 - Come and have now:
 - hunger.
 - danger
 - and hate.
      
## GRAVES

  - I DREAMED one man stood against a thousand,
 - One man damned as a wrongheaded fool.
 - One year and another he walked the streets,
 - And a thousand shrugs and hoots
 - Met him in the shoulders and mouths he passed.
  - He died alone.
 - And only the undertaker came to his funeral.
  - Flowers grow over his grave anod in the wind,
 - And over the graves of the thousand, too,
 - The flowers grow anod in the wind.
  - Flowers and the wind,
 - Flowers anod over the graves of the dead,
 - Petals of red, leaves of yellow, streaks of white,
 - Masses of purple sagging. . .
 - I love you and your great way of forgetting.
      
##  AZTEC MASK

  - I WANTED a man's face looking into the jaws and throat
 - of life
 - With something proud on his face, so proud no smash
 - of the jaws,
 - No gulp of the throat leaves the face in the end
 - With anything else than the old proud look:
 - Even to the finish, dumped in the dust,
 - Lost among the used-up cinders,
 - This face, men would say, is a flash,
 - Is laid on bones taken from the ribs of the earth,
 - Ready for the hammers of changing, changing years,
 - Ready for the sleeping, sleeping years of silence.
 - Ready for the dust and fire and wind.
 - I wanted this face and I saw it today in an Aztec mask.
 - A cry out of storm and dark, a red yell and a purple prayer,
 - A beaten shape of ashes
 -      waiting the sunrise or night,
 -      something or nothing,
 -      proud-mouthed,
 -      proud-eyed gambler.
      
##  MOMUS

  - MOMUS is the name men give your face,
 - The brag of its tone, like a long low steamboat whistle
 - Finding a way mid mist on a shoreland,
 - Where gray rocks let the salt water shatter spray
 - Against horizons purple, silent.
  - Yes, Momus,
 - Men have flung your face in bronze
 - To gaze in gargoyle downward on a street-whirl of folk.
 - They were artists did this, shaped your sad mouth,
 - Gave you a tall forehead slanted with calm, broad wisdom;
 - All your lips to the corners and your cheeks to the high bones
 - Thrown over and through with a smile that forever
 - wishes and wishes, purple, silent, fled from all the
 - iron things of life, evaded like a sought bandit, gone
 - into dreams, by God.
  - I wonder, Momus,
 - Whether shadows of the dead sit somewhere and look
 - with deep laughter
 - On men who play in terrible earnest the old, known,
 - solemn repetitions of history.
     - A droning monotone soft as sea laughter hovers from
 - your kindliness of bronze,
 - You give me the human ease of a mountain peak, purple,
 - silent;
 - Granite shoulders heaving above the earth curves,
 - Careless eye-witness of the spawning tides of men and
 - women
 - Swarming always in a drift of millions to the dust of toil,
 - the salt of tears,
 - And blood drops of undiminishing war.
      
## THE ANSWER

  - You have spoken the answer.
 - A child searches far sometimes
 - Into the red dust
 -           On a dark rose leaf
 - And so you have gone far
 -           For the answer is:
   -  Silence.
 - In the republic
 - Of the winking stars and spent cataclysms
 - Sure we are it is off there the answer
 - is hidden and folded over,
 - Sleeping in the sun, careless whether
 - it is Sunday or any other day of
 - the week,
  - Knowing silence will bring all one way
 - or another.
  - Have we not seen
 - Purple of the pansy
 -      out of the mulch
 -      and mold
 -      crawl
 -      into a dusk
  -      of velvet?
 -      blur of yellow?
 - Almost we thought from nowwhere but it was
 - the silence,
 -      the future,
 -      working.
      
## TO A DEAD MAN

  - OVER the dead line we have called to you
 - To come across with a word to us,
 - Some beaten whisper of what happens
 - Where you are over the dead line
 - Deaf to our calls and voiceless.
  - The flickering shadows have not answered
 - Nor your lips sent a signal
 - Whether love talks and roses grow
 - And the sun breaks at morning
 - Splattering the sea with crimson.
       
## UNDER

  - I
 - I AM the undertow
 - Washing tides of power
 - Battering the pillars
 - Under your things of high law.
    - II
 - I am a sleepless
 - Slowfaring eater,
 - Maker of rust and rot
 - In your bastioned fastenings,
 - Caissons deep.
    -   III
 - I am the Law
 - Older than you
 - And your builders proud.
    - I am deaf
 - In all days
 - Whether you
 - Say "Yes" or "No".
    - I am the crumbler:
 - To-morrow.
       
## A SPHINX

  - CLOSE-MOUTHED you sat five thousand years and never
 - let out a whisper.
 - Processions came by, marchers, asking questions you
 - answered with grey eyes never blinking, shut lips
 - never talking.
 - Not one croak of anything you know has come from your
 - cat crouch of ages.
 - I am one of those who know all you know and I keep my
 - questions: I know the answers you hold.
      
##   WHO AM I?

  - MY head knocks against the stars.
 - My feet are on the hilltops.
 - My finger-tips are in the valleys and shores of
 - universal life.
 - Down in the sounding foam of primal things I
 - reach my hands and play with pebbles of
 - destiny.
 - I have been to hell and back many times.
 - I know all about heaven, for I have talked with God.
 - I dabble in the blood and guts of the terrible.
 - I know the passionate seizure of beauty
 - And the marvelous rebellion of man at all signs
 - reading "Keep Off."
  - My name is Truth and I am the most elusive captive
 - in the universe.
      
## OUR PRAYER OF THANKS

  - FOR the gladness here where the sun is shining at
 - evening on the weeds at the river,
 - Our prayer of thanks.
  - For the laughter of children who tumble barefooted and
 - bareheaded in the summer grass,
 - Our prayer of thanks.
  - For the sunset and the stars, the women and the white
 - arms that hold us,
 - Our prayer of thanks.
  - God,
 - If you are deaf and blind, if this is all lost to you,
 - God, if the dead in their coffins amid the silver handles
 - on the edge of town, or the reckless dead of war
 - days thrown unknown in pits, if these dead are
 - forever deaf and blind and lost,
 - Our prayer of thanks.
  - God,
 - The game is all your way, the secrets and the signals and
 - the system; and so for the break of the game and
 - the first play and the last.
 - Our prayer of thanks.
       
# FOGS AND FIRES

      
##  AT A WINDOW

  - GIVE me hunger,
 - O you gods that sit and give
 - The world its orders.
 - Give me hunger, pain and want,
 - Shut me out with shame and failure
 - From your doors of gold and fame,
 - Give me your shabbiest, weariest hunger!
  - But leave me a little love,
 - A voice to speak to me in the day end,
 - A hand to touch me in the dark room
 - Breaking the long loneliness.
 - In the dusk of day-shapes
 - Blurring the sunset,
 - One little wandering, western star
 - Thrust out from the changing shores of shadow.
 - Let me go to the window,
 - Watch there the day-shapes of dusk
 - And wait and know the coming
 - Of a little love.
      
## UNDER THE HARVEST MOON

  - UNDER the harvest moon,
 - When the soft silver
 - Drips shimmering
 - Over the garden nights,
 - Death, the gray mocker,
 - Comes and whispers to you
 - As a beautiful friend
 - Who remembers.
  - Under the summer roses
 - When the flagrant crimson
 - Lurks in the dusk
 - Of the wild red leaves,
 - Love, with little hands,
 - Comes and touches you
 - With a thousand memories,
 - And asks you
 - Beautiful, unanswerable questions.
      
## THE GREAT HUNT

  - I CANNOT tell you now;
 - When the wind's drive and whirl
 - Blow me along no longer,
 - And the wind's a whisper at last—
 - Maybe I'll tell you then—
 -                some other time.
  - When the rose's flash to the sunset
 - Reels to the rack and the twist,
 - And the rose is a red bygone,
 - When the face I love is going
 - And the gate to the end shall clang,
 - And it's no use to beckon or say, "So long"—
 - Maybe I'll tell you then—
 -                some other time.
  - I never knew any more beautiful than you:
 - I have hunted you under my thoughts,
 - I have broken down under the wind
 - And into the roses looking for you.
 - I shall never find any
 -                greater than you.
      
## MONOTONE

  - THE monotone of the rain is beautiful,
 - And the sudden rise and slow relapse
 - Of the long multitudinous rain.
  - The sun on the hills is beautiful,
 - Or a captured sunset sea-flung,
 - Bannered with fire and gold.
  - A face I know is beautiful—
 - With fire and gold of sky and sea,
 - And the peace of long warm rain.
      
## JOY

  - LET a joy keep you.
 - Reach out your hands
 - And take it when it runs by,
 - As the Apache dancer
 - Clutches his woman.
 - I have seen them
 - Live long and laugh loud,
 - Sent on singing, singing,
 - Smashed to the heart
 - Under the ribs
 - With a terrible love.
 - Joy always,
 - Joy everywhere—
 - Let joy kill you!
 - Keep away from the little deaths.
      
## SHIRT

  - I REMEMBER once I ran after you and tagged the fluttering
 - shirt of you in the wind.
 - Once many days ago I drank a glassful of something and
 - the picture of you shivered and slid on top of the
 - stuff.
 - And again it was nobody else but you I heard in the
 - singing voice of a careless humming woman.
 - One night when I sat with chums telling stories at a
 - bonfire flickering red embers, in a language its own
 - talking to a spread of white stars:
 -      It was you that slunk laughing
 -      in the clumsy staggering shadows.
 - Broken answers of remembrance let me know you are
 - alive with a peering phantom face behind a doorway
 - somewhere in the city's push and fury
 - Or under a pack of moss and leaves waiting in silence
 - under a twist of oaken arms ready as ever to run
 - away again when I tag the fluttering shirt of you.
      
## AZTEC

  - YOU came from the Aztecs
 - With a copper on your fore-arms
 - Tawnier than a sunset
 - Saying good-by to an even river.
  - And I said, you remember,
 - Those fore-arms of yours
 - Were finer than bronzes
 - And you were glad.
  -           It was tears
 - And a path west
 - and a home-going
 - when I asked
 - Why there were scars of worn gold
 - Where a man's ring was fixed once
 - On your third finger.
 -           And I call you
 - To come back
 - before the days are longer.
      
##   TWO

  - MEMORY of you is . . . a blue spear of flower.
 - I cannot remember the name of it.
 - Alongside a bold dripping poppy is fire and silk.
 -                And they cover you.
      
## BACK YARD

  - SHINE on, O moon of summer.
 - Shine to the leaves of grass, catalpa and oak,
 - All silver under your rain to-night.
  - An Italian boy is sending songs to you to-night from an
 - accordion.
 - A Polish boy is out with his best girl; they marry next
 - month; to-night they are throwing you kisses.
  - An old man next door is dreaming over a sheen that sits
 - in a cherry tree in his back yard.
  - The clocks say I must go—I stay here sitting on the
 - back porch drinking white thoughts you rain down.
  - Shine on, O moon,
 - Shake out more and more silver changes.
      
## ON THE BREAKWATER

  - ON the breakwater in the summer dark, a man and a
 - girl are sitting,
 - She across his knee and they are looking face into face
 - Talking to each other without words, singing rythms in
 - silence to each other.
  - A funnel of white ranges the blue dusk from an out-
 - going boat,
 - Playing its searchlight, puzzled, abrupt, over a streak of
 - green,
 - And two on the breakwater keep their silence, she on his
 - knee.
      
## MASK

  - FLING your red scarf faster and faster, dancer.
 - It is summer and the sun loves a million green leaves,
 - masses of green.
 - Your red scarf flashes across them calling and a-calling.
 - The silk and flare of it is a great soprano leading a
 - chorus
 - Carried along in a rouse of voices reaching for the heart
 - of the world.
 - Your toes are singing to meet the song of your arms:
  - Let the red scarf go swifter.
 - Summer and the sun command you.
      
##   PEARL FOG

  - OPEN the door now.
 - Go roll up the collar of your coat
 - To walk in the changing scarf of mist.
  - Tell your sins here to the pearl fog
 - And know for once a deepening night
 - Strange as the half-meanings
 - Alurk in a wise woman's mousey eyes.
  - Yes, tell your sins
 - And know how careless a pearl fog is
 - Of the laws you have broken.
      
## I SANG

  - I SANG to you and the moon
 - But only the moon remembers.
 - I sang
 - O reckless free-hearted
 - free-throated rythms,
 - Even the moon remembers them
 - And is kind to me.
      
## FOLLIES

  - SHAKEN,
 - The blossoms of lilac,
 - And shattered,
 - The atoms of purple.
 - Green dip the leaves,
 - Darker the bark,
 - Longer the shadows.
  - Sheer lines of poplar
 - Shimmer with masses of silver
 - And down in a garden old with years
 - And broken walls of ruin and story,
 - Roses rise with red rain-memories.
 - May!
 - In the open world
 - The sun comes and finds your face,
 - Remembering all.
      
##  JUNE

  - PAULA is digging and shaping the loam of a salvia,
 - Scarlet Chinese talker of summer.
 - Two petals of crabapple blossom blow fallen in Paula's
 - hair,
 - And fluff of white from a cottonwood.
      
## NOCTURNE IN A DESERTED
 BRICKYARD

  - STUFF of the moon
 - Runs on the lapping sand
 - Out to the longest shadows.
 - Under the curving willows,
 - And round the creep of the wave line,
 - Fluxions of yellow and dusk on the waters
 - Make a wide dreaming pansy of an old pond in the night.
      
## HYDRANGEAS

  - DRAGOONS, I tell you the white hydrangeas
 - turn rust and go soon.
 - Already mid September a line of brown runs
 - over them.
 - One sunset after another tracks the faces, the
 - petals.
 - Waiting, they look over the fence for what
 - way they go.
      
## THEME IN YELLOW

  - I SPOT the hills
 - With yellow balls in autumn.
 - I light the prairie cornfields
 - Orange and tawny gold clusters
 - And I am called pumpkins.
 - On the last of October
 - When dusk is fallen
 - Children join hands
 - And circle round me
 - Singing ghost songs
 - And love to the harvest moon;
 - I am a jack-o'-lantern
 - With terrible teeth
 - And the children know
 - I am fooling.
      
##  BETWEEN TWO HILLS

  - BETWEEN two hills
 - The old town stands.
 - The houses loom
 - And the roofs and trees
 - And the dusk and the dark,
 - The damp and the dew
 - Are there.
  - The prayers are said
 - And the people rest
 - For sleep is there
 - And the touch of dreams
 - Is over all.
      
## LAST ANSWERS

  - I WROTE a poem on the mist
 - And a woman asked me what I meant by it.
 - I had thought till then only of the beauty of the mist,
 - how pearl and gray of it mix and reel,
 - And change the drab shanties with lighted lamps at evening
 - into points of mystery quivering with color.
  - I answered:
 - The whole world was mist once long ago and some day
 - it will all go back to mist,
 - Our skulls and lungs are more water than bone and
 - tissue
 - And all poets love dust and mist because all the last
 - answers
 - Go running back to dust and mist.
      
## WINDOW

  - NIGHT from a railroad car window
 - Is a great, dark, soft thing
 - Broken across with slashes of light.
      
## YOUNG SEA

  - THE sea is never still.
 - It pounds on the shore
 - Restless as a young heart,
 - Hunting.
  - The sea speaks
 - And only the stormy hearts
 - Know what it says:
 - It is the face
 - of a rough mother speaking.
  - The sea is young.
 - One storm cleans all the hoar
 - And loosens the age of it.
 - I hear it laughing, reckless.
  - They love the sea,
 - Men who ride on it
 - And know they will die
 - Under the salt of it
  - Let only the young come,
 - Says the sea.
    - Let them kiss my face
 - And hear me.
 - I am the last word
 - And I tell
 - Where storms and stars come from.
      
## BONES

  - SLING me under the sea.
 - Pack me down in the salt and wet.
 - No farmer's plow shall touch my bones.
 - No Hamlet hold my jaws and speak
 - How jokes are gone and empty is my mouth.
 - Long, green-eyed scavengers shall pick my eyes,
 - Purple fish play hide-and-seek,
 - And I shall be song of thunder, crash of sea,
 - Down on the floors of salt and wet.
 - Sling me . . . under the sea.
      
## PALS

  - TAKE a hold now
 - On the silver handles here,
 - Six silver handles,
 - One for each of his old pals.
  - Take hold
 - And lift him down the stairs,
 - Put him on the rollers
 - Over the floor of the hearse.
  - Take him on the last haul,
 - To the cold straight house,
 - The level even house,
 - To the last house of all.
  - The dead say nothing
 - And the dead know much
 - And the dead hold under their tongues
 - A locked-up story.
      
## CHILD

  - THE young child, Christ, is straight and wise
 - And asks questions of the old men, questions
 - Found under running water for all children
 - And found under shadows thrown on still waters
 - By tall trees looking downward, old and gnarled.
 - Found to the eyes of children alone, untold,
 - Singing a low song in the loneliness.
 - And the young child, Christ, goes on asking
 - And the old men answer nothing and only know love
 - For the young child. Christ, straight and wise.
      
## POPPIES

  - SHE loves blood-red poppies for a garden to walk in.
 - In a loose white gown she walks
 - and a new child tugs at cords in her body.
 - Her head to the west at evening when the dew is creeping,
 - A shudder of gladness runs in her bones and torsal fiber:
 - She loves blood-red poppies for a garden to walk in.
      
## CHILD MOON

  - THE child's wonder
 - At the old moon
 - Comes back nightly.
 - She points her finger
 - To the far silent yellow thing
 - Shining through the branches
 - Filtering on the leaves a golden sand,
 - Crying with her little tongue, "See the moon!"
 - And in her bed fading to sleep
 - With babblings of the moon on her little mouth.
      
## MARGARET

  - MANY birds and the beating of wings
 - Make a flinging reckless hum
 - In the early morning at the rocks
 - Above the blue pool
 - Where the gray shadows swim lazy.
  - In your blue eyes, O reckless child,
 - I saw today many little wild wishes,
 - Eager as the great morning.
       
# SHADOWS

    
## POEMS DONE ON A LATE NIGHT CAR

  -  I. CHICKENS
 - I AM The Great White Way of the city:
 - When you ask what is my desire, I answer:
 - "Girls fresh as country wild flowers,
 - With young faces tired of the cows and barns,
 - Eager in their eyes as the dawn to find my mysteries,
 - Slender supple girls with shapely legs,
 - Lure in the arch of their little shoulders
 - And wisdom from the prairies to cry only softly at
 - the ashes of my mysteries."
    -  II. USED UP
 - *Lines based on certain regrets that come with rumination 
upon the painted faces of women on 
North Clark Street, Chicago*
   -      Roses,
 -    Red roses,
 -      Crushed
 - In the rain and wind
 - Like mouths of women
 - Beaten by the fists of
 - Men using them.
 - O little roses
 - And broken leaves
 - And petal wisps:
 - You that so flung your crimson
 - To the sun
 - Only yesterday.
     -   III. HOME
 - Here is a thing my heart wishes the world had more of:
 - I heard it in the air of one night when I listened
 - To a mother singing softly to a child restless and angry
 - in the darkness.
      
##  IT IS MUCH

  - WOMEN of night life amid the lights
 - Where the line of your full, round throats
 - Matches in gleam the glint of your eyes
 - And the ring of your heart-deep laughter:
 - It is much to be warm and sure of to-morrow.
  - Women of night life along the shadows,
 - Lean at your throats and skulking the walls,
 - Gaunt as a bitch worn to the bone,
 - Under the paint of your smiling faces:
 - It is much to be warm and sure of to-morrow.
      
##  TRAFFICKER

  - AMONG the shadows where two streets cross,
 - A woman lurks in the dark and waits
 - To move on when a policeman heaves in view.
 - Smiling a broken smile from a face
 - Painted over haggard bones and desperate eyes,
 - All night she offers passers-by what they will
 - Of her beauty wasted, body faded, claims gone,
 - And no takers.
      
## HARRISON STREET COURT

  - I HEARD a woman's lips
 - Speaking to a companion
 - Say these words:
  - "A woman what hustles
 - Never keeps nothin'
 - For all her hustlin'.
 - Somebody always gets
 - What she goes on the street for.
 - If it ain't a pimp
 - It's a bull what gets it.
 - I been hustlin' now
 - Till I ain't much good any more.
 - I got nothin' to show for it.
 - Some man got it all,
 - Every night's hustlin' I ever did."
      
##  SOILED DOVE

  - LET us be honest; the lady was not a harlot until she
 - married a corporation lawyer who picked her from
 - a Ziegfeld chorus.
 - Before then she never took anybody's money and paid
 - for her silk stockings out of what she earned singing
 - and dancing.
 - She loved one man and he loved six women and the
 - game was changing her looks, calling for more and
 - more massage money and high coin for the beauty
 - doctors.
 - Now she drives a long, underslung motor car all by herself,
 - reads in the day's papers what her husband is
 - doing to the inter-state commerce commission, requires
 - a larger corsage from year to year, and wonders
 - sometimes how one man is coming along with
 - six women.
      
## JUNGHEIMER'S

  - IN western fields of corn and northern timber lands,
 - They talk about me, a saloon with a soul,
 - The soft red lights, the long curving bar,
 - The leather seats and dim corners,
 - Tall brass spittoons, a nigger cutting ham,
 - And the painting of a woman half-dressed thrown reckless
 - across a bed after a night of booze and riots.
      
##  GONE

  - EVERYBODY loved Chick Lorimer in our town.
 -           Far off
 -      Everybody loved her.
 - So we all love a wild girl keeping a hold
 - On a dream she wants.
 - Nobody knows now where Chick Lorimer went.
 - Nobody knows why she packed her trunk. . a few
 - old things
 - And is gone,
 -           Gone with her little chin
 -           Thrust ahead of her
 -           And her soft hair blowing careless
 -           From under a wide hat,
 - Dancer, singer, a laughing passionate lover.
  - Were there ten men or a hundred hunting Chick?
 - Were there five men or fifty with aching hearts?
 -      Everybody loved Chick Lorimer.
 -           Nobody knows where she's gone.
       
#  OTHER DAYS
 (1900-1910)

     
## DREAMS IN THE DUSK

  - DREAMS in the dusk,
 - Only dreams closing the day
 - And with the day's close going back
 - To the gray things, the dark things,
 - The far, deep things of dreamland.
  - Dreams, only dreams in the dusk,
 - Only the old remembered pictures
 - Of lost days when the day's loss
 - Wrote in tears the heart's loss.
  - Tears and loss and broken dreams
 - May find your heart at dusk.
      
##  DOCKS

  - STROLLING along
 - By the teeming docks,
 - I watch the ships put out.
 - Black ships that heave and lunge
 - And move like mastodons
 - Arising from lethargic sleep.
  - The fathomed harbor
 - Calls them not nor dares
 - Them to a strain of action,
 - But outward, on and outward,
 - Sounding low-reverberating calls,
 - Shaggy in the half-lit distance,
 - They pass the pointed headland,
 - View the wide, far-lifting wilderness
 - And leap with cumulative speed
 - To test the challenge of the sea.
  - Plunging,
 - Doggedly onward plunging,
 - Into salt and mist and foam and sun.
      
## ALL DAY LONG

  - ALL day long in fog and wind,
 - The waves have flung their beating crests
 - Against the palisades of adamant.
 - My boy, he went to sea, long and long ago,
 - Curls of brown were slipping underneath his cap,
 - He looked at me from blue and steely eyes;
 - Natty, straight and true, he stepped away,
 - My boy, he went to sea.
 - All day long in fog and wind,
 - The waves have flung their beating crests
 - Against the palisades of adamant.
      
## WAITING

  - TODAY I will let the old boat stand
 - Where the sweep of the harbor tide comes in
 - To the pulse of a far, deep-steady sway.
 - And I will rest and dream and sit on the deck
 - Watching the world go by
 - And take my pay for many hard days gone I remember.
  - I will choose what clouds I like
 - In the great white fleets that wander the blue
 - As I lie on my back or loaf at the rail.
 - And I will listen as the veering winds kiss me and fold me
 - And put on my brow the touch of the world's great will.
  - Daybreak will hear the heart of the boat beat,
 - Engine throb and piston play
 - In the quiver and leap at call of life.
 - To-morrow we move in the gaps and heights
 - On changing floors of unlevel seas
 - And no man shall stop us and no man follow
 - For ours is the quest of an unknown shore
 - And we are husky and lusty and shouting-gay.
        
## FROM THE SHORE

  - A LONE gray bird,
 - Dim-dipping, far-flying,
 - Alone in the shadows and grandeurs and tumults
 - Of night and the sea
 - And the stars and storms.
  - Out over the darkness it wavers and hovers,
 - Out into the gloom it swings and batters,
 - Out into the wind and the rain and the vast,
 - Out into the pit of a great black world,
 - Where fogs are at battle, sky-driven, sea-blown,
 - Love of mist and rapture of flight,
 - Glories of chance and hazards of death
 - On its eager and palpitant wings.
  - Out into the deep of the great dark world,
 - Beyond the long borders where foam and drift
 - Of the sundering waves are lost and gone
 - On the tides that plunge and rear and crumble.
       
## UPLANDS IN MAY

  - WONDER as of old things
 - Fresh and fair come back
 - Hangs over pasture and road.
 - Lush in the lowland grasses rise
 - And upland beckons to upland.
 - The great strong hills are humble.
      
##  DREAM GIRL

  - YOU will come one day in a waver of love,
 - Tender as dew, impetuous as rain,
 - The tan of the sun will be on your skin,
 - The purr of the breeze in your murmuring speech,
 - You will pose with a hill-flower grace.
  - You will come, with your slim, expressive arms,
 - A poise of the head no sculptor has caught
 - And nuances spoken with shoulder and neck,
 - Your face in a pass-and-repass of moods
 - As many as skies in delicate change
 - Of cloud and blue and flimmering sun.
  -           Yet,
 - You may not come, O girl of a dream,
 - We may but pass as the world goes by
 - And take from a look of eyes into eyes,
 - A film of hope and a memoried day.
      
## PLOWBOY

  - AFTER the last red sunset glimmer,
 - Black on the line of a low hill rise,
 - Formed into moving shadows, I saw
 - A plowboy and two horses lined against the gray,
 - Plowing in the dusk the last furrow.
 - The turf had a gleam of brown,
 - And smell of soil was in the air,
 - And, cool and moist, a haze of April.
  - I shall remember you long,
 - Plowboy and horses against the sky in shadow.
 - I shall remember you and the picture
 - You made for me,
 - Turning the turf in the dusk
 - And haze of an April gloaming.
      
##   BROADWAY

  - I SHALL never forget you, Broadway
 - Your golden and calling lights.
  - I'll remember you long,
 - Tall-walled river of rush and play.
  - Hearts that know you hate you
 - And lips that have given you laughter
 - Have gone to their ashes of life and its roses,
 - Cursing the dreams that were lost
 - In the dust of your harsh and trampled stones.
      
## OLD WOMAN

  - THE owl-car clatters along, dogged by the echo
 - From building and battered paving-stone.
 - The headlight scoffs at the mist,
 - And fixes its yellow rays in the cold slow rain;
 - Against a pane I press my forehead
 - And drowsily look on the walls and sidewalks.
  - The headlight finds the way
 - And life is gone from the wet and the welter—
 - Only an old woman, bloated, disheveled and bleared.
 - Far-wandered waif of other days,
 - Huddles for sleep in a doorway,
 - Homeless.
      
## NOON HOUR

  - SHE sits in the dust at the walls
 - And makes cigars,
 - Bending at the bench
 - With fingers wage-anxious,
 - Changing her sweat for the day's pay.
  - Now the noon hour has come,
 - And she leans with her bare arms
 - On the window-sill over the river,
 - Leans and feels at her throat
 - Cool-moving things out of the free open ways:
  - At her throat and eyes and nostrils
 - The touch and the blowing cool
 - Of great free ways beyond the walls.
      
##  'BOES

  - I WAITED today for a freight train to pass.
 - Cattle cars with steers butting their horns against the
 - bars, went by.
 - And a half a dozen hoboes stood on bumpers between
 - cars.
 - Well, the cattle are respectable, I thought.
 - Every steer has its transportation paid for by the farmer
 - sending it to market,
 - While the hoboes are law-breakers in riding a railroad
 - train without a ticket.
 - It reminded me of ten days I spent in the Allegheny
 - County jail in Pittsburgh.
 - I got ten days even though I was a veteran of the
 - Spanish-American war.
 - Cooped in the same cell with me was an old man, a
 - bricklayer and a booze-fighter.
 - But it just happened he, too, was a veteran soldier, and
 - he had fought to preserve the Union and free the
 - niggers.
 - We were three in all, the other being a Lithuanian who
 - got drunk on pay day at the steel works and got to
 - fighting a policeman;
 - All the clothes he had was a shirt, pants and shoes—
 - somebody got his hat and coat and what money he
 - had left over when he got drunk.
       
## UNDER A TELEPHONE POLE

  - I AM a copper wire slung in the air,
 - Slim against the sun I make not even a clear line of shadow.
 - Night and day I keep singing—humming and thrumming:
 - It is love and war and money; it is the fighting and the
 - tears, the work and want,
 - Death and laughter of men and women passing through
 - me, carrier of your speech,
 - In the rain and the wet dripping, in the dawn and the
 - shine drying,
 -      A copper wire.
      
## I AM THE PEOPLE, THE MOB

  - I AM the people—the mob—the crowd—the mass.
 - Do you know that all the great work of the world is
 - done through me?
 - I am the workingman, the inventor, the maker of the
 - world's food and clothes.
 - I am the audience that witnesses history. The Napoleons
 - come from me and the Lincolns. They die. And
 - then I send forth more Napoleons and Lincolns.
 - I am the seed ground. I am a prairie that will stand
 - for much plowing. Terrible storms pass over me.
 - I forget. The best of me is sucked out and wasted.
 - I forget. Everything but Death comes to me and
 - makes me work and give up what I have. And I
 - forget.
 - Sometimes I growl, shake myself and spatter a few red
 - drops for history to remember. Then—I forget.
 - When I, the People, learn to remember, when I, the
 - People, use the lessons of yesterday and no longer
 - forget who robbed me last year, who played me for
 - a fool—then there will be no speaker in all the world
 - say the name: "The People," with any fleck of a
 - sneer in his voice or any far-off smile of derision.
 - The mob—the crowd—the mass—will arrive then.
      
##  GOVERNMENT

  - THE Government—I heard about the Government and
 - I went out to find it. I said I would look closely at
 - it when I saw it.
 - Then I saw a policeman dragging a drunken man to
 - the callaboose. It was the Government in action.
 - I saw a ward alderman slip into an office one morning
 - and talk with a judge. Later in the day the judge
 - dismissed a case against a pickpocket who was a
 - live ward worker for the alderman. Again I saw
 - this was the Government, doing things.
 - I saw militiamen level their rifles at a crowd of
 - workingmen who were trying to get other workingmen
 - to stay away from a shop where there was a strike
 - on. Government in action.
  - Everywhere I saw that Government is a thing made of
 - men, that Government has blood and bones, it is
 - many mouths whispering into many ears, sending
 - telegrams, aiming rifles, writing orders, saying
 - "yes" and "no."
  - Government dies as the men who form it die and are laid
 - away in their graves and the new Government that
 - comes after is human, made of heartbeats of blood,
  - ambitions, lusts, and money running through it all,
 - money paid and money taken, and money covered
 - up and spoken of with hushed voices.
 - A Government is just as secret and mysterious and sensitive
 - as any human sinner carrying a load of germs,
 - traditions and corpuscles handed down from
 - fathers and mothers away back.
      
##   LANGUAGES

  - THERE are no handles upon a language
 - Whereby men take hold of it
 - And mark it with signs for its remembrance.
 - It is a river, this language,
 - Once in a thousand years
 - Breaking a new course
 - Changing its way to the ocean.
 - It is mountain effluvia
 - Moving to valleys
 - And from nation to nation
 - Crossing borders and mixing.
 - Languages die like rivers.
 - Words wrapped round your tongue today
 - And broken to shape of thought
 - Between your teeth and lips speaking
 - Now and today
 - Shall be faded hieroglyphics
 - Ten thousand years from now.
 - Sing—and singing—remember
 - Your song dies and changes
 - And is not here to-morrow
 - Any more than the wind
 - Blowing ten thousand years ago.
       
## LETTERS TO DEAD IMAGISTS

  - Emily Dickinson:
 - You gave us the bumble bee who has a soul,
 - The everlasting traveler among the hollyhocks,
 - And how God plays around a back yard garden.
  - Stevie Crane:
 - War is kind and we never knew the kindness of war till
 - you came;
 - Nor the black riders and clashes of spear and shield out
 - of the sea,
 - Nor the mumblings and shots that rise from dreams on
 - call.
      
##  SHEEP

  - Thousands of sheep, soft-footed, black-nosed sheep—
 - one by one going up the hill and over the fence—one by
 - one four-footed pattering up and over—one by one wiggling
 - their stub tails as they take the short jump and go
 - over—one by one silently unless for the multitudinous
 - drumming of their hoofs as they move on and go over—
 - thousands and thousands of them in the grey haze of
 - evening just after sundown—one by one slanting in a
 - long line to pass over the hill—
  - I am the slow, long-legged Sleepyman and I love you
 - sheep in Persia, California, Argentine, Australia, or
 - Spain—you are the thoughts that help me when I, the
 - Sleepyman, lay my hands on the eyelids of the children
 - of the world at eight o'clock every night—you thousands
 - and thousands of sheep in a procession of dusk making
 - an endless multitudinous drumming on the hills with
 - your hoofs.
       
##  THE RED SON

  - I LOVE your faces I saw the many years
 - I drank your milk and filled my mouth
 - With your home talk, slept in your house
 - And was one of you.
 - But a fire burns in my heart.
 - Under the ribs where pulses thud
 - And flitting between bones of skull
 - Is the push, the endless mysterious command,
 - Saying:
 - "I leave you behind—
 - You for the little hills and the years all alike,
 - You with your patient cows and old houses
 - Protected from the rain,
 - I am going away and I never come back to you;
 - Crags and high rough places call me,
 - Great places of death
 - Where men go empty handed
 - And pass over smiling
 - To the star-drift on the horizon rim.
 - My last whisper shall be alone, unknown;
 - I shall go to the city and fight against it,
 - And make it give me passwords
 - Of luck and love, women worth dying for,
 - And money.
  - I go where you wist not of
 - Nor I nor any man nor woman.
 - I only know I go to storms
 - Grappling against things wet and naked."
 - There is no pity of it and no blame.
 - None of us is in the wrong.
 - After all it is only this:
 - You for the little hills and I go away.
      
##   THE MIST

  - I AM the mist, the impalpable mist,
 - Back of the thing you seek.
 - My arms are long,
 - Long as the reach of time and space.
  - Some toil and toil, believing,
 - Looking now and again on my face,
 - Catching a vital, olden glory.
  - But no one passes me,
 - I tangle and snare them all.
 - I am the cause of the Sphinx,
 - The voiceless, baffled, patient Sphinx.
  - I was at the first of things,
 - I will be at the last.
 - I am the primal mist
 - And no man passes me;
 - My long impalpable arms
 - Bar them all.
      
## THE JUNK MAN

  - I AM glad God saw Death
 - And gave Death a job taking care of all who are tired
 - of living:
  - When all the wheels in a clock are worn and slow and
 - the connections loose
 - And the clock goes on ticking and telling the wrong time
 - from hour to hour
 - And people around the house joke about what a bum
 - clock it is,
 - How glad the clock is when the big Junk Man drives
 - his wagon
 - Up to the house and puts his arms around the clock and
 - says:
 - "You don't belong here,
 - You gotta come
 - Along with me,"
 - How glad the clock is then, when it feels the arms of the
 - Junk Man close around it and carry it away.
      
## SILVER NAILS

  - A MAN was crucified. He came to the city a stranger,
 - was accused, and nailed to a cross. He lingered hanging.
 - Laughed at the crowd. "The nails are iron," he
 - said, "You are cheap. In my country when we crucify
 - we use silver nails. . ." So he went jeering. They
 - did not understand him at first. Later they talked about
 - him in changed voices in the saloons, bowling alleys, and
 - churches. It came over them every man is crucified
 - only once in his life and the law of humanity dictates
 - silver nails be used for the job. A statue was erected
 - to him in a public square. Not having gathered his
 - name when he was among them, they wrote him as John
 - Silvernail on the statue.
      
##  GYPSY

  - I ASKED a gypsy pal
 - To imitate an old image
 - And speak old wisdom.
 - She drew in her chin,
 - Made her neck and head
 - The top piece of a Nile obelisk
 - and said:
 - Snatch off the gag from thy mouth, child,
 - And be free to keep silence.
 - Tell no man anything for no man listens,
 - Yet hold thy lips ready to speak.
