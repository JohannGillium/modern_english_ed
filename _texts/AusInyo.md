# INYO

  - FAR from the northward, from the cloven ridges,
 -    Pine-girt, deep-drifted with bewildering snows,
 - By ice-plowed gorge, the leaping river bridges,
 -    Light span by span, from lake to lake below,
 - By mountain meadow, and the snow-fed hollow
 -    Where birch and buckthorn thicket mark the trail,
 - Spurning the tawny hills in haste to follow
 -    The long, brown reaches of a desert vale.
  - To east and west roll up the purple ranges,
 -    Foot bound about by leopard-colored hills;
 - From east to west their serrate shadow changes;
 -    From west to east stream down the tumbling rills.
 - Mocking the shadeless slopes and sullen ledges,
 -    Through the sunburnt wastes of sage and yellow sand,
 - Run down to meet thy willows and thy sedges,—
 -    O lonely river in a lonely land!
  - Foamless and swift thy winding waters follow
 -    To find, unbosomed to the wind-swept skies,
 - The great lake lapping in a tideless hollow,
 -    Wanton to each day's changes as they rise,—
 - Purpling to meet the splendor of their mornings,
 -    Paling to catch their tender mid-day blue,
 - Trembling alike to smilings and to scornings,—
 -    Fleet light of loves, it cannot hold one true.
  - Like some great lioness beside the river,
 -    With passion slumbering in her half-shut eyes,
 - Watching the light from heated sands up-quiver,
 -    Untamed and barren, lone the valley lies.
 - Forego, O River, all the wrong you do her,
 -    Hasting your waters to the bitter lake,
 - Rise from your reedy marges and subdue her,
 -    So shall the land be fertile for your sake.
   *Mary Austin.*
