#  THE WELL CRADLE
 (*Izutsu*: a woman play) 

            *The Well Cradle* is a most delicate play, like a fresh-water version of *Pining      Wind*. Quite naturally the last lines speak of 'the plaintain leaf dream': a plantain       (*bashō*) leaf is enormously long and graceful, but it tears into tatters in      the wind. 

       It is the play's mood of childlike innocence that encourages the translation of the title.      The railing around the mouth of a well is not normally a 'well cradle' in English, but however       *izutsu* is translated, it must sound pleasing. The key poem of the play makes of this      word almost a chant as it begins, *Tsutsu izutsu izutsu no. . .* ('Cradle well cradle      well cradle that. . .'). In context, the music of these sounds is wonderfully fresh and lovely. 

       The poem itself is by Ariwara no Narihira (825-880), and the story of Narihira and of a lady      known only as Ki no Aritsune's daughter is told in a chapter of the *Ise monogatari*.      Each chapter of the *Ise monogatari* starts with the words *Mukashi otoko. . .*      ('A man of old. . .'). Hence Narihira, who is thought to be the hero of the whole romance,      acquired these words as a nickname. Narihira, like Komachi, was one of the Six Immortals of      Poetry of his time, and the preface to the *Kokinshū* appraises him as      follows: 'Ariwara no Narihira has too much heart and too few words. He is like a withered      flower whose color is gone but whose fragrance lingers.' 

       There are several places in *The Well Cradle* where 'long ago' and 'now' are      suggestively juxtaposed, as they are, for example, in *Mouth-of-Sound*. The Sideman,      too, speaks of turning his sleeves back, or inside out: this is a device to bring on a dream      vision, especially one of the past. But *The Well Cradle* stops carefully short of the      climax of *Pining Wind*. The Lady of the Well Cradle does not mistake the face she sees      in the well for flesh, even though the vision is deeply moving, Phantom she is, but her      appearing and her disappearing are subtle indeed. 

       The Buddha the Lady prays to at the beginning of *The Well Cradle* is Amida, whose      vow is to save all weak and sinful beings from suffering. His Pure Land Paradise is in the      West. To one who has faith in his all-saving grace, Amida, the Lord of Infinite Light, offers a      five-colored cord by which the soul can be drawn into the Pure Land. A dying believer would      often be given such a cord to hold; the other end would be attached to Amida's hand in an icon      representing Amida's welcome to the soul. He would be shown rising like the full moon over      mountains, attended by a pair of Bodhisattvas; or again, he might be seen coming straight      toward the believer, attended as before and riding on a cloud. 

                                  * A well cradle, that is to say, the railing surrounding the mouth of a well, stands down      front; to it are fastened a few plumed stalks of pampas grass. *       NANORI-BUE 

      * Sideman enters and stands at main spot facing front. *        NANORI

                 Sideman:        I'm a brother who's taking a look at all lands. These few days past I've been in the       Southern Capital. Now, though, I mean to visit Hatsuse. When I inquired about the temple       before me here, I was told it's called Ariwara Temple. So I think I'll go up to it and have a       look.

                 Sideman:              *               * Just as I'm resting and clearing my heart at the temple here, a very lovely lady       draws water from the well in the yard and gives it as an offering. It seems she's bringing       comfort to this grave mound. Who are you, pray? 

                            Doer:        I live nearby. Ariwara no Narihira, whose vow founded this temple, left to the world his       name; and the mark of his shade, they say, lies under this mound. I myself know little about       him, but I do look after him so, by offering flowers and water.

       - was dubbed
       - a Man of Old; 
       - and now,
       - far removed in time,
       - one hardly could have with him 
       - link or tie.

       -  headdress, his cloak, 
       - hide the woman, 
       -  show me a man! 
       - Narihira's face
                         UTA
 on-w 

                 Doer:              - I see; 
       - how I miss him! 
                 * Step by step she backs away from the well, hiding tears. *                 Chorus:              - Oh, in spite of me, 
       -  I miss him! 
       -  Dead lover
       - in phantom form, 
       - a flower withered,
             * She sits dejectedly before drums, then almost immediately stands again; she listens to       bell, stamps beat. *              -  all hue gone 
       -  but fragrant
       -  yet Ariwara 
       - Temple bell
       - gently, gently 
       - tolls in dawn; 
             * Pointing her folded fan in front of her, she comes down to edge of stage near Sideman's       spot, then returns to main spot, stamps beat. *              - ah, pining wind 
       -  at the old shrine! 
       -  a plantain leaf 
       - dream breaks 
       - to waking 
       - dream breaks 
       - into dawn. 
                 * Having opened toward front, she now turns to side and stamps final beat. *
