# EXILED TO SIBERIA.  
  BY COUNT LEON TOLSTOI.

    "God knows the truth, but he does not at once make it  manifest."

         IN the city of Vladimir lived a young merchant named Askenov.   He owned two stores and a dwelling-house.

         Askenov was attractive in person, blonde, curly-headed, and a  lover of jollity and song.  He drank in his youth, and when  intoxicated he quarreled.  But when once married he drank very  rarely.

         One day in summer he decided to attend the fair at Nijni-Novogorod.  As he was bidding his family farewell, his wife said to  him:

         "Ivan, do not go to-day; I had a bad dream about you."

         Askenov began to laugh, and replied:

         "You fear I will commit some folly at the fair."

         His wife answered: "I do not myself exactly know what I fear;  only I had a bad dream.  I saw you as you came from the city.  You  took off your cap, and all at once I saw that your head was quite  white."

       Askenov began to laugh more cheerily still.  "Ah well! it is  a good sign," he said.  "I shall do a good business, and will bring  you a beautiful present."

       So he took leave of his family and departed.       Midway in his journey he met an acquaintance, a merchant, with  whom he lodged that night.  They drank tea together, and went to  sleep in adjoining rooms.

       Askenov was not a heavy sleeper.  He awoke in the middle of  the night, and, to travel more comfortably in the coolness of the  morning, aroused the postilion, and ordered him to put the horses  before the wagon.  Then he entered the dim office, paid the  landlord, and went away.

       After having traveled forty miles, he stopped again to feed  the horses, rested himself at the hotel, went out upon the door-step and had his samovar prepared.  He took a guitar and began to  play.  All at once a * troika* with its gong arrives.  A state  functionary with two soldiers descends, approaches Askenov, and  inquires of him who he is and whither he is going.  Askenov excuses  himself from replying, but asks him to take some tea.  The  official, however, continues to press his questions.  Where had he  slept the night before?  Was he alone with the merchant?  Why had  he left the inn so precipitantly?

       Askenov, surprised by these interrogatories, related what had  taken place, then said: "Why do you ask me so many questions?  I am  neither a thief nor a brigand.  I am traveling on my own business,  and no one has a right to question me."

       The official then called his soldiers and replied: "I am a  police commissioner, and if I question you it is because the  merchant with whom you passed the night was murdered.  Show your  baggage—and you others, search it."

       They entered the hotel-office, took his trunk and satchel,  opened them, and in the latter found a knife.

       The officer exclaimed, "Whose is this knife?"       Askenov turned to look, saw a blade covered with blood, and  became terror-stricken.

       "And why this blood on the knife?"

       Askenov tried to reply, but he could not utter a word.

       "I—I do not know—I—  A knife—I—  It is not mine," he  stammered at last.

       The police commissioner said: "This morning the merchant was  found murdered in bed.  No one except yourself could have committed  the crime.  The rooms were locked from the inside, and within was  no one but you and he.  Moreover, a knife covered with blood has  been found in your bag.  Besides, your crime can be read in your  face.  Confess at once how you killed him, and how much money you  stole."

       Askenov called God to witness that he was not guilty; that he  had not seen the merchant after having taken tea with him; that he  had only his own money, eight thousand roubles, and that the knife  was not his.   But his voice was husky, his face had become  pale, and he trembled like a criminal.

       The officer called his soldiers, and ordered them to bind him  and place him in the carriage.  When they had done so, Askenov,  with his feet in irons, crossed himself and began to weep.  They  took away all his effects, with his money, and put him in prison in  the neighboring city.

       An inquest was held at Vladimir.  All the merchants and  inhabitants declared that Askenov, though he had been in the habit  of drinking and amusing himself when a young man, was regarded as  an honorable person.  Then the matter came before the courts.  He  was accused of having murdered the merchant Riazan, and of having  robbed him of twenty thousand roubles.

       His wife was in despair, and knew not what to think.  Her  children were all small, one of them still at the breast.  She took  them all with her, and went to the city where her husband was  imprisoned.  At first they refused to let her see him; but as she  insisted, she was allowed that privilege.  When she saw him in his  prison clothes, shackled, mingling with robbers, she fell to the  ground, and some time passed before she came to herself again.   Then she gathered her children about her, seated herself by  Askenov's side, told him of what was going on at home, and asked  him to relate how his misfortune had come about.  He told her all,  and she asked:

       "What is to be done now?"

       "We must supplicate the Czar," he replied; "for it can not be  that the innocent should be punished."

       His wife then told him that she had already sent a petition to  the Czar; "but it could not have been sent to him," she said.

       Askenov made no reply, and remained overwhelmed.

       His wife said: "My dream was not in vain.  Do you remember it?   I saw you with white hair.  It will now become white with grief.   You ought not to have gone that time."

       She began to stroke his hair with her hand, and said:

       "My dear Ivan, speak the truth to your wife.  Was it not you  who killed him?"

       "Askenov replied: "And you, also, think so!"  He hid his face  in his hands and wept.

       A soldier appeared.  He told the wife and children that it was  time for them to go, and Askenov bade his family farewell for the  last time.

       When his wife was gone he mentally reviewed his conversation  with her.  Recollecting that she also had asked him if he had not  murdered the merchant, he said to himself: "God alone knows the  truth.  Him I must implore.  I will await his mercy."  And from  that moment he ceased to ask for human aid, lifted up his soul in  hope, and prayed continually to God.

       Askenov was sentenced to the knout, and then to hard labor for  life.  The sentence was carried out.  He was beaten with the knout,  and when his wounds were healed they sent him, with other life  convicts, to Siberia.

       There Askenov remained at hard labor for twenty-six years.   His hair became white as snow, and his long gray beard hung limply  from his face.  All his gayety disappeared.  He began to stoop and  to lag in his gait.  He spoke but little, and never laughed.  He  frequently prayed to God.

       In prison he learned to make shoes, and with the money thus  earned bought a book of martyrs, which he read when there was light  in his dungeon.  On festal days he attended the prison chapel, read  the Apostles, and sang in the choir.  He never lost his beautiful  voice.  The officials loved him for his docility; his companions  held him in high regard, called him "grandfather" and "man of God."   When the convicts demanded any thing, it was always Askenov who was  made to present their request.  When the prisoners quarreled, it  was again Askenov whom they chose as arbitrator.  No one wrote him  from home, and Askenov knew not whether his wife and children were  still living.

       One day new convicts were taken to the prison.  In the evening  the old ones asked of the new from what cities or villages they  came, and for what causes.  Askenov also approached, and with  inclined head listened to what was said.  One of the new convicts  was an old man of sixty years, tall in stature, and with a gray,  trimmed beard.  He related the reasons for his doom.

       "It is thus, my brothers," he said, "they have sent me here  for nothing.  I detached a horse from a sleigh; they seized me,  saying   I stole it.  And I—I replied: 'I only wished to  travel more rapidly; you see indeed that I have let the horse  loose.  No crime has been committed.'  'No,' they said; 'you have  stolen it,' but they knew neither where nor when I had stolen it.   To be sure I was guilty of misdeeds, which ought to have sent me  here long before, but they could never surprise me in the act.  And  now they have brought me here contrary to all law.  Now, listen.   I have already been in Siberia.  But I did not remain here long."

       "Whence do you come?" asked one of the convicts.

       "I am from the city of Vladimir.  I am a small shopkeeper of  that place.  My name is Makar."

       Askenov raised his head and asked: "Have you not heard the  merchant Askenov spoken of at Vladimir?  Are they still alive?"

       "Why, to be sure.  But they are rich merchants, although their  father is in Siberia: he must have sinned like the rest of us."

       Askenov did not like to speak on the subject of his  misfortune.  He sighed and said: "It is for my sins that I have  been in prison twenty-six years."

       Makar asked, "For what sins?"

       "I merit my punishment," responded Askenov, simply.

       He would say nothing more.  But the other convicts related to  the newly-arrived why Askenov found himself in Siberia; how some  one, during the journey, had murdered the merchant and placed a  bloody knife among Askenov's baggage; and how, by reason of that,  he had been unjustly condemned.

       In hearing this, Makar cast a glance upon Askenov, struck his  knees with his hands, and exclaimed:

       "Oh, what a wonder!  This is a miracle.  Ah, you have grown  quite old, grandfather!"

       They asked why he was so astonished; where he had seen  Askenov.  But Makar did not reply; he merely said: "It is a  miracle, brothers, that fate has re-united us here."

       These expressions convinced Askenov that this man must be the  assassin, and he said to him: "Have you heard this affair spoken of  before, Maker [sic]; or have you indeed seen me elsewhere than  here?"

       "What?  I have heard it spoken of.  The earth is full of  ears.[^]: A Russian proverb.

      But it is a long time since that affair took place, and I  have forgotten the particulars they told me."  

   "Perhaps you learned who killed the merchant?" asked Askenov.

       Makar began to laugh, and said: "As it was in your bag the  knife was found, you doubtless killed him yourself.  If it should  be that some one else put the knife there—why, not caught, not a  thief.  And, moreover, how could he have placed the knife in your  bag?  You had it under your head.  You must have heard."

       On hearing these words, Askenov perceived clearly that he was  the person who had killed the merchant.  He arose and went away.   All that night Askenov could not sleep.  He fell into profound  listlessness, and dreamed dreams.  Now it was his wife he saw as  she appeared at the time of that last fair.  He saw her still  alive, her face, her eyes; he heard her speak and laugh: now it was  his children who appeared to him as they then were, all small, one  in a fur cloak and the other at the breast.  He saw himself as he  then was, young, lively, seated and playing the guitar on the  doorstep of the tavern, where he was arrested.  And he was reminded  of the infamous place where they had whipped him, of the  executioner, of the crowd round about, the irons, convicts, and of  the twenty-six years he had spent in prison.  He thought of his old  age, and a desire to take his own life seized upon Askenov.

       "And all this on account of that brigand!" he thought.

       He felt such a passion of wrath against Makar coming over him,  that he would have been willing to perish that hour could he be  revenged upon him.  He prayed all night without being able to calm  himself.  The next morning he did not approach nor look at Makar.

       Fifteen days passed thus.  Askenov could not sleep at night,  and during the day he felt such a weariness that he knew not what  to do with himself.  One night, as he was walking up and down in  the prison, he perceived that earth was being thrown from under one  of the planks used as a bed.  He stopped to see what was going on,  and all at once Makar came quickly from beneath the   bed,  and looked at Askenov with an expression of terror.  The latter  wished to pass on so as to avoid looking at him; but Makar seized  him by the hand, and told him how he was digging a tunnel under the  wall, how he was in the habit of filling his boots with the earth  thrown up and emptying it in the street every morning when they  were taken out to work.  He added:

       "Only keep quiet, old man.  I will take you with me.  If you  expose me I will be whipped to the last extremity, but you will pay  for it.  I will kill you!"

       Looking at him who had ruined him, Askenov trembled with  anger.  He drew away his hand, and said: "I do not desire to  escape, and you will have no need to murder me.  You have already  killed me a long time ago.  Whether I shall expose you or not is  for God to decide."

       The next morning, when the convicts were taken to work, the  soldiers noticed that Makar emptied earth from his boots.  An  investigation was made in the prison, and the tunnel was  discovered.  The overseer came and demanded to know who had  excavated it.  Every body denied all knowledge of the matter.   Those who knew, did not wish to betray Makar, as he would be  whipped "half-dead" for his offense.  The chief then addressed  himself to Askenov.

       "Old man," he said, "you who are an upright fellow, tell me  who has done this."

       Makar remained impassible, looking at the superintendent  without turning toward Askenov.  As to the latter, his arms and his  legs trembled; he could not say a word.

       "Shall I remain silent?" he thought.  "But why pardon him,  since it is he who has ruined my life?  Let him pay for my  tortures.  Shall I speak?  True, they will whip him nearly to  death, and if it should not be he, if he should not be the assassin  I suspect him to be—and then, would it be any solace to me?"

       The chief repeated his demand.  Askenov looked at Makar, and  replied:

       "I cannot tell, your highness; God does not permit me, and I  shall not tell you.  Do with me as you please.  You are master."

       Notwithstanding every effort of the chief, Askenov said no  more.  Thus it was that no one knew who had dug the tunnel.

       The following night, as Askenov was reclining upon his plank-bed trying to sleep, he heard some one approach and place himself  at his feet.  Through the obscurity he recognized Makar.  Askenov  said to him:

       "Have you still further need of me?  What are you doing  there?"

       Makar remained silent, and Askenov raised himself up saying:  "What do you want?  Go away, or I will call the watchman."

       Makar hung over Askenov and whispered in his ear: "Ivan  Askenov, forgive me."

       "Why?  What should I forgive you?"

       "It was I who murdered the merchant, and I put the knife in  your bag!  I intended to kill you also, but some one made a noise  in the yard.  I placed the knife in your bag, and escaped by the  window."

       Askenov remained silent, and knew not what to say.

       Makar slipped from the bed, prostrated himself on the earth,  and said:

       "Ivan Askenov, pardon me; in the name of God, pardon me!  I  will declare that I killed the merchant; they will set you at  liberty, and you can return home."

       And Askenov replied: "That is easily said.  But I, I have  suffered here too long.  Where should I go now?  My wife is dead;  my children have forgotten me.  I have nowhere to go."

       Makar, still prostrated and striking the earth with his head,  said: "Ivan, pardon me.  If I had been beaten with the knout, that  would have been less painful that [sic] to see you thus.  And you  still had pity on me; you did not expose me.  Pardon me, in the  name of Christ, pardon a wretched malefactor!"  And he began to  sob.

       Hearing Makar weeping, Askenov himself also began to weep.

       "God will pardon you.  Perhaps I am a hundred times worse than  you."

       And he felt a sudden joy flooding his soul.  He ceased from  that moment to grieve over his home, and no longer desired to leave  his prison.  He thought only of his last hour.

       Makar would not listen to Askenov, and declared himself the  guilty one.  When the order came to restore Askenov to liberty, he  was already dead.
