               The title-poem of Mrs. Wharton's *Artemis to Actaeon*  takes a very different but equally modern view of the same goddess  [as Mr. Hewlett's].  Her Artemis slays Actaeon not in anger, but in  grace, recognising in him who dared to look upon her a soul too  great for the little uses of the world, worthy of that immortality  which is death.  Now, there are two ways of handling mythological  material: one may simply retell the old stories vividly, for the  sheer beauty that is in them; or one may seek out some latent  meaning, some new idea whereof the myth will form a fitting  incarnation.  The trouble with these present examples of the second  method is that they do violence to the spirit of the myth.  The  vigorous and original mentality which has done so much for Mrs.  Wharton as a novelist stands somewhat in her light as a poet.  It  is not that a poem can be too intellectual, but that it must not be  more intellectual than emotional; and Mrs. Wharton's thought  sometimes absorbs her feeling and leaves her language dry.    -   Orpheus the Harper, coming to the gate
  -   Where the implacable dim warder sate,
  -   Besought for parley with a shade within,
  -   Dearer to him than life itself had been,
  -   Sweeter than sunlight on Illyrian sea . . .
    Compare with this the opening of Mr. Stephen Phillips's "Christ in  Hades":    -   Keen as a blinded man at dawn awake
  -   Smells in the dark the cold odor of earth—
  -   Eastward he turns his eyes, and over him
  -   A dreadful freshness exquisitely breathes—
    This is the magic; the other is only well written; thought, not  felt.  But the most of Mrs. Wharton's book is far better.  It is a  delight to follow the steady and sonorous lines of her blank verse  and to note how thoroughly she has assimilated the craftsmanship of  her models.  Tennyson and Mr. Phillips have given her style,  Browning has taught her monologue and Rossetti sonnet-form; yet  there is not an imitative line in her book.  She has made her  learning her own; and there is far more personality in her poems  than in Mr. Hewlett's.  "Margaret of Cortona" is perhaps the best  of them.  In her girlhood a man took Margaret out of the slums,  made her a woman and wise.  He dying, she took the veil, and in  time became a saint; and the poem is her confession.    - Judge Thou alone between this priest and me;
  - Nay, rather, Lord, between my past and present,
  - Thy Margaret and that other's—whose she is
  - By right of salvage—and whose call should follow
  - Thine?  Silent still—  Or his who stooped to her,
  - And drew her to Thee by the bands of love?
  - Not Thine?  Then his?
  -           Ah, Christ—the thorn-crowned Head
  - Bends . . . bends again . . . down on your knees, Fra Paolo!
  - If his, then Thine!
  -           Kneel, priest, for this is heaven . . .
    Mrs. Wharton is at her best in the dramatic monologue, both because  of her power of characterisation and because blank verse is her  readiest medium.  Rhyme often troubles her; and some of her  sonnets, though well versified, are abstract and confused in  expression.  She was not born a poet; but this volume shows well  how high in poetry a thoroughly cultured prose artist may attain.   It is a noble and worthy piece of work, of which at least no living  poet need be ashamed.
