#     Shehens' Houn' Dogs
    BY ELIA W. PEATTIE
    Author of "The Shape of Fear," "The Door," etc.  

     EDWARD Berenson, the Washington correspondent for the New  York *News*, descended from the sleeping-car at Hardin,  Kentucky, and inquired for the stage to Ballington's Gap.  But there  was, it appeared, no stage.  Neither was a conveyance to be hired.   The community looked at Berenson and went by on the other side.   He had, indeed, as he recollected, with a too confiding candor,  registered himself from Washington, and there were reasons in  plenty why strangers should not be taken over to Ballington's Gap  promiscuously, so to speak, by the neighbors at Hardin.  Berenson  had come down from Washington with a purpose, however, and he  was not to be frustrated.  He wished to inquire    —    politely    —    why, for  four generations, the Shehens and the Babbs had been killing each  other.  He meant to put the question calmly and in the interest of  scientific journalism, but he was quite determined to have it  answered.  To this end he bought a lank mare for seventy-five  dollars    —    "an th' fixin's thrown in, sah"    —    and set out upon a red  road, bound for the Arcadian distance.  

The mountains did not look like the        retreat of revengeful clans.  They wore, on the contrary, a  benevolent aspect.  All that was visible was beautiful; and what lay  beyond appeared enchanted.  The hill-sides flowered with laurel and  azalea; the winds met on the heights like elate spirits, united after a  too long separation; the sky was so near and so kind that it seemed  after all as if the translation of the weary body into something  immortal and impregnable to pain were not so mad a dream.   Pleasant streams whispered through the pine woods, and the thrush  sang from solitary places.  

Berenson had ridden far, and the soft twilight was coming upon  him, when he met the first human being since leaving Hardin.  It  was a slight, sallow, graceful mountaineer with a long rifle flung in  the easy hollow of his arm.  He emerged suddenly upon Berenson    —     so suddenly as to disturb the none too sensitive nerves of the mare,  who shied incautiously over the edge of the roadway.  The two  saluted, and Berenson pulled in his nag.  

"How far am I from Ballington's Gap, sir?"  

"'Bout two mile, sah, if you don't go wrong at th' fawk.  Bin to  Hardin?"  

"Yes    —    I left the train there."  

"Did the folks there send yo' on heah?"  

"Well, they let me come," said Berenson with swift divination.  

"That theah ole Pap Waddell's hoss yo' all ridin'?"  

"Why, I believe it is    —    or was.  It's mine now."  

"How much    —    if it's fair askin'?"  

"Seventy-five dollars and the saddle thrown in."  

A slow smile illuminated the sallow face    —    the sort of a smile  that dawns when one perceives a joke.  The mountaineer drew a  long dark plug of tobacco from his pocket.  

"D'ye chaw?" he inquired with pensive sweetness.  

"I smoke," said Berenson, and offered his pocket case of  Havanas.  The two lighted up, and the man walked beside the mare  as they proceeded.  

"We-all bin havin' a good deal of disturbance raound heah,  lately," volunteered the mountaineer.  

"Yes, so I hear."  

"What with the Shehens defendin' theah h'athstones, an th'  Babbses raisin' hell, 'twas bad enough    —    trouble an' to spa-h.  An'  now th' revinooers    —   "  

"I didn't know they'd been giving you trouble lately."  

Berenson did not feel that he ran any risk in identifying his  companion with the "blockaders."  Loyal mountain sentiment, as he  knew, was with the keepers of the stills.  

"Yaas, they've bin amongst us ag'in.  As I was sayin', all this  makes us more inquirin' than polite, sah, an' it's my place to find out  the business of them that comes to the gap.  As we ah gittin' mighty  neah thah this minute, I've got to come to th' p'int."  He smiled at  Berenson ingratiatingly.  

"Well," said Berenson, slipping from his horse and taking his  place beside his inquisitor, "you shall have a full and complete  answer.  I'm a newspaper man, and I've come down here to inquire  into the meaning of this feud    —    this Shehen-Babb difficulty that has  been going on down here for the past twenty-five years    —    or is it  longer?"  

"I don't know jes' the numbah of yeahs, but it's in the fourth  generation, sah.  But I don't see why it should consahn outsidahs,  sah."  

Berenson looked at him with genuine interest.  He had a dignity  and a grace that were almost distinguished.  He bore himself with  nonchalance    —    something as might any clansman, certain of the  rights of his position, and firm in his ability to protect his own.  He  was young    —    not more than twenty-two.  His tan-colored jeans hung  easily upon his lithe and muscular body.  His eyes had a kindly  expression at moments, but in re-        pose were marked by a certain mournfulness.  

"Well," said Berenson, "the newspapers have fallen into the way  of thinking that everything is their business.  They are probably  wrong, but as long as I work for them    —    and I don't know enough to  make my living any other way    —    I shall act according to their  policy.  Now, up North, we have become greatly interested in your  feud.  We have quarrels of our own up there, but they are not  inherited quarrels.  We don't carry on a fight from the grave to the  cradle, and the cradle to the grave.  We don't keep on fighting after  we've forgotten what the row is about, and we want to know why  you do.  It strikes us that you have the habits of the old Highlanders,  and that these vendettas of yours resemble the old wars of the clans     —   "  

"Waal," interrupted the other, with a philosophical intonation.   "We all are Scotch or Irish, mostly."  

"That's so!" cried Berenson.  "Of course you are!  Anyway, I've  come down here to get an impartial account of the whole matter,  and I want to meet any man    —    as many men as I can    —    who will  give me the rights of it."  

The mountaineer motioned Berenson to stop.  He turned to the  side of the road, unslung a horn cup from his shoulder, and,  stooping, brought it up filled with glistening spring water.  He held  it out to Berenson with a charming gesture of hospitality.  Berenson  bowed and accepted it.  

"It's good watah," said the other.  "I'm fond of watah myself."   He spoke as if his taste were rather exotic.  

"Waal, I'm powahful glad, Mr.    —   "  

"Berenson    —    Edward Berenson."  

"   —    Berenson, that yo' bin so squah in tellin' me of yo' business.   We don't have many visitahs from ovah yon.  'Bout th' only ones  that come heah ah th' revinooers, an' I needn't say, sah, to a man like  yo', that they ah not pahticularly welcome.  'Bout fo' yeahs ago a  fellow from Mr. Wattehson's papah did come t' these pahts when  they was some shootin', an' he took sides with th' Babbs."  (A  pause.)  "He nevah went back."  They stopped on a level bit of road  to breathe themselves, and Berenson received and returned the  whimsical smile of his companion.  "But what I like about you,"  went on the mountaineer, "is that yo' said yo' was goin' to be  impahshal.  I'm an impahshal man myself, and I think we should all  be impahshal.  Th' trouble with outsiders is that they ah not  impahshal."  

"Well, it's a fine thing *to* be," assented Berenson.  "You  make judges out of stuff like that.  Any judges in your family?"  

"One, sah."  

"Still living?"  

"No, sah.  Passed away las' yeah."  

"What was his name?"  

"Loren Shehen, sah."  

Berenson's heart performed an acrobatic feat.  

"Are you a Shehen, sir?"  

"I have that honah, sah.  I'm th' last."  

"You don't, I'm sure, mean that you are the last survivor?"  

"No, sah, I do not.  I mean I'm the youngest bohn.  Theah's a  numbah of us yet on Tulula mountain, sah.  Theah's my fathah, an'  my two eldah brothahs, an my Uncle Dudley and one son of his, an'  my second cousin Edgah    —    an' theah ah othahs, kinfolk, but not  close related.  The Judge was with us last yeah, but he was killed,  by a hull pahcel of Babbs    —    a hull yelpin' pack of 'em."  

"You've lived here all your life, Mr. Shehen?"  

The mountaineer's eyes twinkled.  

"Waal, not yit, Mr. Berenson, but I expect to, sah."  

Berenson smiled.  

"I should think, however, that in spite of the impartial disposition  which you say is native to you, Mr. Shehen, that you would have  difficulty in dealing with the matter of the feud without some heat."          

"No heat at all, sah!  You don't git heated when yo' speak of  rattlesnakes, do yeh?  They ah jest snakes!  You kill 'em when yo'  kin.  Well, Babbs ah th' same.  They ah the meanest set of snakes  that crawl on theah bellies.  That's an impahshal opinion, sah.  Yo'  kin ask th' next man we meet."  

Berenson gave up all effort to keep a sober face.  He grinned,  then guffawed.  He made the rocks ring with his laughter.  The  mountaineer regarded him indulgently.  

"It's a true wohd," he said quietly.  

"I haven't had your full name yet," said Berenson, when he got  breath again.  

"Bill Shehen, sah    —    young Bill."  

"Well, I'm glad I met you, Mr. Shehen!  I want to hear your side  of the story from beginning to end.  Now where can I put up?  I  want to stay here for some time.  It's not alone on account of my  paper.  I need the rest.  I'm tired.  I want to talk with all the Shehens  I can, and all the Babbs I can."  

"Now that's whah yo' make yo' mistake, sah.  Yo' cain't talk with  both Shehens *an'* Babbs.  If yo' go on to th' Gap with me,  and bunk at my place to-night    —    an' yo' ah welcome, sah    —    yo've got  to 'bide with us.  Yo' will be counted a Shehen sympathizah.  I don't  suppose any one from th' outside kin ondehstand, sah.  I don't  expect 'em to do so.  I thought about it a plenty.  It's jest this: bein'  bohn a Shehen, yo' nuss hate fo' th' Babbs with yo' mothah's milk;  bein' bohn a Babb, yo' git silly mad evah time yo' see a Shehen.   Bein' of one kind, yo' cain't pass the othah kind on th' road; yo' cain't  heah of anything they do without a cold feelin' in yo' stomach.   When yo' git to fightin' 'em, yo' feel like shoutin' like the niggahs at  praise meetin'.  I thought it ovah, sah, an' I've about come to the  conclusion that it's a disease.  Folks call it a feud.  Well, I call it a  disease    —    the Shehen-Babb disease."  

Berenson put a hand on the man's shoulder.  

"Well, then, William Shehen, if you've found that out, why don't  you cure yourself?  If it's a disease, it's a fatal one!  It brings your  men to untimely death, and your women to sorrow.  Don't set your  sons    —    when you get them    —    in the way of inheriting the same  fearful malady.  Get out and get away from it all.  Do something  besides destroy and make bad whisky.  For you do make whisky, I  suppose."  

"Yaas," said the other gently, "but it ain't so damned bad."  His  voice had soughing intonations, like the wind in the pines.  

"I'll wager you've got a bottle of it in your pocket now," said  Berenson.  

"Waal!" the wind was never softer on a summer night.  

"Well, I've a bottle of the ordinary whisky of commerce.  I'll bet  mine is the smoother, the nuttier, and altogether the pleasanter."  

Three buzzards sitting on the dead branch of a Norway pine  received a shock from which they did not recover for several days.   They had seen walking along the road two quiet men, one sad mare,  and a long thin dog with a lame foot.  They suddenly beheld a swift  change    —    a *tableau vivant*.  One man stood at the point of  the other man's rifle.  The mare had jerked away and was backing,  with frightened eyes, toward the verge of the steep mountain side.   The dog had crouched down as if to get out of the way of trouble.  

"I believe yo' all ah a damned revinooer aftah all!" said Shehen.   He did not raise his voice, but he spoke between closed teeth.  His  blue gray eyes had become like points of steel.  Berenson, equally  tall, in his dark, city clothes, his inappropriate derby above his long,  office-bleached face, looked Shehen squarely in the eye.  

"I'm not," he said.  "I'm just what I told you I was.  I haven't a  firearm on me.  If you shoot, you kill an unarmed man.  Besides,  you will have made a mis-      take.  The only trouble is, that while I like your jokes, you don't like  mine.  Up North, when we don't like a man's jokes, we tell him he's  an ass; we don't kill him."  

The buzzards saw the tableau remain, for an appreciable  moment, undisturbed.  Then the mountaineer lowered his rifle and  flung it back upon his arm.  He looked shamefaced.  Something like  tears came into his embarrassed eyes.  Berenson regarded him  coldly.  The other, meeting the expression, flushed scarlet.  Then he  shook his fist before Berenson's eyes.  

"That's it," he cried.  "That's what I say!  The life heah makes    —     fools of us!  We ah afeahd of shadows!  We have nothin' to show fo'  ouah lives!  We live to kill    —    that's it    —    we live to kill.  What has my  family done fo' the community?  What *is* the community?   It's a beautiful country, but what do we do with it?  We live like  wolves, sah    —    like wolves.  Ain't that how we seem to yo' all?"  

He was suddenly no more than a boy.  His height seemed,  indeed, to have belied him.  He looked his passionate inquiry at  Berenson, who warmed again into liking.  

"Why don't you get out of it all?" demanded Berenson.  "Cut it!   Quit it!  Vamoose!  Come where they're doing something    —    where  they're talking about something worth while.  Why, you're an  intelligent fellow.  You've courage.  You've had some education,  too, haven't you?"  

"Dad sent me to Hahdin to the Industrial school; an' I've some  books.  I take pleasuah in readin', sah."  

"I knew it!  Well, get out of this place and make a man of  yourself."  

Shehen said nothing.  To the acute disappointment of the  buzzards, the horse was recaptured, the dog recovered, and the two  men went on side by side.  

The buzzards spread their wings, stretched their necks with a  disgusted gesture, and flew away.  Silence fell upon the travelers.   They were coming to a hamlet.  Back from the road, bowered in  roses, was a tumble-down house.  It was built of logs, and divided in  the center by an open chamber.  Three wolf-like dogs ran out to  greet Shehen.  The mountaineer stopped to welcome them, rubbing  his hands over their backs, scratching them behind the ears, and  finally lifting one of them up in his arms.  

  "They seem to be very quiet hounds," said Berenson.  "How did  you teach them to be so well behaved?"  

Berenson's companion regarded him with amusement.  

"Thah's reasons, sah, why the Shehens' houn-dogs *hes* to  be quiet.  We nevah did publish ouah place of residence!  But thah's  times when they cain't be kep' still, an' that's when one of the clan  has bad luck comin' to him.  They ah well trained, sah, but they do  have theah times of howlin'!"  

"And about that time," suggested          Berenson, "you want to get your rabbit-foot out."  

Bill Shehen nodded.  

"If you've got one handy," he agreed.  "Fathah an' th' boys have  been in a little trouble this week.  They ah all away.  Come in and  spend th' night, sah.  I want to talk to yo'."  

It was said with the conviction that a refusal was impossible.   And, indeed, Berenson considered it so.  They put up the horse, and  went into the great living room, which ran across one entire side of  the house    —    three bedrooms occupying the other side.  Shehen  pointed to a crayon picture on the wall    —    the only picture in the  room.  

"That's my mothah," he said with a sweet and frank reverence.   "She died last yeah."  The portrait was a poor one, but it could not  conceal the look of fatality in the dead woman's eyes.  It was the  same look that Berenson had noticed in the eyes of her son.  A wave  of compassion for both of them swept over him.  He was left alone  for a moment, and he stood before the crayon, seeing yet not seeing  it.  

They ate together, and then sat out beneath the hoary hemlocks,  and watched the moon rise, scarlet, over the mountain's brow.   Berenson felt at ease    —    at ease with the night, and the place, and the  man.  The whip-poor-will iterated his foolish call from below them,  and almost above their heads the hoot owl cried.  

"I can't say but that I'd be willing to get along without those two  birds," said Berenson.  

"They ah very insistin'," agreed Shehen.  "Of co'se I know how to  make that hoot owl shet up, but the whip-pooah-will is one too  many for me."  

"And how can you make the hoot owl hush?  By killing it?"  

Shehen grinned.  

"Thah's ways of doin' things up here that you all woulden' take  stock in," he ventured.  

"Well, I don't know about that.  What do you suggest?"  

"Yo'all take off youah slippah, sah, an' change the right slippah  to the lef' foot an' see what happens."  

The industrious owl was in full cry as Berenson bent to obey this  extraordinary request.  But her mournful gurgle died in her throat.  

"She'll shet up now," murmured Shehen, lazily lighting his pipe.   And so she did.  Not another sound issued from her depressing  throat.  Berenson made the echoes ring with laughter.  

"You don't believe such stuff, man?"  

"No-o," pensively murmured the mountaineer.  "We don't none  of us believe in it!  It jes' happens that a-way, that's all.  An' I may  say, jes' fo' yo' info'mation, thet if yo' haven't on slippahs and it's  inconvenient to change youah boots, heatin' a pokah red hot will do  jes' as well."  

"Thanks," said Berenson, and told of some family superstitions  of his own.  

But they talked of wiser things, too.  Shehen liked books, as he  said, and he showed Berenson a catalogue of the year's publications,  with the volumes he had purchased or proposed to buy, marked off.   He turned to serious matters; was fascinated with popular science,  and expressed a wish to have a "star-glass" of his own.  He knew the  names of the constellations, it appeared, and he called his  companion's attention to the color of the different stars.  

"I may be wrong," the Washington man said to the mountaineer  that night, "but I think you are wasting yourself here.  You ought to  have more appreciation of yourself.  The only way you can take  your own measure is by standing up alongside other men.  You're  made for happiness and society and some nice girl's love, and good  books and a home of your own.  I can't think why you've not seen  all this for yourself."  

The mountaineer reached a hand down to stroke one of the dogs.          

"I reckon I've seen it," he said.  "But my ole dad is one to have  his way.  They call him the Ten-Tined Buck of Tulula mountain.  It  never was much good runnin' counter to him."  

"Will you come up to Washington with me if I get his consent?   I'll stay here and get acquainted with him, and I'll locate you up  there in some way.  I tell you, when the chance really offers he'll  want you to avail yourself of it.  You'll see!"  

The sound of the "branch" dripping over the rocks came to their  ears.  The hermit thrush cast the soft pearls of his melody upon the  air.  With infinite rustlings, the night settled about them, beneficent  as a prayer.  

"I mout try it up there," mused the mountaineer.  "But I was  always a home-keepin' fellow."  

Berenson went to bed perplexed.  The boy was as innocent and  wistful as a girl, outlaw though he confessed himself.  Having    —     inadvertently    —    finished too quickly and too disastrously his own  individual interest in life, Berenson had fallen into a way of  deriving vicarious zest by interfering in the lives of others.  And, the  case of young Bill Shehen seemed to offer a rare opportunity for his  benevolent vice.    

Three weeks later Berenson went back to Washington.  The  period of his investigation had not been without adventure    —    even  danger.  He had made enemies and friends; he had felt partizanship.   He had absorbed something of the point of view of these courteous,  murderous, soft-voiced, battle-loving, mountain-whelped, clannish,  affectionate, sentimental, law-defying men.  He liked them    —    liked  their inconsistencies, their excesses, their barbarism, their  hospitality, their piety, and their heathenism.  And he carried to  Washington with him, as friend and companion, one William  Shehen, junior, son of Tulula's "Ten-Tined Buck."  

If Shehen was shy, he was also sociable.  He had a way with  mountains    —    understood them and answered them    —    but he had a  way with men, too.  He was always graceful, and he looked well in  the soft gray suit which he got at Berenson's advice, and in the  drooping gray felt hat.  He carried himself with nonchalance, took  long, swinging strides, looked men almost too insistently in the eye,  and was rather elaborate in his courtesy.  He had, as a part of his  indestructible possession, a knowledge of how educated men talked.   He had read, and he had remembered.  Away from his native  environment, he employed something of this knowledge, which  came within his literary, but not his actual, experience.  The soft  tricks of his earth-born, forest-nurtured speech clung to him, but in  Washington these were not marked as amazing.  His  *naïveté* and his gentleness won him friends.  

Berenson soon found an office position for him, and he filled it  with faithfulness, though his patron never dropped in to see him that  he was not distressed at the curious wistfulness in the boy's eyes.   He who had known only his own will now submitted, from eight in  the morning till half after five in the evening, to the will of others.   His days were given up to minutiæ, every last particle of  which was laid out for him.  He had hitherto acted solely on his own  initiative, or had followed the rough autocracy of old Bill, his  father, the leader of his herd    —    the ten-tined buck of Tulula  Mountain.  He was captive now    —    this wild creature, whose caprices  had been his guide.  Berenson pitied him, yet expected ultimate  happiness for him.  Civilization might be rather a stupid escape  from barbarism, but after all, when a barbarian got to yearning for  civilization, as Shehen had, it seemed best to give it to him.  

Shehen went to the Presbyterian church, and he sang so well that  the choirmaster requested him to join his          baritones, which the young mountaineer did, with unfeigned  pleasure.  He sang with the open and flexible throat, knew his notes,  and was as teachable as an intelligent child.  He boarded with a  widow who had two daughters, one other boarder and a flower  garden.  Bill used to work in the garden with the young daughter  mornings before he went to the office.  Her name was Summer  MacDonald.  She had had, far back, much the same ancestry as he.   Something atavistic stirred in the two of them and gave them  sympathies which could not be expressed.  Besides, they were both  young, they were training roses and weeding mignonette together,  and at night they sometimes took a walk in the moonlight.  They  sang together, too, Summer selecting the songs, which were  *adagio* and *andantino*, a trifle sad, and relating to  love or religion.  She had been going to the Congregational church,  but she changed now, and went off every Sunday morning with  Shehen, and after a while she got admitted to the choir, too, though  her voice was not strong.  

Bill liked it, however, the way it was.  It flowed along like a  pretty "branch" over the mica-starred soil of his mountains.  Her  face was pale and delicate, and she wore white frocks, and a wide  white hat with drooping blue plumes on it.  Even in the morning,  about her work, she dressed in white, with fetching pink or blue  gingham aprons, cut like a child's pinafore, covering them for  neatness.  With her light braids down her back, she looked like a  child.  She and Shehen were as happy as they could be.  They used,  sometimes, when they were walking together in the garden, to catch  hold of hands and swing back and forth, out of sheer lightness of  heart, and just as little children do.  Bill never kissed her, but  sometimes, when he was sleeping and the summer wind, perfumed  from her garden, blew in upon him, he dreamt that she had kissed  him.  The caress was as light as thistle down; it had the breath of  violets, and it made him blush with happiness.  

Berenson used to take Shehen around the Capitol, and to the  Congressional Library and the Supreme Court Hall.  He talked to  him, casually, of government, of ideals of law, of the responsibility  of a nation.  He wished to make him comprehend what a nation  meant, and to make clear that individualism need not include  anarchy.  He gave him a very good notion of how anarchy worked  in cities, and he was not surprised to find Bill condemning it utterly.   He loathed city crime, too, which seemed to offend him as being  squalid and treacherous.  Poverty touched him deeply.  He could  save nothing.  He was always helping some one worse situated than  himself.  Berenson used to wonder if he was coming to have any  notion of why the moon-shiners were offenders against the good  order of the government; but though Bill's impulses were all on the  side of generosity and compassion, he still seemed to lack some  comprehension of the real meaning of law.  Berenson could never  cure him of the habit of going armed.  He would, at any time, have  been willing to dispense with his uncomfortable collar, or his tie,  but his toilet was never complete without his modest Smith and  Wesson.  The fact that he was, in wearing it, breaking a legal  regulation concerned him not at all.  It was a point of honor for a  Shehen to go armed.  That finished it.  

"You'll be getting a promotion some of these days, my boy,"  Berenson said to him.  "And then I suppose you and Miss Summer  will be setting up for yourselves and making your own flower  garden."  

Bill settled a spray of heliotrope in his buttonhole.  Miss  Summer had given it to him from her garden.  

"I don't know," he said slowly.  "If she knew about Ballington's  Gap and the still on Tulula Mountain, and all the          Babbs we all had killed, perhaps she wouldn't."  

"Tell her the story and see what she says," urged Berenson.  

"Yaas," smiled Bill, "eat the mushroom and see if you die!"  

As time went on it seemed, however, as if the mountaineer  would be likely to eat the mushroom.  Berenson used to meet Bill  and Miss Summer together, dreamful, on summer nights, and he noticed what seraphic intonation could be  given the simple word "we."  

     "Have you told her yet?" he ventured to ask one day.  

"I out with the whole yahn," Bill confessed.  

"And what was the effect of it?"  

"Waal, it was as if she didn't quite follow me.  I reckon she  thought I was layin' it on.  She said young men liked to play the  Othello game    —    that they wanted to be loved for the dangers they  had passed."  

"Miss Summer is a student of Shakespeare, then?"  

"We've been readin' it togethah," murmured Bill happily.  

Berenson could not help priding himself on his man.  He felt that  fine sense of partnership with the Creator which parents have when  they regard a beautiful and virtuous child.  Shehen the civilized, the  pacific, the bookish, the lover, the citizen, the law-abider, was in  part his product.  Berenson talked of him at the newspaper office  and at the club.  People asked to meet him, and Berenson liked  nothing better than a Sunday afternoon in Bill's company.   Berenson's friends regarded his *protégé* with  mingled amusement and affection, and the mountaineer found  himself with a circle of surprisingly distinguished acquaintances.  

Shehen finally brought word that he had rented a little cottage    —     a four-roomed affair with a garden plot.  He had a charming view,  and, with plenty of seeds and saplings from the Agricultural  Department, he didn't see why he couldn't be perfectly happy.  All  he and Miss Summer wished, apparently, was to be together, to  have a roof in case of storm or nightfall    —    and both seemed more or  less unlikely in their atmosphere of high noon and sun    —    and to  have a patch of earth to grow perfumed things in.  Berenson was  delighted.  He had not enjoyed life so much for a long time.  Having  been under the necessity of setting aside the more idyllic  department of life, he now regaled himself with his creature's  happiness.  He had begun to visit the furniture stores with the view  to a comprehensive wedding present, and he had set the day when  he was to go with the prospective bride to make the selections.  

Berenson had his own ideas about how a bride's little drawing-room ought to be furnished.  He had, indeed, treasured these ideas  for many years.  Now, for the first time, he had an opportunity for  putting them into execution.        

The evening before the day appointed for this agreeable task,  Berenson and Bill had dinner together.  

"I may be wrong," said the newspaper man, "and I hope I am, my  boy, but it strikes me that you're not looking quite so enthusiastic as  you should be.  Haven't you been sleeping well?  You look like a  man who's been losing sleep."  

"I sleep well enough, but    —   "  

"Yes.  Well    —   "  

"But three nights runnin' I've had the oddes' dream!"  

"Not a disagreeable dream, I hope!  You've enough pleasant  things to dream about, I should think."  

"Well, yo' might call it a bad dream, an' yo' might not, Mr.  Berenson.  It's    —    it's the houn's, yo' know.  I heah 'em bahkin' all up  the side of Tulula    —    howlin' an' howlin' like somethin's goin' wrong.   It gives me a dreadful honin' fo' home."  

"Did you write to your father and brothers that you were to be  married?"  

"Oh, yes, sah, I wrote to all my kin.  I asked 'em to come daown,  but I know they won't do that, sah.  An' what's moah, the knowledge  that I was about to be married would keep 'em from tellin' me if  anything *was* goin' wrong."  

"Well, I wouldn't worry.  Dreams are out of date, you know.   You are dreaming because you are nervous, and you're nervous  because you are going to be married.  That's all there is to that.  It's  usual under the circumstances."  

"I reckon," murmured the mountaineer, "but I suah did heah  those houn' dogs!"  

He said no more about it, and left Berenson, to make his way to  his sweet-heart's house.  Berenson, strolling along before going to  his rooms, saw the two of them pacing back and forth in the little  garden.  He heard the low sound of their laughter.  They were quite  safe in Arcady, he concluded, and went to his bed well pleased with  the idyl of his making.  

The next morning he awoke with the consciousness of a  singularly paternal feeling.  He was to meet Miss MacDonald at ten,  and nine o'clock found him at his club reading his paper and waiting  for his breakfast.  

He had unfolded his sheet and was settling back for the  enjoyment of it when the door boy entered.  He was making for  Berenson, and that gentleman of well-arranged habits felt a touch of  annoyance.  

"A gentleman and lady to see you, sir."  

He presented a card.  On it were written in the girl's chirography  the names of his lovers    —    just "Bill and Summer" in perfect  confidence and unconventionality.  

Something was wrong, evidently.  Every step that Berenson took  toward the little parlor into which they had been shown convinced  him that something was very wrong.  

It was, indeed, two white and drawn faces that he encountered,  and the second glance showed him the girl's face eloquent with  appeal and the man's set in stern and obstinate lines.  

"For Heaven's sake, what's the trouble?" he broke out, closing the  door behind him.  

Bill pointed a quivering finger at the paper Berenson had  unconsciously retained.  

"Have yo' read that, sah?"  

"No, I haven't.  I was just about to when"    —    he had shaken the  paper out and swept his practised glance over the headings.  There,  in their ancient and fatal juxtaposition, were the names of Shehen  and Babb!  Berenson's eye ate up the despatch.  The vendetta was  on again.  Tulula Mountain was a battle-field.  Old Bill was slain.   So was Loren, his eldest son.  So was Dudley, the brother of the  elder William.  Dudley's two sons and William's second son, Lee,  were entrenched in the old Shehen shack.  The Babbs held them  there, be-        leaguered    —    kept them at bay on one side and held off the officers  of the law on the other.  The Babbs, it appeared, had accessions to  their side.  The trouble had broken out when some of the contending  factions met, during a four days' rain-storm, where much corn  whisky was dispensed.  

"I'm going back, sah," announced Bill when Berenson lifted his  eyes from the page.  

"I brought him here to you, sir," cried the girl.  "I could do  nothing with him!    

 	He came an hour ago and  told me, and I've pleaded and pleaded."  

"You'll go to your death!" broke in Berenson, seizing the  mountaineer by the arm.  "Or you'll make a murderer of yourself    —     which will be worse!  Don't be a fool!  Don't be a lunatic!  Your  duty's here!  Look at that dear little girl.  Think what she    —   "  

"They-all hev killed my ole dad," muttered Shehen.  The  vernacular had tangled his tongue again.  

"But I say you've no right to leave," protested Berenson, shaking  him by the shoulder.  "You belong here with that girl.  Your honor  is involved here, not in that death's hole back in the mountains."  

Bill's face did not soften in the least.  His eyes were as cruel as  bayonets; his face settled in battle lines.  He looked taller and his  boyhood was gone from him.  

"They-all have got Loren, too!"  It was as if Berenson's words  had not penetrated to his understanding.  

"You hear him!" sobbed the girl.  "Oh Bill!  Bill, dear!  I can't  give you up.  Oh, all our happiness together, Bill    —    that we planned!   And the home, Bill, and all we were going to do for mother and    —   "  

"Great God, man," cried Berenson.  "I can't stand the torture of  this, if you can!  You don't mean to stand there and break that girl's  heart, do you?"  

"I stand by my kin," said Bill.  But he seemed hardly to know  what he was saying.  He had decided to take the ten o'clock train.   He was in a daze; but the one idea persisted.  He was going to give  the Babbs something to do.  If they wanted a target, they should  have one.  In spirit he was climbing Tulula by          those secret paths which he and his clan knew.  He saw nothing save  the motherly old mountain, with hidden and treacherous foemen in  her fastnesses; he heard nothing but the howl of the Shehen "houn'  dogs" lamenting the slain.  

He would take nothing with him    —    none of the possessions he  had accumulated with frank pride.  

"I shan't be needin' much!" he said, a whimsical smile breaking  his face for the first time.  "I'll fit myself out at Hahdin."  He was  thinking of his armament.  

Summer had given up.  After he had unclasped her arms from his  neck, she made no further protest.  Her pride was wounded to the  death.  Her world was taken from her    —    her East, her West, her  moon, her sun    —    as the Gaelic rune has it.  

She sank upon a divan, and the tears had dried in her eyes.   Berenson went to her.  

"There's nothing to be done," he whispered.  "I'll call a cab for  you.  Go home to your mother    —    to her arms.  That's the best place,  after all."  

She stood up bravely, and he helped her from the room.  At the  door she turned and gave one backward look.  Bill was standing as  if turned to stone, but at that glance he threw his long, quivering  hands over his face.  

"Take her away," he groaned.  "Take her away."  

So Berenson put her behind the curtained windows of a cab and  stood while the vehicle drove down the sunlit street and out of sight.  

Then he went back to the mountaineer.  He got him to break  bread with him.  Bill would take little more    —    but he drained cup  after cup of the black coffee.  Then they went together to the  station.  They barely spoke.  There was nothing to say.  Berenson  had not, for years, felt pain so dragging at the throat, the heart, the  head, the feet of him.  He was clogged and burdened with it, and at  the last had only an impatient desire to have the parting over and be  through with the sharper misery.  

Bill strode before him, unconsciously taking the long, springing  lope of other days.  His blue eyes were repulsive, Berenson thought.   All the sweetness had gone out of his face.  Though for a glimpse it  returned, when Berenson, in a swift, uncontrollable emotion,  embraced him    —    this consecrated, mediæval boy, with doom  written large upon him.  So they parted.  Bill stood on the rear  platform of the train, tall, grim, uplifted by his hate even more than  he had ever been by love.  But after all, as Berenson reflected, love  lay fiercely at the core even of his hate.  The long train swung  around the curve with a mournful wail, and Berenson shuddered.  It  sounded, for all the world, like "Shehens' houn' dogs" with their  prophetic howl.
