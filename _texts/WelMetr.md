#  The METRIC SYSTEM: The Increasing Prospect of its Adoption in the United  States.  Judson C. Welliver.  
MUNSEY'S MAGAZINE, Volume LVII April, 1916, Number 3, pp. 490-493  

      POUNDS and ounces, gallons and quarts, tons and hundredweight,  miles and yards, feet and inches, acres and square feet, are  making ready for their exit from the stage of American business  affairs.

  Truth to say, they have had no good excuse for lingering with   us so long.  They ought to have been lifted out on the toe of the  legislative boot long ago.  They are confusing, obsolete,  unscientific, and calculated to demoralize all commercial  transactions measured in their terms.  Their continued existence  as the standards of weight and measurement in American business is  a testimony to our national conservatism, and to the overpowering  inertia that so often prevents the accomplishment of things which  everybody knows ought to be done.

  It is more than a century and a quarter since Thomas Jefferson  came home from France, where he had been helping the French  radicals to conduct their Revolution, and incidentally serving as  American minister, to tell the Washington administration that  pounds and ounces, feet and inches, gallons and quarts, were no  longer to be good form in the commercial world.  Those wonderful  French had devised a new and strictly scientific system of weights  and measures, based throughout on the decimal scale, so simple  that it well-nigh removed the necessity of learning mathematics.

  Jefferson assured his colleagues that the new system was  certain to become universal, and that even if the United States  didn't join forces with the French in spreading to all the world  the glories of freedom, equality, and fraternity, it ought at  least to adopt the metric system and emancipate the race from  arithmetic.

  The reign of terror in the intellectual life of the average  American is probably represented by that period in his scholastic  career when he is struggling with the intricacies of applied  arithmetic.  Did it ever occur to you that going to school might  have been one sweet dream of happiness if the so-called practical  problems in Ray's "New Higher Arithmetic" had never been invented?

  Most of these problems would scarcely exist, or would be  ridiculously easy of solution, if Jefferson could have had his way  and secured the adoption of the metric system.  The boasted  intellectual development that we are presumed to get from our  struggles with the impossible problems over in the "Third Part"  might have been denied to the race.

  Perhaps we should have paid a penalty in loss of mental vigor  and intellectual fiber, but there would have been compensations.   Everybody vaguely knows that the rich man's children are doomed to  be demoralized by the ease and luxury of their upholstered station  in life; but none the less almost everybody entertains a cheerful  feeling that it must be nice to be spoiled that way.

 So, too, with the intellectual discipline consequent upon our  adolescent wrestles with the tribulations of applied arithmetic.   Perhaps they are good for us, but how much happier we might be  without them!

  A very wise man once said that the invention of the Arabic  system of decimal numeration was the greatest single intellectual  achievement of the human mind.  If the statement seems somewhat  exaggerated,     try for a moment to imagine the chaos which  would ensue in this world if to-morrow morning all knowledge of  the decimal system, with its nine digits and a cipher, were  blotted out.  If it never occurred to you to realize what a time-saving and labor-saving contrivance it is, you have a real treat  in store.

  Just get down and dust off the volume of your encyclopedia  which contains the article on the decimal system, and read it.   Probably it never occurred to you that the established method of  numeration was anything less obvious and eternal than a force of  nature, like the attraction of gravitation.  Yet it is nothing of  the kind.  It was the product of a slow and difficult evolution  which required many centuries.

  Then, after it had struggled along for an eon or two without a  decimal point, some particularly gifted Arab conceived the idea of  that potent fly-speck, and adopted it into the system.  At another  stage of its development some other wily Oriental bethought him of  pointing off the figures in groups of three.  The greatest  contribution of all was that of the aboriginal philosopher who got  the notion into his noddle that a cipher, inserted at the right  place as the concrete representative of nothingness, would be the  finishing touch to the system.

  But get down your encyclopedia and read about it.  The story  is a fascinating one.  After you have read it, and precipitated  some little realization of what it meant to bring the decimal  system into a world that previously had conducted all its  mathematical operations with groups of pebbles or strings of  beads, you will begin to understand what Tom Jefferson had in mind  when he assured Washington and Hamilton that this French  contrivance of a new and sane system of weights and measures was  one of the distinguished contributions of the intellectual ferment  in France.

  Adopting the metric system for computation of distances,  weights, and quantities would simplify affairs for us just about  as much as the invention of the Arabic system of numeration  facilitated the business of making computations for the Assyrians  and Babylonians.

  The first point about the metric system is that it is the  system generally prevalent throughout the world.  We have adopted  it only in our coinage, which runs in multiplying units of ten;  but most countries have applied the same simple system to their  measures of dimensions, of contents, and of weight.

  If calculations of money had to be made under a method as  clumsy as is our fashion of dealing with weights, we should have  to pass a universal conscription act to get enough bank clerks,  cashiers, and bookkeepers to record the business of the country.

 From the beginnings of barter among savages, the problem of  establishing and standardizing units of measurement has  constituted one of the greatest difficulties incident to doing  business.  Yet it was not until a century and a quarter ago that  any government laid serious hold upon the problem and set about  the effort to force a universal system.

 The inspired enthusiasts of revolutionary France hesitated at  nothing, once convinced that they had discovered a realm in which  they could serve mankind.  So a commission of mathematicians,  which included Laplace, Lagrange, and Condorcet, among others, was  created by the Convention to devise a scientific scheme that  should be so much better than anything the world had ever known  that its adoption by all countries would be the only logical and  sensible conclusion.

 Just exactly this was actually accomplished.  The metric  system, first adopted by France, is now the legal system of all  continental Europe except Russia and Turkey, of all the Latin-American countries, and, in fact, of substantially the entire  Occidental world aside from the United States, Great Britain, and  most of the British Empire.

 It is legalized but not compulsory in Russia, Turkey, Japan,  Egypt, the United States, and Great Britain.  The Japanese system  is substantially similar to the metric, while nearly all technical  and scientific authorities use it in preference to any other.

 For example, the Bureau of Standards of the United States  government at Washington conducts all calculations and  computations in metric units, for reasons of convenience and  accuracy.  After the results have been obtained, it translates  them into the terms of our accepted system -- inches and feet,  ounces and pounds, and so forth.

 It is commonly supposed that the American and British units of  weight and measure     are identical.  As a matter of fact,  several of them differ.  They are so nearly alike, however, that  more errors are caused by their similarity than would occur if  they were utterly unrelated.  This is one of the strong arguments  for introducing the metric system as the sole legal standard in  both countries.

 Our own liquid quart and dry quart are not identical.  In  Great Britain and Canada, the liquid quart is twenty per cent  larger than our own, while the British standard bushel is three  per cent smaller than ours.

 When the Frenchmen started out to create their ideal system of  weights and measures, they determined to take as its basis some  value adopted from nature, perpetual and unchanging.  One proposal  was to use the length of a pendulum ticking seconds.  This was  conceived to be about as nearly a fixed quantity as anything  susceptible of accurate measurement.  It meant basing the system  on the revolutions of the planets, the length of the celestial  year, and the constancy of the force of gravitation.

 The commission finally decided that the basis of its system  should be the earth's polar quadrant -- that is, the precise  distance on the earth's surface from the equator to the pole.  At  that time it  was commonly assumed that this distance was absolute  and unchanging, but geology and geophysics have since taught men  that the world is not by any means constant in its circumference.

 However, the French scientists decided on this value as the  base of their system, and spent several years making computations  to determine the precise distance from the equator to the pole.   Then they divided this distance by ten million, and the resultant  unit of space was made the basis of the new system.

 This is the meter, approximately equivalent to 39.37 inches.   Ten meters make one decameter; ten decameters make one hectometer; ten hectometers make one kilometer, and ten kilometers make one  myriameter.  In the descending scale, the meter is divided into  ten decimeters, the decimeter into ten centimeters, and the  centimeter into ten millimeters.  The first set of terms is  derived from the Greek numbers, the second from the Latin.

 The ratio between the successive denominations in linear  measurements, in capacity, in money, and in weight, is ten; the  ratio between the successive denominations in surface measure is  one hundred, and in cubic measure one thousand.

 In determining the unit of weight, it was particularly desired  to have some absolutely fixed and unchangeable standard.  The  standard adopted is the weight of a cubic centimeter of pure  water, at the freezing-point and at sea-level.  As nearly as  possible, every element in this statement of conditions is  invariable.

 This weight unit, called the gram, is equal to 15.43 troy  grains under the English system.

 The basic unit for length being the meter, that for surface is  the square meter.  Areas of land are calculated in square  decameters, the decameter being approximately twenty-five one-thousandths of an acre.  The hectare the next denomination, equals  2.471 acres.

 The unit of capacity, the liter, is a cubic decimeter, which  is a little larger than the American liquid quart.

 It has been almost universally admitted, for many decades,  that the French system is the most nearly perfect that has ever  been devised.  Nobody has ever heard a substantial reason why our  own illogical and club-footed system should not be discarded in  favor of it.  In both the United States and England the use of the  metric system is permissive, but not compulsory.  In neither  country have people in general become familiar with it, and they  never will familiarize themselves with it unless it is made the  sole and compulsory standard.

 Our English cousins are a bit ahead of us with regard to the  metric system, because their world-wide trade relations have  compelled them to recognize the French standards.  Their  manufacturers and merchants now very generally base computations  on metric units in manufacturing or shipping goods for foreign  trade.  Since the European war has opened to American  manufacturers and workmen many new fields of opportunity, the fact  has been impressed as never before that our business must adapt  itself to the conditions imposed by customers, or they will take  their patronage elsewhere.

 At the opening of the present session of Congress,  Representative Charles H. Dillon, of South Dakota, introduced a  bill making the metric system permissive in this country until  July, 1920, after which time it is to be compulsory and exclusive.   At first there     was no special interest to indicate that any  better fate was in reserve for this bill than for many others of  its kind that have been introduced during the past century; but  the situation was suddenly changed one day when Secretary of  Commerce Redfield took a hand in the matter.

 Mr. Redfield, himself a manufacturer of large experience in  foreign trade, is a determined believer in the metric system.  He  called up Dr. S. W. Stratton, director of the Bureau of Standards,  and asked him to appear before the House committee considering the  Dillon bill.  Dr. Stratton complied, and before he had got half-way through his testimony the committee was all attention, eager  to know more about the system, and anxious to devise means for its  early adoption.

 The committeemen seemed to be about equally impressed with the  two sets of arguments in favor of the system; one set being  concerned with the reasons for adopting in our foreign trade what  is rapidly becoming the world's universal standard, and the other  based on the fact that the more scientific system would greatly  facilitate domestic business.  It was made very clear that  commerce with Spanish-speaking countries, and, indeed, with  practically all parts of the world in which it is hoped to extend  American trade would be sensibly promoted if the metric basis were  accepted.

 There are, however, some difficulties, entirely aside from  conservatism and inertia, about making the change.  The most  serious of these involves the measurement of land.  Land titles in  our country are based on acres, while the metric system would  substitute the hectare.  To reorganize the whole system of real-estate records, measurements, and surveys, and reduce acres to  hectares with absolute accuracy, would be a terrific task.    Conservatism rises to its most insistent climax at the suggestion  of any change that might possibly becloud titles to real property.

 It has been suggested that the metric scheme might be adopted  for all other than land measures; but this would be like taking  half a bite of a cherry.  Moreover, it is pointed out that this  country has once changed its unit of land measurement throughout a  large area with very little difficulty or complication.

 When Texas, California, Arizona, and New Mexico were acquired  from Mexico, they had already been surveyed under the Spanish  system, in which the unit of area is the *vara*.  Values in  *varas* had to be translated into terms of acres, and for a time  it was feared considerable difficulty would ensue.  However, the  thing was done much more easily than had been expected.  The  precise comparative values of the Spanish and American units were  determined, as they have repeatedly been fixed in the relations of  our American units to those of the metric system.  In a  comparatively short time, and with no great confusion, the  American units were substituted for the Spanish; and people  familiar with the procedure in that case give assurance that the  change from our present system to metric measurements would be  effected with small embarrassment.

 It is now becoming apparent for the first time that the change  cannot long be postponed, and that it is going to be highly  beneficial to business and science, to technical and popular  interests.

 It is probable that Great Britain will not be far behind us in  adopting the French units.  British manufacturers have had to use  French measurements in many new operations since the war has drawn  the two countries closer together than ever before, and even  English conservatism will not stand out forever against a good  system that is also a universal system.

    
## APRIL IN KENTUCKY  *(In Memoriam of Madison Cawein)*

  - THY slopes are golden with the glow
 - The dandelion scatters;
 - Thy hills and vales are decked with green,
 - To hide the winter's tatters.
      - Afar I hear the flutes of birds
 - That seem all sad from singing:
 - "He comes no more among us here
 - To set thy woodlands ringing!"
    W. F. McCaleb
