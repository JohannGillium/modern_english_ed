# AT THE DROPPING-OFF PLACE
  BY WILLIAM McLEOD RAINE

        IN THE cabin situated on Lot 10, Block E, Water Street, Eagle City,  Alaska, four men were striving to wear away the torment-laden, sleepless  Yukon night. It was twelve o'clock by the Waterbury watch which hung on  the wall, but save for a slight murkiness there was no sign of darkness.  The mosquitoes hummed with a fiendish pertinacity that effectually  precluded sleep. The thermometer registered one hundred degrees of  torture. A thick smoke from four pipes and a smudge-fire hung cloudlike  over the room, but entirely failed to disturb the countless pests.       

The torture of the hour fell heavily on the four outcasts, and  they writhed with silent curses and futile nausea of the soul.  One of  them lay on the floor, rolled in his blankets, damning the mosquitoes,  the country, his luck,—anything that he could lay a name to. The poor  living, the heat, lack of sleep, and the endless sunshine had worn his  nerves to the danger-point. He was in that condition in which the merest  word of his best friend would drive him into a rage. By birth he was an  Englishman, though the uncivilized ends of the earth had long claimed  him for their own.  He had been a soldier of the Queen in India and a  beachcomber in the South Sea islands. He had mined at Ballarat and at  Cripple Creek. The music-halls of London and the Chinese Quarter in San  Francisco were alike familiar to him. To-night the memories of the past  were torturing him, and he felt impelled to cry out like a whipped boy.       

Another man was sitting on his bunk patching his nether garments,  whistling softly to himself the while. He wore a jumper made from a  flour-sack with the lettering "EXCELSIOR XXX" stretched across his  breast, like a baseball player.  The rest of his costume was, for the  present, meager; it consisted of a frown.       

Just outside the hut, leaning over a camp-stove, was a third man,  Grover by name. Between two frying-pans, thrust into the coals, he was  cooking sour-dough bread.       

The fourth man was writing to his wife back in the States.       

Judged by ordinary standards, they were a disreputable  lot—dirty, unshaven, unkempt. Among them was only one respectable  article of wearing apparel—a mackinaw coat, owned by the man writing  home, who in consequence had been dubbed by the Englishman, "the swagger  swell." In point of fact the coat served as a dress-suit for any of the  men in their occasional trips to Dawson. If the rest of their clothing  was hopelessly nondescript and ragged, at least they had the consolation  of knowing they were no worse than their neighbors. Yet one of them  —the one patching his mackinaw trousers —was in all probability a  millionaire. A year before he had been a railroad navvy.  And the cook  was a graduate of one of the greatest of American colleges. He was a  clever cook, too, which was much more to the point. When one is reduced  to bacon, beans, and flour, the *cuisine* possibilities are  limited; but Grover was a man of imagination, and could produce a  greater variety than any man in Eagle City. His cooking would have  reduced a woman to despair.       

The writer finished his letter and read it over. It was a bright,  cheery letter, filled with love and hopes for better times after he  should make his strike. He touched with characteristic American humor on  the life he was leading, and described his companions with genuine  dramatic ability. The letter gave no hint of soul-weariness.       

"Finished your letter, Wood?"       

"Yes. Been writing her we have a blamed good time. Been writing  lies to keep her from worrying."       

The man on the floor rolled over with a groan.       

"What's the matter, Jones?"       

"Matter?" he shouted. "Matter?  What ain't the matter? I'm  wondering why I was such a fool as to come to this God-forsaken country.  If I stay here much longer I'll kill somebody,—myself or one of you!"           

Grover, seating himself in the open doorway, took in the  bloodshot, sleepless eyes and the haggard appearance of the man, and  mentally agreed that he was traveling fast in that direction. There was  a look in his eyes that might have been the beginning of madness.       

"In another month we shall be past the worst of it. I don't  believe the mosquitoes are as bad as they were last week," said Grover  soothingly.       

Jones felt that the other was treating him as he would a sick  child, and resented it with unspoken rage and grinding teeth.       

"When the first steamers break through the ice the mosquitoes—"       

Jones sprang to his feet in a sullen fury, his eyes blazing. The  longing for a fight was on him, but the pretext was lacking.  Before he  could speak, Wood interrupted.  The sickness for home was eating his  heart and had to break through, now that the floodgates of speech were  opened.       

"Jones is right," he said. "The Lord made the rest of the earth,  and when he got through he had some rocks left and piled them here, hit  or miss, because he thought folks had sense enough to stay away from  here. It's no white man's country."       

"It's a frozen fact that I haven't slept a wink for three  nights," cried Jones.  "Half the year it is the eternal cold, and the  other half it is infernal heat and mosquitoes."       

Grover shrugged his shoulders and began to hum "The Star-spangled  Banner." His selection appeared to be unfortunate.       

"Drop it!" cried Wood. "Do the people in hell sing about heaven?"  Then he continued a little shamefacedly, "It is all very well for you  Grover; but I've got a wife and two little kids down in God's country.  If you've got to sing, sing something else. You make me homesick."       

"Well, I'm a little that way myself," remarked the millionaire,  holding his trousers out before him and viewing the artistic patch  critically, his head slewed round a little to one side. "But I never  knew you to kick before, and thought you didn't mind it, Wood."       

"Did you?" cried the other bitterly.  "Well, I do. A man may be  sick without shouting about it all the time. And I'm sick—damn sick. I  haven't sat down once in the last six weeks to these soggy beans and  sour bread without thinking what a fool I was to come. Good Lord!" he  groaned, "I might have been sleeping in a bed to-night—a bed with  springs and a soft mattress; nothing to do but reach out my hand to  touch my wife, and the kids in a crib not three feet away from me. I  might have got up to-morrow morning and eaten eggs for breakfast and  beefsteak that your teeth sink into. I might have had strawberries and  cream from my own ranch. But the best wasn't good enough for me. O no!  I wanted the earth, hooped round with a barb-wire fence or handed me on  a silver platter. Think of it, men! Down in the States they are eating  peas and beans-fresh beans, not this moldy mess—and cabbages and corn,  and strawberries and watermelons—no, watermelons aren't ripe yet, but  bottled beer is on tap all the year round."       

"You two fellows had better run down to the States for the  summer. The magnate and I will stay and look after things," said Grover  gravely.       

"That's right. I've been roughing it twenty years and don't mind  it much," acquiesced the millionaire tailor.       

"I'm no more a *chechocho* than you fellows," Jones  responded. "I've worked as long hours and risked as much and lived as  hard. I've worked all winter underground and asked no odds of anybody.  You have never heard me squealing for the windlass end, I reckon. But  I'm sick of it. By God! if it were not for my mother I'd —"       

He set his teeth with a click and an expression on his face that  was not good to see. It was as if the veil had been lifted and his soul  stood naked for a moment.       

"You're all right, Jones. But you two fellows have a touch of  fever. There really isn't any reason why you shouldn't go home for the  summer," continued Grover, noting the look which had swept over the face  of the other man when he let the bars down. A man does not look like  that unless he has thought of *harikari*.           

"You make me weary," cried Wood.  "I'm not going home till I make  a strike, if I stay till I rot."       

"I'll tell you where I wish I was," said the Englishman, harping  on. "I wish I was in 'Frisco. I'd have a new rig-out, swell as they make  'em,—patent-leather shoes, ice-cream pants, gaudy necktie, and a  billycock to top off with. My word!  then I'd get a girl! You bet she  would be a high-flyer, and we would go together to a feed-shop—best in  town. It wouldn't be beans and bacon I'd order.  I'd have oyster stew  and hot tamales to start the show, then go down the line and finish off  with champagne fizz—in buckets, mind you. Then we would go down to the  Cliff House and listen to the bands play, and see the  what-d'ye-call-'em-scopes that shows moving pictures. There'd likely be  thousands of people moving about and electric lights galore. Gad! but  we'd have a boat and sail out on the bloomin' Pacific while the band  played 'Mandalay' and 'Tommy Atkins'!" and Jones broke into boisterous  song:-     

Bloomin' idol made o' mud-

What they called the Great Gawd  Budd-

Plucky lot she cared for idols when I       

 

Kissed her where she stud!       

On the road to Mandalay,       

Where the old flotilla lay,-     

Then as if there were no break in the song:-But that's all shore  be'ind me—long ago an'       

fur away, An' there ain't no 'buses runnin' from the       

Bank to Mandalay.         

"I used to be a 'Tommy' myself, ye know. It would be a balmy,  velvet time I'd have. I'd paint the town red P.D.Q.  My word!" He ended  with a long-drawn sigh and fell into ecstatic reverie, and Wood took up  the burden of speech:-

"I believe you. Guess we'd all blow  ourselves one way or another. I'd stop at Seattle and go round to some  bank and cash up my chips. Then I'd clean out some toy-shop for the kids  and get my wife the best dress I could find. After that I'd charter a  special boat and go across the lake—Lake Washington, you know—to my  ranch. I reckon they'd never quit hugging me, those blame little kids."  And the man drew a deep breath that was more than half a sob. "Gee! but  I'd like to see little old, hilly Seattle again, with its dirty  water-front and its six-month rains!  But what's the use of talking?  D'ye s'pose Dives enjoyed seeing Lazarus in Abraham's bosom?" concluded  Wood, lapsing into silence and holding himself in tightly.       

All this proved too much for the millionaire, and he now took up  the strain.  "I'll take Denver in mine," said he, waving his nether  garment excitedly. "I've railroaded and mined there twenty years, and  it's the best State there is. You can't tell the truth about it without  lying.  There's a saloon on Arapahoe Street that used to be my  headquarters. I know all the boys about town, and I guess I would be  strictly in it. You can get more fun for your money in Denver than in  any town I know. I'd go up to the First National Bank, just as I am in  these duds —"       

"Then you'd be arrested," broke in Grover; "for—"       

"Shut up! You know what I mean.  I'd wear this same old mackinaw  suit.  I'd tell the cashier I wanted to deposit some money, and he'd say  'How much?'  Then I'd say, kinder casual like, 'Well, I haven't counted  it—about a million, I guess—or maybe two. It's down at the  express-office. You'll need several teams to get it up.' He'd size up my  duds and think I was crazy, or maybe only drunk.  About that time I'd  hand out the express receipt, and if that didn't paralyze him it would  be because he was lightning-proof.  I think I see him wilt."       

"What would you do, Grover?" asked Wood.       

"Take a Turkish bath first thing; next have some clothes made by  a decent tailor.  Then I would run on to my class reunion at old Yale.  After that —"       

The figure of a man blocked the doorway—a man in new brown boots  laced up his legs, new mackinaw suit, new broad hat, in fact a brand new  man just off the St. Michaels boat. Not a tear or a rip about  him—*chechocho* written all over him from head to foot.       

"Good evening, or perhaps I'd better say, 'Good-night,'" he began  jauntily.        "I just came up from St. Michaels. Our  boat is stuck on a sand-bar five miles down,  so I and another fellow rowed up."       

"The deuce you did!"       

Imagine Livingstone when Stanley first showed on the horizon, and  you have some conception of what it meant to these outcasts to see a  face fresh from civilization.  For seven months they had been cut off  from news of the outside world, and here was a man fresh from the  States, as if sent especially by Providence to enlighten them.       

They began promptly, forgetting everything around them and asking  a thousand questions about the war, about politics, about  crops,—anything and everything they could think of. Then they made him  sing the latest songs over and over until they had caught the air and  learned the words. He promised them some old magazines he had on board.  They had been restricted to a tattered copy of the Bible and a fragment  of "The Origin of Species" for twelve months, so they naturally hailed  him as a public benefactor. They made him talk—talk—talk!  At first he  enjoyed it; then it bored him; finally he rebelled.       

"Say, have you fellows got anything to eat?" he asked. "There's  nothing worth eating on the boat—nothing but canned goods and truck.  You don't know what hardship is until you take the St. Michaels River  trip."       

"I presume that's so," said Grover, never twitching a muscle.  "Well, you are through that hardship now, thank Heaven! You shall have a  good square meal to start with—the best we have got."       

They put it before him. He looked in pained surprise at the musty  beans, the soggy bread, the fat bacon, and then asked for coffee.       

"Haven't had any for two months," said Jones.       

"Tea, then."       

Grover shook his head. "Not in stock."       

"But is this what you eat every day?"       

"Yes. I thought it would be a pleasant change for you from the  canned stuff on the boat."       

"I don't believe I'm hungry after all," he said at last.       

"They shouted with laughter and stamped up and down and slapped  each other's backs in an ecstasy of joy till the tears rolled down their  cheeks. They had had their revenge. They, who had endured the horrors of  the trail, the dangers of the river with its cañons and its  rapids, the hardship of a Klondike winter in the frozen North, with its  stampedes over snow-clad mountains, its arduous work in the frozen  ground, and its poor food and wretched shelter,—they, who had risked  death from drowning, from fever, from starvation, from freezing,—they  had been told by a dapper young clerk from the States, with the creases  not yet out of his trousers, that they did not know what hardship was!  It was too good!       

The newcomer interrupted their laughter to make inquiries as to  how far Ladue's claim was from Dawson.       

"I mean to stake out one near his," he said. "It stands to reason  that some of those around must be as rich as his."       

His profound penetration sent Jones off in another shout of  laughter. Grover explained that every river claim within fifty miles of  Ladue's had been staked long ago.       

"That can't be! The company told me there were plenty to be had."       

"Of course the steamboat company told you that. These companies  are the biggest liars on the face of this frozen earth. We tell you that  there aren't any to be had near his."       

"It may be to your interest to tell me that," he said stiffly.       

"All right, my son. No teacher like experience. Better go and  see. You'll be a wiser man in a couple of weeks. My word!" And Jones  flung himself on his bunk, threw out his arms and legs, and kicked in a  frenzy of appreciation of what was before the new-comer.       

At this moment a whistle blew, and the inhabitants of Eagle City  adjourned *en masse* to the banks of the Yukon; for an echo of this  wicked but delightful world was coming up the river to meet them in the  form of a shallow river flatboat.
