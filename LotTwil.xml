THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE TOWN.  
</head>  
<p>  
ONE hundred years' and one ago, in Boston, at ten of the  
clock one April night, a church steeple had been  
climbed and a lantern hung out.  
</p><p>At ten, the same night, in mid-river of the Charles,  
oarsmen two, with passenger silent and grim, had seen the signal  
light out-swung, and rowed with speed for the Charlestown  
shore.  
</p><p>At eleven, the moon was risen, and the grim passenger, Paul  
Revere, had ridden up the Neck, encountered a foe, who opposed  
his ride into the country, and, after a brief delay, rode on,  
leaving a British officer lying in a clay pit.  
</p><p>At mid-night, a hundred ears had heard the flying horseman  
cry, ``Up and arm. The Regulars are coming out!''  
</p><p>You know the story well. You have heard how the wild  
alarm ran from voice to voice and echoed beneath every roof,  
until the men of Lexington and Concord were stirred and  
aroused with patriotic fear for the safety of the public stores that  
had been committed to their keeping.  
</p><p>You know how, long ere the chill April day began to dawn,  
they had drawn, by horse power and by hand power, the cherished  
stores into safe hiding-places in the depth of friendly  
forest-coverts.  
</p><p>There is one thing about that day that you have <hi rend="italic">not</hi> heard  
and I will tell you now. It is, how one little woman staid in  
the town of Concord, whence all the women save her had fled.  
</p><p>All the houses that were standing then, are very old-fashioned now, but there was one dwelling-place on Concord  
Common that was old-fashioned even then! It was the abode of  
   <pb/>   
Martha Moulton and ``Uncle John.'' Just who ``Uncle John''  
was, is not now known, but he was probably Martha Moulton's  
uncle. The uncle, it appears by record, was eighty-five years  
old; while the niece was <hi rend="italic">only</hi> three-score and  
eleven.  
</p><p>Once and again that morning, a friendly hand had pulled  
the latch-string at Martha Moulton's kitchen entrance and  
offered to convey herself and treasures away, but, to either proffer,  
she had said: ``No, I must stay until Uncle John gets the cricks  
out of his back, if all the British soldiers in the land march into  
town.  
</p><p>At last, came Joe Devins, a lad of fifteen years&mdash;Joe's two  
astonished eyes peered for a moment into Martha Moulton's  
kitchen, and then eyes and owner dashed into the room, to learn,  
what the sight he there saw, could mean.  
</p><p>``Whew! Mother Moulton, what are you doing?''  
</p><p>``I'm getting Uncle John his breakfast to be sure, Joe,'' she  
answered. ``Have you seen so many sights this morning that you  
don't know breakfast, when you see it? Have a care there, for  
hot fat <hi rend="italic">will</hi> burn,'' as she deftly poured the  
contents of a pan,  
fresh from the fire, into a dish.  
</p><p>Hungry Joe had been astir since the first drum had beat to  
arms at two of the clock. He gave one glance at the boiling  
cream and the slices of crisp pork swimming in it, as he gasped  
forth the words, ``Getting breakfast in Concord <hi rend="italic">this</hi> morning!  
<hi rend="italic">Mother Moulton</hi>, you <hi rend="italic">must</hi>  
be crazy.''  
</p><p>``So they tell me,'' she said, serenely. ``There comes Uncle  
John!'' she added, as the clatter of a staff on the stone steps of the  
stairway outrang, for an instant, the cries of hurrying and  
confusion that filled the air of the street.  
</p><p>``Don't you know, Mother Moulton,'' Joe went on to say,  
``that every single woman and child have been carried off, where  
the Britishers won't find 'em?''  
   <pb/>   
</p><p>``I don't believe the king's troops have stirred out of  
Boston,'' she replied, going to the door leading to the stone  
staircase, to open it for Uncle John.  
</p><p>``Don't believe it?'' and Joe looked, as he echoed the words,  
as though only a boy could feel sufficient disgust at such want  
of common sense, in full view of the fact, that Reuben Brown  
had just brought the news that eight men had been killed by the  
king's Red-coats, in Lexington, which fact he made haste to  
impart.  
</p><p>``I won't believe a word of it,'' she said, stoutly, ``until I see  
the soldiers coming.''  
</p><p>``Ah! Hear that!'' cried Joe, tossing back his hair and  
swinging his arms triumphantly at an airy foe. ``You won't  
have to wait long. <hi rend="italic">That signal</hi> is for the minute  
men. They  
are going to march out to meet the Red-coats. Wish I was a  
minute man, this minute.''  
</p><p>Meanwhile, poor Uncle John was getting down the steps of  
the stairway, with many a grimace and groan. As he touched  
the floor, Joe, his face beaming with excitement and enthusiasm,  
sprang to place a chair for him at the table, saying, ``Good morning!''  
at the same moment.  
</p><p>``May be,'' groaned Uncle John, ``youngsters <hi rend="italic">like  
you</hi> may  
think it is a good morning, but I <hi rend="italic">don't</hi>, such a din  
and clatter as  
the fools have kept up all night long. If I had the power'' (and  
now the poor old man fairly groaned with rage), ``I'd make 'em  
quiet long enough to let an old man get a wink of sleep, when  
the rheumatism lets go.''  
</p><p>``I'm real sorry for you,'' said Joe, ``but you don't know the  
news. The king's troops, from camp, in Boston, are marching  
right down here, to carry off all our arms that they can find.''  
</p><p>``Are they?'' was the sarcastic rejoined. ``It's the best news  
I've heard in a long while. Wish they had my arms, this min-   <pb/>   
ute. They wouldn't carry them a step farther than they could  
help, I know. Run and tell them mine are ready, Joe.''  
</p><p>``But, Uncle John, wait till after breakfast, you'll want to  
use them once more,'' said Martha Moulton, trying to help him  
into the chair that Joe had placed on the white sanded floor.  
</p><p>Meanwhile, Joe Devins had ears for all the sounds that  
penetrated the kitchen from out of doors, and he had eyes for  
the slices of well-browned pork and the golden hued Johnny-cake lying before the glowing coals on the broad hearth.  
</p><p>As the little woman bent to take up the breakfast, Joe, intent  
on doing some kindness for her in the way of saving treasures,  
asked, ``Shan't I help you, Mother Moulton?''  
</p><p>``I reckon I am not so old that I can't lift a mite of  
cornbread,'' she replied with chilling severity.  
</p><p>``Oh, I didn't mean to lift <hi rend="italic">that thing</hi>,'' he  
made haste to  
explain, ``but to carry off things and hide 'em away, as everybody  
else has been doing half the night. I know a first-rate place up  
in the woods. Used to be a honey tree, you know, and it's just as  
hollow as anything. Silver spoons and things would be just  
as safe in it&mdash;'' but Joe's words were interrupted by unusual  
tumult on the street and he ran off to learn the news, intending  
to return and get the breakfast that had been offered to him.  
</p><p>Presently he rushed back to the house with cheeks aflame  
and eyes ablaze with excitement. ``They're a coming!'' he cried.  
``They're in sight down by the rocks. They see 'em marching,  
the men on the hill, do!''  
</p><p>``You don't mean that its really true that the soldiers are  
coming here, <hi rend="italic">right into our town</hi>,'' cried Martha  
Moulton, rising  
in haste and bringing together with rapid flourishes to right  
and to left, every fragment of silver on the table. Uncle John  
strove to hold fast his individual spoon, but she twitched it with-   <pb/>   
out ceremony out from his rheumatic old fingers, and ran next to  
the parlor cupboard, wherein lay her movable valuables.  
</p><p>``What in the world shall I do with them,'' she cried,  
returning with her apron well filled with treasures, and borne  
down by the weight thereof.  
</p><p>``Give 'em to me,'' cried Joe. ``Here's a basket, drop 'em  
in, and I'll run like a brush-fire through the town and across the  
old bridge, and hide 'em as safe as a weasel's nap.''  
</p><p>Joe's fingers were creamy; his mouth was half filled with  
Johnny-cake, and his pocket on the right bulged to its utmost  
capacity with the same, as he held forth the basket; but the little  
woman was afraid to trust him, as she had been afraid to trust  
her neighbors.  
</p><p>``No! No!'' she replied, to his repeated offers. ``I know  
what I'll do. You, Joe Devins, stay right where you are till I  
come back, and, don't you ever <hi rend="italic">look</hi> out of the  
window.''  
</p><p>``Dear, dear me!'' she cried, flushed and anxious when she  
was out of sight of Uncle John and Joe. I <hi rend="italic">wish</hi> I'd  
given 'em to  
Col. Barrett when he was here before daylight, only, I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> afraid  
I should never get sight of them again.''  
</p><p>She drew off one of her stockings, filled it, tied the opening  
at the top with a string-plunged stocking and all into a pail  
full of water and proceeded to pour the contents into the well.  
</p><p>Just as the dark circle had closed over the blue stockings,  
Joe Devin's face peered down the depths by her side, and his  
voice sounded out the words: ``O Mother Moulton, the British  
will search the wells the <hi rend="italic">very</hi> first thing. Of  
course, they <hi rend="italic">expect</hi>  
to find things in wells!''  
</p><p>``Why didn't you tell me before, Joe? but now it is too late.''  
</p><p>``I would, if I'd known what you was going to do; they'd  
been a sight safer, in the honey tree.''  
   <pb/>   
</p><p>``Yes, and what a fool I've been&mdash;flung <hi rend="italic">my  
watch</hi> into the  
well with the spoons!''  
</p><p>``Well, well! Don't stand there, looking,'' as she hovered  
over the high curb, with her hand on the bucket. Everybody  
will know, if you do, there.''  
</p><p>``Martha! Martha?'' shrieked Uncle John's quavering voice  
from the house door.  
</p><p>``Bless my heart!'' she exclaimed, hurrying back over the  
stones.  
</p><p>``What's the matter with your heart?'' questioned Joe.  
</p><p>``Nothing. I was thinking of Uncle John's money,'' she answered.  
</p><p>``Has he got money?'' cried Joe. ``I thought he was poor,  
and you took care of him because you were so good''  
</p><p>Not one word that Joe uttered did the little woman hear.  
She was already by Uncle John's side and asking him for the  
key to his strong box.  
</p><p>Uncle John's rheumatism was terribly exasperating. ``No,  
I won't give it to you!'' he cried, ``and nobody shall have it as  
long as I'm above ground.''  
</p><p>``Then the soldiers will carry it off,'' she said.  
</p><p>``Let 'em!'' was his reply, grasping his staff firmly with both  
hands and gleaming defiance out of his wide, pale eyes. ``<hi rend="italic">You</hi>  
won't get the key, even if they do.''  
</p><p>At this instant, a voice at the doorway shouted the words,  
``Hide, hide away somewhere, Mother Moulton, for the Red-coats are in sight this minute!''  
</p><p>She heard the warning, and giving one glance at Uncle  
John, which look was answered by another, ``no, you won't  
have it,'' she grasped Joe Devins by the collar of his jacket and  
thrust him before her up the staircase, so quickly that the boy  
   <pb/>   
had no chance to speak, until she released her hold at the  
entrance to Uncle John's room.  
</p><p>The idea of being taken prisoner in such a manner, and by  
a woman, too, was too much for the lad's endurance. ``Let me  
go?'' he cried, the instant he could recover his breath. ``I won't  
hide away in your garret, like a woman, I won't. I want to see  
the militia and the minute men fight the troops, I do.''  
</p><p>``Help me first, Joe. Here, quick now; let's get this box  
out and up garret. We'll hide it under the corn and it'll be  
safe,'' she coaxed.  
</p><p>The box was under Uncle John's bed.  
</p><p>``What's in the old thing any how?'' questioned Joe, pulling  
with all his strength at it.  
</p><p>The box, or chest, was painted red, and was bound about by  
massive iron bands.  
</p><p>``I've never seen the inside of it,'' said Mother Moulton.  
``It holds the poor old soul's sole treasure, and I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> want to save  
it for him if I can.''  
</p><p>They had drawn it with much hard endeavor, as far as the  
garret stairs, but their united strength failed to lift it. ``Heave  
it, now!'' cried Joe, and lo! it was up two steps. So they turned  
it over and over with many a thudding thump; every one of  
which thumps Uncle John heard, and believed to be strokes upon  
the box itself to burst it asunder, until it was fairly shelved on  
the garret floor.  
</p><p>In the very midst of the overturnings, a voice from below  
had been heard crying out, ``Let my box alone! Don't break it  
open. If you do, I'll&mdash;I'll&mdash;'' but, whatever the poor man  
<hi rend="italic">meant</hi> to threaten as a penalty, he could not think  
of anything  
half severe enough to say and so left it uncertain as to the  
punishment that might be looked for.  
</p><p>``Poor old soul!'' ejaculated the little woman, her soft white  
   <pb/>   
curls in disorder and the pink color rising from her cheeks to  
her fair forehead, as she bent to help Joe drag the box beneath  
the rafter's edge.  
</p><p>``Now, Joe,'' she said. ``we'll heap nubbins over it, and if the  
soldiers want corn they'll take good ears and never think of  
touching poor nubbins; so they fell to work throwing corn over  
the red chest, until it was completely concealed from view.  
</p><p>Then he sprang to the high-up-window ledge in the point of  
the roof and took one glance out. ``Oh, I see them, the Red-coats. True's I live, there go the militia <hi rend="italic">up the  
hill</hi>. I thought  
they was going to stand and defend. Shame on 'em, I say.''  
Jumping down and crying back to Mother Moulton, ``I'm going  
to stand by the minute men,'' he went down, three steps at a leap,  
and nearly overturned Uncle John on the stairs, who, with many  
groans was trying to get to the defense of his strong box.  
</p><p>``What did you help her for, you scamp,'' he demanded of  
Joe, flourishing his staff unpleasantly near the lad's head.  
</p><p>`` 'Cause she asked me to, and couldn't do it alone,'' returned  
Joe, dodging the stick and disappearing from the scene, at the  
very moment Martha Moulton encountered Uncle John.  
</p><p>``Your strong box is safe under nubbins in the garret,  
unless the house burns down, and now that you are up here, you  
had better stay,'' she added soothingly, as she hastened by him  
to reach the kitchen below.  
</p><p>Once there, she paused a second or two to take resolution  
regarding her next act. She knew full well that there was not  
one second to spare, and yet she stood looking, apparently, into  
the glowing embers on the hearth. She was flushed and excited,  
both by the unwonted toil, and the coming events, Cobwebs  
from the rafters had fallen on her hair and home-spun dress,  
and would readily have betrayed her late occupation, to any  
discerning soldier of the king.  
   <pb/>   
</p><p>A smile broke suddenly over her face, displacing for a brief  
second every trace of care. ``It's my only weapon, and I must  
use it,'' she said, making a stately courtesy to an imaginary guest  
and straightway disappeared within an adjoining room. With  
buttoned door and dropped curtains the little woman made haste  
to array herself in her finest raiment. In five minutes she  
reappeared in the kitchen, a picture pleasant to look at. In all New  
England, there could not be a more beautiful little old lady than  
Martha Moulton was that day. Her hair was guiltless now of  
cobwebs, but haloed her face with fluffy little curls of silvery  
whiteness, above which, like a crown, was a little cap of dotted  
muslin, pure as snow. Her erect figure, not a particle of the  
hard-working-day in it now, carried well the folds of a sheeny,  
black silk gown, over which she had tied an apron as spotless as  
the cap.  
</p><p>As she fastened back her gown and hurried away the signs  
of the breakfast she had not eaten, the clear pink tints seemed  
to come out with added beauty of coloring in her cheeks; while  
her hair seemed fairer and whiter than at any moment in her  
three-score and eleven years.  
</p><p>Once more Joe Devins looked in. As he caught a glimpse  
of the picture she made, he paused to cry out: ``All dressed up  
to meet the robbers! My, how fine you do look! I wouldn't.  
I'd go and hide behind the nubbins. They'll be here in less than  
five minutes now,'' he cried, ``and I'm going over the North  
Bridge to see what's going on there.''  
</p><p>``O Joe, stay, won't you?'' she urged, but the lad was gone,  
and she was left alone to meet the foe, comforting herself with  
the thought, ``They'll treat me with more respect if I <hi rend="italic">look</hi>  
respectable, and if I must die, I'll die good-looking in my best  
clothes, anyhow.''  
</p><p>She threw a few sticks of hickory-wood on the embers, and  
   <pb/>   
then drew out the little round stand, on which the family Bible  
was always lying. Recollecting that the British soldiers  
probably belonged to the Church of England, she hurried away to  
fetch Uncle John's ``prayer-book.''  
</p><p>``They'll have respect to me, if they find me reading that, I  
know,'' she thought. Having drawn the round stand within  
sight of the well, and where she could also command a view of  
the staircase, she sat and waited for coming events.  
</p><p>Uncle John was keeping watch of the advancing troops  
from an upper window. ``Martha,'' he called, ``you'd better  
come up. They're close by, now.'' To tell the truth, Uncle  
John himself was a little afraid; that is to say he hadn't quite  
courage enough to go down, and, perhaps, encounter his own  
rheumatism and the king's soldiers on the same stairway, and yet,  
he felt that he must defend Martha as well as he could.  
</p><p>The rap of a musket, quick and ringing on the front door,  
startled the little woman from her apparent devotions. She  
did not move at the call of anything so profane. It was the  
custom of the time to have the front door divided into two parts,  
the lower half and the upper half. The former was closed and  
made fast, the upper could be swung open at will.  
</p><p>The soldier getting no reply, and doubtless thinking that the  
house was deserted, leaped over the chained lower half of the  
door.  
</p><p>At the clang of his bayonet against the brass trimmings,  
Martha Moulton groaned in spirit, for, if there was any one  
thing that she deemed essential to her comfort in this life, it was  
to keep spotless, speckless and in every way unharmed, the great  
knocker on her front door.  
</p><p>``Good, sound English metal, too,'' she thought, ``that an  
English soldier ought to know how to respect.''  
</p><p>As she heard the tramp of coming feet she only bent the  
   <pb/>   
closer over the Book of Prayer that lay open on her knee. Not  
one word did she read or see; she was inwardly trembling and  
outwardly watching the well and the staircase. But now, above  
all other sounds, broke the noise of Uncle John's staff thrashing  
the upper step of the staircase, and the shrill tremulous cry of  
the old man defiant, doing his utmost for the defense of his  
castle.  
</p><p>The fingers that lay beneath the book tingled with desire  
to box the old man's ears, for the policy he was pursuing would  
be fatal to the treasure in garret and in well; but she was forced  
to silence and inactivity.  
</p><p>As the King's troops, Major Pitcairn at their head, reached  
the open door and saw the old lady, they paused. What could  
they do but look, for a moment, at the unexpected sight that met  
their view; a placid old lady in black silk and dotted muslin,  
with all the sweet solemnity of morning devotion hovering about  
the tidy apartment and seeming to centre at the round stand by  
which she sat, this pretty woman, with pink and white face  
surmounted with fleecy little curls and crinkles and wisps of floating  
whiteness, who looked up to meet their gaze with such innocent  
prayer-suffused eyes.  
</p><p>``Good morning, Mother,'' said Major Pitcairn, raising his  
hat.  
</p><p>``Good morning, gentlemen and soldiers,'' returned Martha  
Moulton. ``You will pardon my not meeting you at the door,  
when you see that I was occupied in rendering service to the  
Lord of all.'' She reverently closed the book, laid it on the  
table, and arose, with a stately bearing, to demand their wishes.  
</p><p>``We're hungry, good woman,'' spoke the commander, ``and  
your hearth is the only hospitable one we've seen since we left  
Boston. With your good leave I'll take a bit of this, and he  
   <pb/>   
stooped to lift up the Johnny-cake that had been all this while  
on the hearth.  
</p><p>``I wish I had something better to offer you,'' she said,  
making haste to fetch plates and knives from the corner-cupboard,  
and all the while she was keeping eye-guard over the well. ``I'm  
afraid the Concorders haven't left much for you to-day,'' she  
added, with a soft sigh of regret, as though she really felt sorry  
that such brave men and good soldiers had fallen on hard times  
in the ancient town. At the moment she had brought forth  
bread and baked beans, and was putting them on the table, a  
voice rang into the room, causing every eye to turn toward Uncle  
John. He had gotten down the stairs without uttering one audible  
groan, and was standing, one step above the floor of the room,  
brandishing and whirling his staff about in a manner to cause  
even rheumatism to flee the place, while, at the top of his voice  
he cried out:  
</p><p>``Martha Moulton, how <hi rend="italic">dare</hi> you <hi rend="italic">feed</hi> these&mdash;these&mdash;  
monsters&mdash;in human form!''  
</p><p>``Don't mind him, gentlemen, <hi rend="italic">please</hi> don't,''  
she made haste  
to say, ``he's old, <hi rend="italic">very</hi> old; eighty-five, his last  
birthday, and&mdash;a  
little hoity-toity at times,'' pointing deftly with her finger in the  
region of the reasoning powers in her own shapely head.  
</p><p>Summoning Major Pitcairn by an offer of a dish of beans,  
she contrived to say, under covert of it:  
</p><p>``You see, sir, I couldn't go away and leave him; he is  
almost distracted with rheumatism, and this excitement to-day will  
kill him, I'm afraid.''  
</p><p>Advancing toward the staircase with bold and soldierly  
front, Major Pitcairn said to Uncle John:  
</p><p>``Stand aside, old man, and we'll hold you harmless.''  
</p><p>``I don't believe you will, you red-trimmed trooper, you,''  
   <pb/>   
was the reply; and, with a dexterous swing of the wooden staff,  
he mowed off and down three military hats.  
</p><p>Before any one had time to speak, Martha Moulton adroitly  
stooping, as though to recover Major Pitcairn's hat, which had  
rolled to her feet, swung the stairway-door into its place with a  
resounding bang, and followed up that achievement with a swift  
turn of two large wooden buttons, one high up, and the other  
low down, near the floor.  
</p><p>``There!'' she said, ``he is safe out of mischief for awhile,  
and your heads are safe as well. Pardon a poor old man, who  
does not know what he is about.''  
</p><p>``He seems to know remarkably well,'' exclaimed an officer.  
</p><p>Meanwhile, behind the strong door, Uncle John's wrath  
knew no bounds. In his frantic endeavors to burst the fastenings  
of the wooden buttons, rheumatic cramps siezed{sic} him and  
carried the day, leaving him out of the battle.  
</p><p>Meanwhile, a portion of the soldiery clustered about the  
door. The king's horses were fed within five feet of the great  
brass knocker, while, within the house, the beautiful little old  
woman, in her Sunday-best-raiment, tried to do the dismal honors  
of the day to the foes of her country. Watching her, one would  
have thought she was entertaining heroes returned from the  
achievement of valiant deeds, whereas, in her own heart, she  
knew full well that she was giving a little to save much.  
</p><p>Nothing could exceed the seeming alacrity with which she  
fetched water from the well for the officers: and, when Major  
Pitcairn gallantly ordered his men to do the service, the little  
soul was in alarm; she was so afraid that ``somehow, in some  
way or another, the blue stocking would get hitched on to the  
bucket.'' She knew that she must to its rescue, and so she bravely  
acknowledged herself to have taken a vow (when, she did not  
say), to draw all the water that was taken from that well.  
   <pb/>   
</p><p>``A remnant of witchcraft!'' remarked a soldier within  
hearing.  
</p><p>``Do I look like a witch?'' she demanded.  
</p><p>``If you do,'' replied Major Pitcairn, ``I admire New  
England witches, and never would condemn one to be hung, or  
burned, or&mdash;smothered.''  
</p><p>Martha Moulton never wore so brilliant a color on her aged  
cheeks as at that moment. She felt bitter shame at the ruse she  
had attempted, but silver spoons were precious, and, to escape  
the smile that went around at Major Pitcairn's words, she was  
only too glad to go again to the well and dip slowly the high,  
over-hanging sweep into the cool, clear, dark depth below.  
</p><p>During this time the cold, frosty morning spent itself into  
the brilliant, shining noon.  
</p><p>You know what happened at Concord on that 19th of April  
in the year 1775. You have been told the story, how the men  
of Acton met and resisted the king's troops at the old North  
Bridge, how brave Captain Davis and minute-man Hosmer fell,  
how the sound of their falling struck down to the very heart of  
mother earth, and caused her to send forth her brave sons to cry  
``Liberty, or Death!''  
</p><p>And the rest of the story; the sixty or more barrels of flour  
that the king's troops found and struck the heads from, leaving  
the flour in condition to be gathered again at nightfall, the arms  
and powder that they destroyed, the houses they burned; all  
these, are they not recorded in every child's history in the land?  
</p><p>While these things were going on, for a brief while, at mid-day, Martha Moulton found her home deserted. She had not  
forgotten poor, suffering, irate Uncle John in the regions above,  
and, so, the very minute she had the chance, she made a strong  
cup of catnip tea (the real tea, you know, was brewing in Boston  
harbor).  
   <pb/>   
</p><p>She turned the buttons, and, with a bit of trembling at her  
heart, such as she had not felt all day, she ventured up the stairs,  
bearing the steaming peace-offering before her.  
</p><p>Uncle John was writhing under the sharp thorns and  
twinges of his old enemy, and in no frame of mind to receive any  
overtures in the shape of catnip tea; nevertheless, he was watching,  
as well as he was able, the motions of the enemy. As she  
drew near he cried out:  
</p><p>``Look out this window, and see! Much <hi rend="italic">good</hi>  
all your  
scheming will do <hi rend="italic">you!</hi>''  
</p><p>She obeyed his command to look, and the sight she then saw  
caused her to let fall the cup of catnip tea and rush down the  
stairs, wringing her hands as she went and crying out:  
</p><p>``Oh, dear! what shall I do? The house will burn and the  
box up garret. Everything's lost!''  
</p><p>Major Pitcairn, at that moment, was on the green in front  
of her door, giving orders.  
</p><p>Forgetting the dignified part she intended to play, forgetting  
everything but the supreme danger that was hovering in  
mid-air over her home&mdash;the old house wherein she had been  
born, and the only home she had ever known&mdash;she rushed out  
upon the green, amid the troops, and surrounded by cavalry, and  
made her way to Major Pitcairn.  
</p><p>``The town-house is on fire!'' she cried, laying her hand upon  
the commander's arm.  
</p><p>He turned and looked at her. Major Pitcairn had recently  
learned that the task he had been set to do in the provincial towns  
that day was not an easy one; that, when hard pressed and trodden  
down, the despised rustics, in home-spun dress, could sting  
even English soldiers; and thus it happened that, when he felt  
the touch of Mother Moulton's plump little old fingers on his  
military sleeve. he was not in the pleasant humor that he had  
   <pb/>   
been, when the same hand had ministered to his hunger in the  
early morning.  
</p><p>``Well, what of it? <hi rend="italic">Let it burn!</hi> We won't  
hurt you, if  
you go in the house and stay there!''  
</p><p>She turned and glanced up at the court-house. Already  
flames were issuing from it. ``Go in the house and let it burn,  
<hi rend="italic">indeed!</hi>'' thought she. ``He knows me, don't he? Oh,  
sir! for  
the love of Heaven won't you stop it?'' she said, entreatingly.  
</p><p>``Run in the house, good mother. That is a wise woman,''  
he advised.  
</p><p>Down in her heart, and as the very outcome of lip and brain  
she wanted to say, ``You needn't `mother' me, you murderous  
rascal!'' but, remembering everything that was at stake, she  
crushed her wrath and buttoned it in as closely as she had Uncle  
John behind the door in the morning, and again, with swift  
gentleness, laid her hand on his arm.  
</p><p>He turned and looked at her. Vexed at her persistence,  
and extremely annoyed at intelligence that had just reached him  
from the North Bridge, he said, imperiously, ``Get away! or  
you'll be trodden down by the horses!''  
</p><p>``I <hi rend="italic">can't</hi> go!'' she cried, clasping his arm,  
and fairly clinging  
to it in her frenzy of excitement. ``Oh stop the fire, quick,  
quick! or my house will burn!''  
</p><p>I have no time to put out your fires,'' he said, carelessly,  
shaking loose from her hold and turning to meet a messenger  
with news.  
</p><p>Poor little woman! What could she do? The wind was  
rising, and the fire grew. Flame was creeping out in a little  
blue curl in a new place, under the rafter's edge, <hi rend="italic">and  
nobody  
cared</hi>. That was what increased the pressing misery of it all.  
It was so unlike a common country alarm, where everybody  
rushed up and down the streets, crying ``Fire! fire! f-i-r-e!'' and  
   <pb/>   
went hurrying to and fro for pails of water to help put it out.  
Until that moment the little woman did not know how  
utterly deserted she was.  
</p><p>In very despair, she ran to her house, seized two pails, filled  
them with greater haste than she had ever drawn water before,  
and, regardless of Uncle John's imprecations, carried them forth,  
one in either hand, the water dripping carelessly down the side  
breadths of her fair silk gown, her silvery curls tossed and  
tumbled in white confusion, her pleasant face aflame with eagerness,  
and her clear eyes suffused with tears.  
</p><p>Thus equipped with facts and feeling, she once more  
appeared to Major Pitcairn.  
</p><p>``Have you a mother in old England?'' she cried. ``If so,  
for her sake, stop this fire.''  
</p><p>Her words touched his heart.  
</p><p>``And if I do&mdash;?'' he answered.  
</p><p>``<hi rend="italic">Then your johnny-cake on my hearth won't burn  
up</hi>,'' she  
said, with a quick little smile, adjusting her cap.  
</p><p>Major Pitcairn laughed, and two soldiers, at his command,  
seized the pails and made haste to the court-house, followed by  
many more.  
</p><p>For awhile the fire seemed victorious, but, by brave effort,  
it was finally overcome, and the court-house saved.  
</p><p>At a distance Joe Devins had noticed the smoke hovering  
like a little cloud, then sailing away still more like a cloud over  
the town; and he had made haste to the scene, arriving in time to  
venture on the roof, and do good service there.  
</p><p>After the fire was extinguished, he thought of Martha  
Moulton, and he could not help feeling a bit guilty at the  
consciousness that he had gone off and left her alone.  
</p><p>Going to the house he found her entertaining the king's  
troopers with the best food her humble store afforded.  
   <pb/>   
</p><p>She was so charmed with herself, and so utterly well pleased  
with the success of her pleading, that the little woman's nerves  
fairly quivered with jubilation; and best of all, the blue stocking  
was still safe in the well, for had she not watched with her own  
eyes every time the bucket was dipped to fetch up water for the  
fire, having, somehow, got rid of the vow she had taken regarding  
the drawing of the water.  
</p><p>As she saw the lad looking, with surprised countenance, into  
the room where the feast was going on, a fear crept up her own  
face and darted out from her eyes. It was, lest Joe Devins  
should spoil it all by ill-timed words.  
</p><p>She made haste to meet him, basket in hand.  
</p><p>``Here, Joe,'' she said, ``fetch me some small wood, there's  
a good boy.''  
</p><p>As she gave him the basket she was just in time to stop the  
rejoinder that was issuing from his lips.  
</p><p>In time to intercept his return she was at the wood-pile.  
</p><p>``Joe,'' she said, half-abashed before the truth that shone in  
the boy's eyes, ``Joe,'' she repeated, ``you know Major Pitcairn  
ordered the fire put out, <hi rend="italic">to please me</hi>, because I  
begged him so,  
and, in return, what <hi rend="italic">can</hi> I do but give them  
something to eat.  
Come and help me.''  
</p><p>``I won't,'' responded Joe. ``Their hands are red with  
blood. They've killed two men at the bridge.''  
</p><p>``Who's killed?'' she asked, trembling, but Joe would not  
tell her. He demanded to know what had been done with Uncle  
John.  
</p><p>``He's quiet enough, up-stairs,'' she replied, with a sudden  
spasm of feeling that she <hi rend="italic">had</hi> neglected Uncle John  
shamefully;  
still, with the day, and the fire and everything, how could she  
help it? but, really, it did seem strange that he made no noise,  
with a hundred armed men coming and going through the house.  
   <pb/>   
</p><p>At least, that was what Joe thought, and, having deposited  
the basket of wood on the threshold of the kitchen door, he  
departed around the corner of the house. Presently he had  
climbed a pear-tree, dropped from one of its overhanging  
branches on the lean-to, raised a sash and crept into the window.  
</p><p>Slipping off his shoes, heavy with spring-mud, he proceeded  
to search for Uncle John. He was not in his own room; he was  
not in the guest-chamber; he was not in any one of the rooms.  
</p><p>On the floor, by the window in the hall, looking out upon  
the green, he found the broken cup and saucer that Martha  
Moulton had let fall. Having made a second round, in which  
he investigated every closet and penetrated into the spaces under  
beds, Joe thought of the garret.  
</p><p>Tramp, tramp went the heavy feet on the sanded floors below,  
drowning every possible sound from above; nevertheless, as  
the lad opened the door leading into the garret, he whispered  
cautiously: ``Uncle John! Uncle John!''  
</p><p>All was silent above. Joe went up, and was startled by a  
groan. He had to stand a few seconds, to let the darkness grow  
into light, ere he could see; and, when he could discern outlines  
in the dimness, there was given to him the picture of Uncle John,  
lying helpless amid and upon the nubbins that had been piled  
over his strong box.  
</p><p>``Why, Uncle John, are you dead?'' asked Joe, climbing  
over to his side.  
</p><p>``Is the house afire?'' was the response.  
</p><p>``House afire? No! The confounded red-coats up and  
put it out.''  
</p><p>``I thought they was going to let me burn to death up here!''  
groaned Uncle John.  
</p><p>``Can I help you up?'' and Joe proffered two strong hands,  
rather black with toil and smoke.  
   <pb/>   
</p><p>``No, no! You can't help me. If the house isn't afire, I'll  
stand it till the fellows are gone, and then, Joe you fetch the  
doctor as quick as you can.''  
</p><p>``<hi rend="italic">You</hi> can't get a doctor for love nor money  
this night, Uncle  
John. There's too much work to be done in Lexington and Concord  
to-night for wounded and dying men; and there'll be more  
of 'em too afore a single red-coat sees Boston again. They'll be  
hunted down every step of the way. They've killed Captain  
Davis, from Acton.''  
</p><p>``You don't say so!''  
</p><p>``Yes, they have, and&mdash;''  
</p><p>``I say, Joe Devins, go down and do-do something. There's  
<hi rend="italic">my niece</hi>, a-feeding the murderers! I'll disown her.  
She shan't  
have a penny of my pounds, she shan't!''  
</p><p>Both Joe and Uncle John were compelled to remain in  
inaction, while below, the weary little woman acted the kind  
hostess to His Majesty's troops.  
</p><p>But now the feast was spent, and the soldiers were  
summoned to begin their painful march. Assembled on the green,  
all was ready, when Major Pitcairn, remembering the little  
woman who had ministered to his wants, returned to the house  
to say farewell.  
</p><p>'Twas but a step to her door, and but a moment since he had  
left it, but he found her crying; crying with joy, in the very  
chair where he had found her at prayers in the morning.  
</p><p>``I would like to say good-by,'' he said; ``you've been very  
kind to me to-day.''  
</p><p>With a quick dash or two of the dotted white apron  
(spotless no longer) to her eye, she arose. Major Pitcairn extended  
his hand, but she folded her own closely together, and said:  
</p><p>``I wish you a pleasant journey back to Boston, sir.''  
</p><p>``Will you not shake hands with me before I go?''  
   <pb/>   
</p><p>``I can feed the enemy of my country, but shake hands with  
him, <hi rend="italic">never!</hi>''  
</p><p>For the first time that day, the little woman's love of country  
seemed to rise triumphant within her, and drown every impulse  
to selfishness; or was it the nearness to safety that she felt?  
Human conduct is the result of so many motives that it is  
sometimes impossible to name the compound, although on that  
occasion Martha Moulton labelled it ``Patriotism.''  
</p><p>``And yet I put out the fire for you,'' he said.  
</p><p>``For your mother's sake, in old England, it was, you  
remember, sir.''  
</p><p>``I remember,'' said Major Pitcairn, with a sigh, as he  
turned away.  
</p><p>``And for <hi rend="italic">her</hi> sake I will shake hands with  
you,'' said  
Martha Moulton.  
</p><p>So he turned back, and across the threshold, in presence of  
the waiting troops, the commander of the expedition to Concord,  
and the only woman in the town, shook hands at parting.  
</p><p>Martha Moulton saw Major Pitcairn mount his horse;  
heard the order given for the march to begin,&mdash;the march of  
which you all have heard. You know what a sorry time the Red-coats had of it in getting back to Boston; how they were fought  
at every inch of the way, and waylaid from behind every  
convenient tree-trunk, and shot at from tree-tops, and aimed at from  
upper windows, and beseiged from behind stone walls, and, in  
short, made so miserable and harassed and overworn, that at last  
their depleted ranks, with the tongues of the men parched and  
hanging, were fain to lie down by the road-side and take what  
came next, even though it might be death. And then <hi rend="italic">the  
dead</hi>  
they left behind them!  
</p><p>Ah! there's nothing wholesome to mind or body about war,  
until long, long after it is over, and the earth has had time to  
   <pb/>   
hide the blood, and send it forth in sweet blooms of liberty, with  
forget-me-nots springing thick between.  
</p><p>The men of that day are long dead. The same soil holds  
regulars and minute-men. England, who over-ruled, and the  
provinces, that put out brave hands to seize their rights, are good  
friends to-day, and have shaken hands over many a threshold of  
hearty thought and kind deeds since that time.  
</p><p>The tree of Liberty grows yet, stately and fair, for the men  
of the Revolution planted it well and surely. God himself <hi rend="italic">hath</hi>  
given it increase. So we gather to-day, in this our story, a forget-me-not more, from the old town of Concord.  
</p><p>When the troops had marched away, the weary little  
woman laid aside her silken gown, resumed her homespun dress,  
and immediately began to think of getting Uncle John down-stairs again into his easy chair; but it required more aid than  
she could give to lift the fallen man. At last Joe Devins  
summoned returning neighbors, who came to the rescue, and the  
poor nubbins were left to the rats once more.  
</p><p>Joe climbed down the well and rescued the blue stocking,  
with its treasures unharmed, even to the precious watch, which  
watch was Martha Moulton's chief treasure, and one of very few  
in the town.  
</p><p>Martha Moulton was the heroine of the day. The house  
was beseiged by admiring men and women that night and for  
two or three days thereafter; but when, years later, she being  
older, and poorer, even to want, petitioned the General Court  
for a reward for the service she rendered in persuading Major  
Pitcairn to save the court-house from burning, there was granted  
to her only fifteen dollars, a poor little forget-me-not, it is true,

THE CONQUEST OF FAIRYLAND.  
</head>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>THERE reigned a king in the land of Persia, mighty and great was he grown,</l>  
<l>On the necks of the kings of the conquered earth he builded up his throne.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>There sate a king on the throne of Persia; and he was grown so proud</l>  
<l>That all the life of the world was less to him than a passing cloud.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>He reigned in glory: joy and sorrow lying between his hands.</l>  
<l>If he sighed a nation shook, his smile ripened the harvest of lands.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>He was the saddest man beneath the everlasting sky,</l>  
<l>For all his glories had left him old, and the proudest king must die.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>He who was even as God to all the nations of men,</l>  
<l>Must die as the merest peasant dies, and turn into earth again.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>And his life with the fear of death was bitter and sick and accursed,</l>  
<l>As brackish water to drink of which is to be forever athirst.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>The hateful years rolled on and on, but once it chanced at noon</l>  
<l>The drowsy court was thrilled to gladness, it echoed so sweet a tune.</l>  
</lg>  
   <pb/>   
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Low as the lapping of tile sea, as the song of the lark is clear,</l>  
<l>Wild as the moaning of pine branches; the king was fain to hear..</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>``What is the song, and who is the singer?'' he said; ``before the throne</l>  
<l>Let him come, for the songs of the world are mine, and all but this are known.''</l>  
</lg>  
  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Seven mighty kings went out the minstrel man to find:</l>  
<l>And all they found was a dead cyprus soughing in the wind.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>And slower still, and sadder still the heavy winters rolled,</l>  
<l>And the burning summers waned away, and the king grew very old;</l>  
</lg>  
   <pb/>   
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Dull, worn, feeble, bent; and once he thought, ``to die</l>  
<l>Were rest, at least.'' And as he thought the music wandered by.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Into the presence of the king, singing, the singer came,</l>  
<l>And his face was like the spring in flower, his eyes were clear as flame.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>``What is the song you play, and what the theme your praises sing?</l>  
<l>It is sweet; I knew not I owned a thing so sweet,'' said the weary king.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>``I sing my country,'' said the singer, ``a land that is sweeter than song.''</l>  
<l>``Which of my kingdoms is your country? Thither would I along.''</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>``Great, O king, is thy power, and the earth a footstool for thy feet;</l>  
<l>But my country is free, and my own country, and oh, my country is sweet!''</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>As he heard the eyes of the king grew young and alive with fire</l>  
<l>``Lo, is there left on the earth a thing to strive for, a thing to desire?</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>``Where is thy country? tell me, O singer, speak thine innermost heart!</l>  
<l>Leave thy music! speak plainly! Speak-forget thine art!''</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>The eyes of the singer shone as he sang, and his voice rang wild and free</l>  
<l>As the elemental wind or the uncontrollable sobs of the sea.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>``O my distant home!'' he sighed; ``Oh, alas! away and afar</l>  
<l>I watch thee now as a lost sailor watches a shining star.</l>  
</lg>  
   <pb/>   
<lg type="poem">  
<l>``Oh, that a wind would take me there! that a bird would set me down</l>  
<l>Where the golden streets shine red at sunset in my father's town!</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>``For only in dreams I see the faces of the women there,</l>  
<l>And fain would I hear them singing once, braiding their ropes of hair.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>``Oh, I am thirsty, and long to drink of the river of Life, and I</l>  
<l>Am fain to find my own country, where no man shall die.''</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Out of the light of the throne the king looked down: as in the spring</l>  
<l>The green leaves burst from their dusky buds, so was hope in the eyes of the king.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>``Lo,'' he said, ``I will make thee great; I will make thee mighty in sway</l>  
<l>Even as I; but the name of thy country speak, and the place and the way.''</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>``Oh, the way to my country is ever north till you pass the mouth of hell,</l>  
<l>Past the limbo of dreams and the desolate land where shadows dwell.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>``And when you have reached the fount of wonder, you ford the waters wan</l>  
<l>To the land of elves and the land of fairies, enchanted Masinderan.''</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>The singer ceased; and the lyre in his hand snapped, as a cord, in twain;</l>  
<l>And neither lyre nor singer was seen in the kingdom of Persia again.</l>  
</lg>  
   <pb/>   
<lg type="poem">  
<l>And all the nobles gazed astounded; no man spoke a word</l>  
<l>Till the old king said: ``Call out my armies; bring me hither a sword!''</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>As a little torrent swollen by snows is turned to a terrible stream,</l>  
<l>So the gathering voices of all his countries cried to the king in his dream.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Crying, ``For thee, O our king, for thee we had freely and willingly died,</l>  
<l>Warriors, martyrs, what thou wilt; not that our lives betide</l>  
</lg>  
  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>``The worth of a thought to the king, but rather because thy rod</l>  
<l>Is over our heads as over thine Is the changeless will of God.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>``Rather for this we beseech thee, O master, for thine own sake refrain</l>  
<l>From the blasphemous madness of pride, from the fever of impious gain.''</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>``You seek my death,'' the king thundered; ``you cry, forbear to save</l>  
<l>The life of a king too old to frolic; let him sleep in the grave.</l>  
</lg>  
   <pb/>   
<lg type="poem">  
<l>``But I will live for all your treason; and, by my own right hand!</l>  
<l>I will set out this day with you to conquer Fairyland.''</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Then all the nations paled aghast, for the battle to begin</l>  
<l>Was a war with God, and a war with death, and they knew the thing was sin.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Sick at heart they gathered together, but none denounced the wrong,</l>  
<l>For the will of God was unseen, unsaid, and the will of the king was strong.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>So the air grew bright with spears, and the earth shook under the tread</l>  
<l>Of the mighty horses harnessed for battle; the standards flaunted red.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>And the wind was loud with the blare of trumpets, and every house was void</l>  
<l>Of the strength and stay of the house, and the peace of the land destroyed.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>And the growing corn was trodden under the weight of armed feet,</l>  
<l>And every woman in Persia cursed the sound of a song too sweet,</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Cursed the insensate longing for life in the heart of a sick old man;</l>  
<l>But the king of Persia with all his armies marched on Masinderan.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Many a day they marched in the sun till their silver armour was lead</l>  
<l>To sink their bodies into the grave, and many a man fell dead.</l>  
</lg>  
   <pb/>   
<lg type="poem">  
<l>And they passed the mouth of hell, and the shadowy country gray,</l>  
<l>Where the air is mist and the people mist and the rain more real than they.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>And they came to the fount of wonder, and forded the waters wan,</l>  
<l>And the king of Persia and all his armies marched on Masinderan.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>And they turned the rivers to blood, and the fields to a ravaged camp,</l>  
<l>And they neared the golden faery town, that burned in the dusk as a lamp.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>And they stood and shouted for joy to see it stand so nigh,</l>  
<l>Given into their hands for spoil; and their hearts beat proud and high.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>And the armies longed for the morrow, to conquer the shining town,</l>  
<l>For there was no death in the land, neither any to strike them down.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>The hosts were many in numbers, mighty, and skilled in the strife,</l>  
<l>And they lusted for gold and conquest as the old king lusted for life.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>And, gazing on the golden place, night took them unaware,</l>  
<l>And black and windy grew the skies, and black the eddying air</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>So long the night and black the night that fell upon their eyes,</l>  
<l>They quaked with fear, those mighty hosts; the sun would never rise.</l>  
</lg>  
   <pb/>   
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Darkness and deafening sounds confused the black, tempestuous air,</l>  
<l>And no man saw his neighbor's face, nor heard his neighbor's prayer.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>And wild with terror the raging armies fell on each other in fight,</l>  
<l>The ground was strewn with wounded men, mad in the horrible night</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Mad with eternal pain, with darkness and stabbing blows</l>  
<l>Rained on all sides from invisible hands till the ground was red as a rose.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>And, though he was longing for rest, none ventured to pause from the strife,</l>  
<l>Lest haply another wound be his to poison his hateful life</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>And the king entreated death; and for peace the armies prayed;</l>  
<l>But the gifts of God are everlasting, his word is not gainsaid;</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Gold and battle are given the hosts, their boon is turned to a ban,</l>  
<l>And the curse of the king is to reign forever in conquered Masinderan.</l>

KENTUCKY BELLE.  
</head>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>SUMMER of 'sixty-three, sir, and Conrad was gone away&mdash;</l>  
<l>Gone to the county-town, sir, to sell our first load of hay&mdash;</l>  
<l>We lived in the log-house yonder, poor as ever you've seen;</l>  
<l>R&ouml;schen there was a baby, and I was only nineteen.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Conrad, he took the oxen, but he left Kentucky Belle;</l>  
<l>How much we thought of Kentucky, I couldn't begin to tell&mdash;</l>  
<l>Came from the Blue-Grass country; my father gave her to me</l>  
<l>When I rode north with Conrad, away from Tennessee.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Conrad lived in Ohio&mdash;a German he is, you know&mdash;</l>  
<l>The house stood in broad corn-fields, stretching on, row after row;</l>  
<l>The old folks made me welcome; they were kind as kind could be</l>  
<l>But I kept longing, longing, for the hills of Tennessee.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>O, for a sight of water, the shadowed slope of a hill!</l>  
<l>Clouds that hang on the summit, a wind that is never still</l>  
<l>But the level land went stretching away to meet the sky&mdash;</l>  
<l>Never a rise, from north to south, to rest the weary eye!</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>From east to west, no river to shine out under the moon,</l>  
<l>Nothing to make a shadow in the yellow afternoon;</l>  
<l>Only the breathless sunshine, as I looked out, all forlorn;</l>  
<l>Only the ``rustle, rustle,'' as I walked among the corn.</l>  
</lg>  
   <pb/>   
<lg type="poem">  
<l>When I fell sick with pining, we didn't wait any more,</l>  
<l>But moved away from the corn-lands out to this river shore&mdash;</l>  
<l>The Tuscarawas it's called, sir&mdash;off there's a hill, you see&mdash;</l>  
<l>And now I've grown to like it next best to the Tennessee.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>I was at work that morning. Some one came riding like mad</l>  
<l>Over the bridge and up the road&mdash;Farmer Rouf's little lad;</l>  
<l>Bareback he rode; he had no hat; he hardly stopped to say;</l>  
<l>``Morgan's men are coming, Frau; they're galloping on this way;</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>``I'm sent to warn the neighbors. He isn't a mile behind;</l>  
<l>He sweeps up all the horses&mdash;every horse that he can find;</l>  
<l>Morgan, Morgan, the raider, and Morgan's terrible men,</l>  
<l>With bowie-knives and pistols, are galloping up the glen.''</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>The lad rode down the valley, and I stood still at the door;</l>  
<l>The baby laughed and prattled, playing with spools on the floor;</l>  
<l>Kentuck was out in the pasture; Conrad, my man, was gone;</l>  
<l>Nearer, nearer, Morgan's men were galloping, galloping on!</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Sudden I picked up the baby, and ran to the pasture-bar;</l>  
<l>``Kentuck!'' I called; ``Kentucky!'' She knew me ever so far!</l>  
<l>I led her down the gully that turns off there to the right,</l>  
<l>And tied her to the bushes; her head was just out of sight.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>As I ran back to the log-house, at once there came a sound&mdash;</l>  
<l>The ring of hoofs, galloping hoofs, trembling over the ground&mdash;</l>  
<l>Coming into the turnpike out from the White Woman Glen&mdash;</l>  
<l>Morgan, Morgan the raider, and Morgan's terrible men.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>As near they drew and nearer, my heart beat fast in alarm!</l>  
<l>But still I stood in the doorway, with baby on my arm.</l>  
<l>They came; they passed; with spur and whip in haste they sped along&mdash;</l>  
<l>Morgan, Morgan the raider, and his band six hundred strong.</l>  
</lg>  
   <pb/>   
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Weary they looked and jaded, riding through night and through day;</l>  
<l>Pushing on east to the river, many long miles away,</l>  
 <l>To the border-strip where Virginia runs up into the West,</l>  
 <l>To ford the Upper Ohio before they could stop to rest.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
 <l>On like the wind they hurried, and Morgan rode in advance;</l>  
 <l>Bright were his eyes like live coals, as he gave me a sideways glance;</l>  
 <l>And I was just breathing freely, after my choking pain,</l>  
 <l>When the last one of the troopers suddenly drew his rein.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
 <l>Frightened I was to death, sir; I scarce dared look in his face,</l>  
 <l>As he asked for a drink of water, and glanced around the place:</l>  
 <l>I gave him a cup, and he smiled   &mdash;   'twas only a boy, you see;</l>  
 <l>Faint and worn; with dim blue eyes, and he'd sailed on the Tennessee.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
 <l>Only sixteen he was, sir   &mdash;   a fond mother's only son&mdash;</l>  
 <l>Off and away with Morgan before his life had begun!</l>  
 <l>The damp drops stood on his temples; drawn was the boyish mouth;</l>  
 <l>And I thought me of the mother waiting down in the South!</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
 <l>O, pluck was he to the backbone; and clear grit through and through;</l>  
 <l>Boasted and bragged like a trooper; but the big words wouldn't do;</l>  
 <l>The boy was dying sir, dying, as plain as plain could be,</l>  
 <l>Worn out by his ride with Morgan up from the Tennessee.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
 <l>But, when I told the laddie that I too was from the South,</l>  
 <l>Water came into his dim eyes, and quivers around his mouth;</l>  
   <pb/>   
 <l>``Do you know the Blue-Grass country?'' he wistfully began to say;</l>  
 <l>Then swayed like a willow sapling, and fainted dead away.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
 <l>I had him into the log-house, and worked and brought him to;</l>  
 <l>I fed him, and I coaxed him, as I thought his mother'd do;</l>  
 <l>And, when the lad got better, and the noise in his head was gone,</l>  
 <l>Morgan's men were miles away, galloping, galloping on.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
 <l>``O, I must go,'' he muttered; ``I must be up and away!</l>  
 <l>Morgan, Morgan is waiting for me! O, what will Morgan say?''</l>  
 <l>But I heard the sound of tramping, and kept him back from the door   &mdash;   </l>  
 <l>The ringing sound of horses' hoofs that I had heard before.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
 <l>And on, on came the soldiers   &mdash;   the Michigan cavalry   &mdash;   </l>  
 <l>And fast they rode, and back they looked, galloping rapidly;</l>  
 <l>They had followed hard on Morgan's track; they had followed day and night;</l>  
 <l>But of Morgan and Morgan's raiders they had never caught a sight.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
 <l>And rich Ohio sat startled through all these summer days;</l>  
 <l>For strange, wild men were galloping over her broad highways;</l>  
 <l>Now here, now there, now seen, now gone, now north, now east, now west,</l>  
 <l>Through river-valleys and corn-land farms, sweeping away her best.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
 <l>A bold ride and a long ride! But they were taken at last;</l>  
 <l>They had almost reached the river by galloping hard and fast;</l>  
 <l>But the boys in blue were upon them ere ever they gained the ford,</l>  
 <l>And Morgan, Morgan the raider, laid down his terrible sword.</l>  
</lg>  
   <pb/>   
<lg type="poem">  
 <l>Well, I kept the boy till evening   &mdash;   kept him against his will   &mdash;   </l>  
 <l>But he was too weak to follow, and sat there pale and still;</l>  
 <l>When it was cool and dusky   &mdash;   you'll wonder to hear me tell   &mdash;   </l>  
 <l>But I stole down to the gully, and brought up Kentucky Belle.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
 <l>I kissed the star on her forehead   &mdash;   my pretty, gentle lass   &mdash;   </l>  
 <l>But I knew that she'd be happy, back in the old Blue-Grass:</l>  
 <l>A suit of clothes of Conrad's, with all the money I had,</l>  
 <l>And Kentucky, pretty Kentucky, I gave to the worn-out lad.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
 <l>I guided him to the southward, as well as I knew how:</l>  
 <l>The boy rode off with many thanks, and many a backward bow;</l>  
 <l>And then the glow it faded, and my heart began to swell;</l>  
 <l>And down the glen away she went, my lost Kentucky Belle!</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
 <l>When Conrad came in the evening, the moon was shining high,</l>  
 <l>Baby and I were both crying   &mdash;   I couldn't tell him why   &mdash;   </l>  
 <l>But a battered suit of rebel gray was hanging on the wall,</l>  
 <l>And a thin old horse with drooping head stood in Kentucky's stall.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
 <l>Well, he was kind, and never once said a hard word to me,</l>  
 <l>He knew I couldn't help it   &mdash;   'twas all for the Tennessee;</l>  
 <l>But, after the war was over, just think what came to pass   &mdash;   </l>  
 <l>A letter, sir, and the two were safe back in the old Blue-Grass.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
 <l>The lad got across the border, riding Kentucky Belle;</l>  
 <l>And Kentuck she was thriving, and fat, and hearty, and well;</l>  
 <l>He cared for her, and kept her, nor touched her with whip or spur;</l>  
 <l>Ah! we've had many horses, but never a horse like her!</l>

WHY HE WAS WHIPPED.  
</head>  
<p>  
HE was seven years old, lived in Cheyenne, and his name  
was Tommy. Moreover he was going to school for the  
first time in his life. Out here little people are not  
allowed to attend school when they are five or six, for the Law  
says: ``Children under seven must not go to school.''  
</p><p>But now Tommy was seven and had been to school two  
weeks, and such delightful weeks! Every day mamma listened  
to long accounts of how ``me and Dick Ray played marbles,''  
and ``us fellers cracked the whip.'' There was another thing that  
he used to tell mamma about, something that in those first days  
he always spoke of in the most subdued tones, and that&mdash;I am  
sorry to record it of any school, much more a Cheyenne school&mdash;  
was the numerous whippings that were administered to various  
little boys and girls. There was something painfully fascinating  
about those whippings to restless, mischievous little Tommy who  
had never learned the art of sitting still. He knew his turn might  
come at any moment and one night he cried out in his sleep: ``Oh,  
dear, what will become of me if I get whipped!'' But as the  
days passed on and this possible retribution overtook him not,  
his fears gradually forsook him, and instead of speaking pitifully  
of ``those poor little children who were whipped,'' he mentioned  
them in a causal off-hand manner as, ``those cry-babies, you  
know?'' One afternoon mamma saw him sitting on the porch,  
slapping his little fat hand with a strap. ``Tommy, child, what  
in the world are you doing?'' she asked.  
</p><p>Into his pocket he thrust the strap, and the pink cheeks grew  
pinker still as their owner answered:</p>  
   <pb/>   
<p>``I&mdash;I&mdash;was just seeing&mdash;how hard I could hit my hand&mdash;  
without crying;'' and he disappeared around the side of the house  
before mamma could ask any more questions.  
</p><p>The next day Tommy's seatmate, Dicky Ray, was naughty  
in school, and Miss Linnet called him up, opened her desk, took  
out a little riding whip&mdash;it was a bright blue one&mdash;and then and  
there administered punishment. And because he cried, when  
recess came, Tommy said: ``Isn't Dick Ray just a reg'lar girl  
cry-baby?'' (He had learned that word from some of the big  
boys, but, mind you! he never dared to say it before his mother.)  
</p><p>Dick's face flushed with anger. ``Never you mind, Tommy  
Brown,'' said he, ``Just wait till you get whipped and we'll see  
a truly girl-cry-baby then, won't we, Daisy?''  
</p><p>And blue-eyed Daisy, who was the idol of their hearts,  
nodded her curly little head in the most emphatic manner, and  
said she ``wouldn't be one bit s'prised if he'd holler so loud that  
hey would hear him way down in Colorado.''  
</p><p>Tommy stood aghast! for, really and truly, he wasn't quite  
so stony-hearted a little mortal as he appeared to be; he had been  
secretly rather sorry for Dick, but&mdash;he wanted Daisy to think  
that he himself was big and manly, and he had the opinion that  
this was just the way to win her admiration. But all this time  
<hi rend="italic">he didn't know what Daisy did</hi>&mdash;that Dick's pockets  
were full of  
sugar-plums; tiptop ones too, for Daisy had tasted them, and  
knew that little packets of them would from time to time find  
their way into her chubby hand.  
</p><p>All the rest of the morning Tommy kept thinking, thinking,  
thinking. One thing was certain: the present situation was  
not to be endured one moment longer than was absolutely necessary.  
But what could he do? Should he fight Dicky? This  
plan was rejected at once, on high, moral grounds. Well, then,  
   <pb/>   
supposing some dark night he should see Daisy on the street, just  
grab her, hold on tight and say: ``Now, Daisy Rivers, I won't  
let you go till you promise you'll like me a great deal betterer  
than you do Dick Ray.'' There seemed something nice about  
this plan, very nice; the more Tommy thought of it, the better  
he liked it; only there were two objections to it. Firstly: Daisy  
never by any chance ventured out doors after dark. Secondly:  
Neither did Tom.  
</p><p>Both objections being insurmountable, this delightful  
scheme was reluctantly abandoned, and the thinking process  
went on harder than ever, till at last&mdash;oh, oh! if he only dared!  
What a triumph it would be! But then he couldn't&mdash;yes, he  
could too. Didn't she say that she ``wouldn't be one bit s'prised  
if he hollered so loud that they would hear him way down in  
Colorado?'' Colorado, indeed! He'd show her there was one  
boy in the school who wasn't a girl-cry-baby!  
</p><p>Yes, actually, foolish Tommy had decided to prove his manhood  
by being whipped, and that that interesting little event  
should take place that very afternoon!  
</p><p>What did he do? He whispered six times!  
</p><p>Had it been any other child, he would surely have been  
punished; but Miss Linnet knew both Tommy and his mamma  
quite well, and therefore she knew also, quite well, that only a  
few days ago the one horror of Tommy's life had been the  
thought that he might possibly be whipped. Then too, it was  
his first term at school, and hitherto he had been very good. So  
she decided to keep him after school and talk to him of the  
sinfulness of bad conduct in general, and of whispering in  
particular. This plan she faithfully carried out, and the little  
culprit's heart so melted within him that he climbed up on his  
teacher's lap, put his arms around her neck and kissed her, crying  
   <pb/>   
he would never be so naughty again. He was just going to tell  
her all about Daisy,  
when in walked a  
friend of Miss Linnet's,  
so he went home  
instead. The next  
morning he started  
for school with the  
firm determination  
to be a good child,  
and I really believe  
he would have been  
had not that provoking  
little witch of a  
Daisy marched past  
him in a very  
independent manner, her  
saucy nose away up  
in the air, and a  
scornful look in the  
pretty blue eyes. It  
was more than flesh  
and blood could  
stand. All Tom's  
good resolutions flew  
sky-high.  
</p><p>When twelve o'clock came Miss Linnet's list of delinquents  
begun in this wise:</p>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>WHISPER MARKS.</l>  
<l>Thomas Brown  .  .  .  .  . 15</l>  
<l>Melinda Jones .  .  .  .  . 11</l>  
</lg>  
   <pb/>   
<p>There was great excitement among the little people. How  
dared any one be so dreadfully bad! Tommy's heart sank, sank,  
sank, when Miss Linnet said: ``When school begins this afternoon  
I shall punish Tommy and Melinda.''  
</p><p>And she did! She called them both up on the platform,  
made them clasp hands and stand with their backs against the  
blackboard, then wrote just above their heads:  
</p>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Thomas Brown </l>  
<l>and </l>  
<l>Melinda Jones</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">      
<l>Partners in disgrace.   </l>  
<l>15 plus 11 = 26.</l>  
</lg>  
<p>Oh, how mortified and ashamed Tommy was! If only she  
had whipped him, or if it had been some other girl. But  
<hi rend="italic">Melinda Jones!!!</hi> At the end of ten minutes Miss  
Linnet let them  
take their seats; but Tommy's heart burned within him. <hi rend="italic">Daisy  
had laughed when he stood there holding Melinda's hand!</hi>  
There were deep crimson spots on Tommy's cheeks all that afternoon  
and a resolute, determined look in his bright brown eyes,  
but he was very still and quiet.  
</p><p>Later in the day the children were startled by a sudden  
commotion on the other side of the room. Daisy was writing on  
her slate and Melinda Jones, in passing to her seat, accidentally  
knocked it out of her hands; without a moment's hesitation,  
Daisy, by way of expressing her feelings, snatched her slate and  
promptly administered such a sounding ``whack!'' on Melinda's  
back and shoulders as brought a shriek of anguish from that  
poor, little unfortunate who began to think that if all the days of  
her life were to be like unto this day, existence would certainly  
prove a burden.  
</p><p>Just about two minutes later Miss Linnet was standing by  
her desk, a ruler in one hand and Daisy's open palm in the other,  
while Daisy herself, miserable little culprit, stood white and  
   <pb/>   
trembling before her. As she raised the ruler to give the first  
blow, Tommy sprang forward, placing himself at Daisy's side,  
put his open palm over hers, and with tears in his eyes, pleaded  
in this wise:  
</p><p>``Please, Miss Linnet, whip me instead! She is only just a  
little girl and I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> she'll cry, it will hurt her  
so! I'd rather  
  
  
it would be me every time than Daisy&mdash;truly I won't cry. Oh,  
please whip me!''  
</p><p>And Miss Linnet did whip him, while Daisy, filled with  
   <pb/>   
remorse, clung to him sobbing as if her heart would break. To  
be sure, somebody who ought to know, told me it was the lightest  
``feruling'' ever child received; but Daisy and Tommy both  
assured their mothers that it was the ``dreadfulest, cruelest, hardest  
whipping ever was.''  
</p><p>``And did my little man cry?'' asked mamma.  
</p><p>``No, indeed! I stood up big as I could, looked at Daisy and  
smiled, 'cause I was so glad it wasn't her.''  
</p><p>Then that proud and happy mamma took him in her arms  
and kissed him; and right in the midst of the kissing in walked  
Daisy.  
</p><p>``Would Tommy please come and take supper with her?''  
</p><p>Of course he would, and they walked off hand in hand.  
When they passed Dicky's house Tommy suggested. ``S'posing  
they forgive Dick and let him go 'long too.'' And Daisy agreeing,  
they called that young gentleman out and magnanimously  
informed him that he was forgiven and might come and have  
supper with them.  
</p><p>What in the world they had to forgive, nobody knows; but  
then, so long as forgiveness proved such an eminently satisfactory  
arrangement, all round&mdash;why, nobody need care.  
</p><p>The children waited outside the gate while Dick coaxed his  
mother to let him go, and standing there, hand in hand, Daisy  
plucked up heart of grace and with very rosy cheeks and an air  
about her of general penitence, said something very sweet in a  
very small voice:  
</p><p>``I'm sorry you were whipped, and oh, Tommy, I wish I  
hadn't said you'd holler!''

<lg type="poem">  
 <l>You know how our brave men, white and black,</l>

<lg type="poem">  
 <l>Onward they moved through the living hell</l>  
 <l>Where the enemy's bullets like raindrops fell,</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
 <l>Down through the brush, and onward still</l>  
 <l>Till they came to the foot of San Juan hill   &mdash;   </l>

<lg type="poem">  
 <l>Then up they went, with never a fear,</l>  
 <l>And the heights were won with a mad, wild cheer!</l>

THE SOLDIER'S REPRIEVE.  
</head>  
<p>  
I THOUGHT, Mr. Allen, when I gave my Bennie to his  
country, that not a father in all this broad land made so  
precious a gift&mdash;no, not one. The dear boy only slept  
a minute, just one little minute at his post; I know that  
was all, for Bennie never dozed over a duty. How prompt and  
reliable he was! I know he only fell asleep one little second&mdash;he  
was so young and not strong, that boy of mine. Why, he was as  
tall as I, and only eighteen! And now they shoot him because  
he was found asleep when doing sentinel duty. ``Twenty-four  
hours,' the telegram said, only twenty-fours hours. Where is  
Bennie now?''  
</p><p>``We will hope with his heavenly Father,'' said Mr. Allen  
soothingly.  
</p><p>``Yes, yes; let us hope; God is very merciful! `I should  
be ashamed, father,' Bennie said, `when I am a man to think I  
never used this great right arm'&mdash;and he held it out proudly  
before me&mdash;`for my country when it needed it. Palsy it, rather  
than keep it at the plow.' `Go, then, my boy, and God keep you!'  
I said. God has kept him, I think, Mr. Allen!'' And the farmer  
repeated these last words slowly, as if in spite of his reason his  
heart doubted them.  
</p><p>``Like the apple of the eye, Mr. Owen; doubt it not.''  
</p><p>Blossom sat near them listening with blanched cheek. She  
had not shed a tear. Her anxiety had been so concealed that no  
one had noticed it. She had occupied herself mechanically in  
the household cares. Now, she answered a gentle tap at the  
door, opening it to receive from a neighbor's hand a letter. ``It  
is from him,'' was all she said.</p>  
   <pb/>   
<p>It was like a message from the dead! Mr. Owen took the  
letter, but could not break the envelope on account of his trembling  
fingers, and held it toward Mr. Allen, with the helplessness  
of a child. The minister opened it and read as follows:  
</p><p>``Dear Father:&mdash;When this reaches you I shall be in  
eternity. At first it seemed awful to me, but I have thought so much  
about it that now it has no terror. They say they will not bind  
me, nor blind me, but that I may meet death like a man. I  
thought, father, that it might have been on the battle field, for  
my country, and that when I fell, it would be fighting gloriously;  
but to be shot down like a dog for nearly betraying it&mdash;to die  
for neglect of duty! O, father! I wonder the very thought  
does not kill me! But I shall not disgrace you; I am going to  
write you all about it, and when I am gone you may tell my  
comrades. I cannot, now.  
</p><p>``You know I promised Jemmie Carr's mother I would  
look after her boy; and when he fell sick I did all I could for  
him. He was not strong when he was ordered back into the  
ranks, and the day before that night, I carried all his luggage  
besides my own on our march. Towards night we went in on  
double quick, and though the luggage began to feel very heavy,  
everybody else was tired, too; and as for Jemmie, if I had not  
lent him an arm now and then he would have dropped by the  
way. I was all tired out when we came into camp, and then it was  
Jemmie's turn to be sentry. I would take his place; but I was too  
tired, father. I could not have kept awake if a gun had been  
pointed at my head; but I did not know it until&mdash;well, until it  
was too late.''  
</p><p>``God be thanked'' interrupted Mr. Owen, reverently, ``I  
knew Bennie was not the boy to sleep carelessly at his post.''  
</p><p>``They tell me to-day that I have a short reprieve, `time to  
write to you,' the good Colonel says. Forgive him, Father, he  
   <pb/>   
only does his duty; he would gladly save me if he could; and  
do not lay my death against Jemmie. The poor boy is heart-broken, and does nothing but beg and entreat them to let him die  
in my place.  
</p><p>``I can't bear to think of mother and Blossom. Comfort  
them, Father! Tell them I die as a brave boy should, and that,  
when the war is over, they will not be ashamed of me, as they  
must be now. God help me! It is very hard to bear! Good-bye,  
father, God seems near and dear to me; not at all as if he wished  
me to perish forever, but as if he felt sorry for his poor sinful,  
broken-hearted child, and would take me to be with him and my  
Savior in a better life.''  
</p><p>A deep sigh burst from Mr. Owen's heart. ``Amen,'' he  
said, solemnly, ``amen.''  
</p><p>``To-night, in the early twilight, I shall see the cows all  
coming home from the pasture, and precious little Blossom  
standing on the back stoop, waiting for me! But I shall never,  
never come! God bless you all! Forgive your poor Bennie!''  
</p><p>Late that night the door of the ``back stoop'' opened softly  
and a little figure glided out and down the footpath that led  
to the road by the mill. She seemed rather flying than walking,  
turning her head neither to the right nor left, looking only now  
and then to heaven, and folding her hands is if in prayer. Two  
hours later the same young girl stood at the mill depot, watching  
the coming of the night train; and the conductor, as he reached  
down to lift her into the car, wondered at the tear-stained face  
that was upturned toward the dim lantern he held in his hand.  
A few questions and ready answers told him all; and no father  
could have cared more tenderly for his only child than he for  
our little Blossom. She was on her way to Washington to ask  
President Lincoln for her brother's life. She had stolen away,  
leaving only a note to tell them where and why she had gone.  
   <pb/>   
She had brought Bennie's letter with her; no good, kind heart  
like the President's could refuse to be melted by it. The next  
morning they reached New York, and the conductor hurried her  
on to Washington. Every minute, now, might be the means of  
saving her brother's life. And so, in an incredibly short time,  
Blossom reached the Capitol and hastened to the White House.  
</p><p>The president had just seated himself to his morning task  
of overlooking and signing important papers, when without one  
word of announcement the door softly opened, and Blossom, with  
down-cast eyes and folded hands, stood before him.  
</p><p>``Well, my child,'' he said in his pleasant, cheerful tones,  
``what do you want so bright and early this morning?''  
</p><p>``Bennie's life, sir,'' faltered Blossom.  
</p><p>``Who is Bennie?''  
</p><p>``My brother, sir. They are going to shoot him for sleeping  
at his post.''  
</p><p>``O, yes,'' and Mr. Lincoln ran his eye over the papers  
before him. ``I remember. It was a fatal sleep. You see, my  
child, it was a time of special danger. Thousands of lives might  
have been lost by his culpable negligence.''  
</p><p>``So my father said,'' replied Blossom, gravely. ``But poor  
Bennie was so tired, sir, and Jemmie so weak. He did the work  
of two, sir, and it was Jemmie's night, not his; but Jemmie was  
too tired, and Bennie never thought about himself that he was  
tired too.''  
</p><p>``What is this you say, child? Come here, I do not  
understand,'' and the kind man caught eagerly as ever at what seemed  
to be a justification of the offense.  
</p><p>Blossom went to him; he put his hand tenderly on her  
shoulder and turned up the pale face toward his. How tall he  
seemed! And he was the President of the United States, too!  
A dim thought of this kind passed for a minute through Blos-   <pb/>   
som's mind, but she told her simple, straightforward story and  
handed Mr. Lincoln Bennie's letter to read.  
</p><p>He read it carefully; then taking up his pen, wrote a few  
hasty lines, and rang his bell.  
</p><p>Blossom heard this order: ``Send this dispatch at once!''  
</p><p>The President then turned to the girl and said: ``Go home,  
my child, and tell that father of yours, who could approve his  
country's sentence even when it took the life of a child like that,  
that Abraham Lincoln thinks the life far too precious to be lost.  
Go back, or&mdash;wait until tomorrow. Bennie will need a change  
after he has so bravely faced death; he shall go with you.''  
</p><p>``God bless you, sir!'' said Blossom; and who shall doubt  
that God heard and registered the request?  
</p><p>Two days after this interview, the young soldier came to the  
White House with his little sister. He was called into the  
President's private room and a strap fastened upon his shoulder.  
Mr. Lincoln then said: ``The soldier that could carry a sick  
comrade's baggage and die for the act so uncomplainingly  
deserves well of his country.'' Then Bennie and Blossom took their  
way to their Green Mountain home. A crowd gathered at the  
mill depot to welcome them back; and as Farmer Owen's hand  
grasped that of the boy, tears flowed down his cheeks, and he was  
heard to say fervently:  
</p><p>``The Lord be praised!''

THE STORY OF THE EMPTY SLEEVE.  
</head>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>HERE, sit ye down alongside of me; I'm getting old and gray;</l>  
<l>But something in the paper, boy, has riled my blood today.</l>  
<l>To steal a purse is mean enough, the most of men agree;</l>  
<l>But stealing reputation seems a meaner thing to me.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>A letter in the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi> says some generals allow</l>  
<l>That there wa'n't no fight where Lookout rears aloft its shaggy brow;</l>  
<l>But this coat sleeve swinging empty here beside me, boy, to-day,</l>  
<l>Tells a mighty different story in a mighty different way.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>When sunbeams flashed o'er Mission Ridge that bright November morn,</l>  
<l>The misty cap on Lookout's crest gave token of a storm;</l>  
<l>For grim King Death had draped the mount in grayish, smoky shrouds&mdash;</l>  
<l>Its craggy peaks were lost to sight above the fleecy clouds.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Just at the mountain's rocky base we formed in serried lines,</l>  
<l>While lightning with its jagged edge played on us from the pines;</l>  
<l>The mission ours to storm the pits 'neath Lookout's crest that lay;</l>  
<l>We stormed the very ``gates of hell'' with ``Fighting Joe'' that day.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>The mountain seemed to vomit flames; the boom of heavy guns</l>  
<l>Played to Dixie's music, while a treble played the drums:</l>  
   <pb/>   
<l>The eagles waking from their sleep, looked down upon the stars</l>  
<l>Slow climbing up the mountain side, with morning's broken bars.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>We kept our eyes upon the flag that upward led the way</l>  
<l>Until we lost it in the smoke on Lookout side that day;</l>  
<l>And then like demons loosed from hell we clambered up the crag,</l>  
<l>``Excelsior,'' our motto, and our mission, ``Save the flag.''</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>In answer to the rebel yell we gave a ringing cheer;</l>  
<l>We left the rifle-pits behind, the crest loomed upward near;</l>  
<l>A light wind playing 'long the peaks just lifted death's gray shroud;</l>  
<l>We caught the gleam of silver stars just breaking through the cloud.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>A shattered arm hung at my side that day on Lookout's crag,</l>  
<l>And yet I'd give the other now to save the dear old flag.</l>  
<l>The regimental roll when called on Lookout's crest that night</l>  
<l>Was more than doubled by the roll Death called in realms of light.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Just as the sun sank slowly down behind the mountain's crest,</l>  
<l>When mountain peaks gave back the fire that flamed along the west,</l>  
<l>Swift riding down along the ridge upon a charger white,</l>  
<l>Came ``Fighting Joe,'' the hero now of Lookout's famous fight.</l>  
<l>He swung his cap as tears of joy slow trickled down his cheek,</l>  
<l>And as our cheering died away, the general tried to speak.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>He said, ``Boys, I'll court-martial you, yes, every man that's here;</l>  
<l>I said to take the rifle pits,'' we stopped him with a cheer,</l>  
<l>``I said to take the rifle pits upon the mountain's edge,</l>  
<l>And I'll court-martial you because&mdash;because you took the ridge''</l>  
</lg>  
   <pb/>   
<lg type="poem">  
<l>Then such a laugh as swept the ridge where late King Death had strode!</l>  
<l>And such a cheer as rent the skies, as down our lines he rode!</l>  
<l>I'm getting old and feeble, I've not long to live, I know,</l>  
<l>But there <hi rend="italic">was a fight at Lookout</hi>. I was there with</l>  
<l>``Fighting Joe.''</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>So these generals in the <hi rend="italic">Herald</hi>, they may reckon and allow</l>  
<l>That there warn't no fight at Lookout on the mountain's shaggy brow,</l>  
<l>But this empty coat-sleeve swinging here beside me, boy, to-day</l>  
<l>Tells a mighty different tale in a mighty different way.</l>

<head>FACING THE WORLD.  
</head>  
<p>  
GLAD I am, mother, the holidays are over. It's quite  
different going back to school again when one goes to  
be captain&mdash;as I'm sure to be. Isn't it jolly?''  
</p><p>Mrs. Boyd's face as she smiled back at Donald  
was not exactly ``jolly.'' Still, she did smile; and then there  
came out the strong likeness often seen between mother and son,  
even when, as in this case, the features were very dissimilar.  
Mrs. Boyd was a pretty, delicate little English woman: and  
Donald took after his father, a big, brawny Scotsman, certainly  
not pretty, and not always sweet. Poor man! he had of late  
years had only too much to make him sour.  
</p><p>Though she tried to smile and succeeded, the tears were in  
Mrs. Boyd's eyes, and her mouth was quivering. But she set it  
tightly together, and then she looked more than ever like her  
son, or rather, her son looked like her.  
</p><p>He was too eager in his delight to notice her much. ``It is  
jolly, isn't it, mother? I never thought I'd get to the top of the  
school at all, for I'm not near so clever as some of the fellows.  
But now I've got my place; and I like it, and I mean to keep it;  
you'll be pleased at that, mother?''  
</p><p>``I should have been if&mdash;if&mdash;'' Mrs. Boyd tried to get the  
words out and failed, closed her eyes as tight as her mouth for a  
minute, then opened them and looked her boy in the face gravely  
and sadly.  
</p><p>``It goes to my heart to tell you&mdash;I have been waiting to say  
it all morning, but, Donald, my dear, you will never go back to  
school at all.''</p>  
   <pb/>   
<p>``Not go back; when I'm captain! why, you and father both  
said that if I got to be that, I should not stop till I was seventeen&mdash;  
and now I'm only fifteen and a half. O, mother, you don't mean  
it! Father couldn't break his word! I may go back!''  
</p><p>Mrs. Boyd shook her head sadly, and then explained as  
briefly and calmly as she could the heavy blow which had fallen  
upon the father, and, indeed, upon the whole family. Mr. Boyd  
had long been troubled with his eyes, about as serious a trouble  
as could have befallen a man in his profession&mdash;an accountant&mdash;  
as they call it in Scotland. Lately he had made some serious  
blunders in his arithmetic, and his eyesight was so weak that his  
wife persuaded him to consult a first-rate Edinburgh oculist,  
whose opinion, given only yesterday, after many days of anxious  
suspense, was that in a few months he would become incurably  
blind.  
</p><p>``Blind, poor father blind!'' Donald put his hand before  
his own eyes. He was too big a boy to cry, or at any rate, to be  
seen crying, but it was with a choking voice that he spoke next:  
``I'll be his eyes; I'm old enough.''  
</p><p>``Yes; in many ways you are, my son,'' said Mrs. Boyd, who  
had had a day and a night to face her sorrow, and knew she must  
do so calmly. ``But you are not old enough to manage the business;  
your father will require to take a partner immediately,  
which will reduce our income one-half. Therefore we cannot  
possibly afford to send you to school again. The little ones must  
go, they are not nearly educated yet, but you are. You will have  
to face the world and earn your own living, as soon as ever you  
can. My poor boy!''  
</p><p>``Don't call me poor, mother. I've got you and father and  
the rest. And, as you say, I've had a good education so far.  
And I'm fifteen and a half, no, fifteen and three-quarters&mdash;  
almost a man. I'm not afraid.''</p>  
   <pb/>   
<p>``Nor I,'' said his mother, who had waited a full minute  
before Donald could find voice to say all this, and it was at last  
stammered out awkwardly and at random. ``No; I am not afraid  
because my boy has to earn his bread; I had earned mine for  
years as a governess when father married me. I began work  
before I was sixteen. My son will have to do the same, that is  
all.''  
</p><p>That day the mother and son spoke no more together. It  
was as much as they could do to bear their trouble, without talking  
about it, and besides, Donald was not a boy to ``make a fuss''  
over things. He could meet sorrow when it came, that is, the  
little of it he had ever known, but he disliked speaking of it, and  
perhaps he was right.  
</p><p>So he just ``made himself scarce'' till bedtime, and never  
said a word to anybody until his mother came into the boys'  
room to bid them good-night. There were three of them, but  
all were asleep except Donald. As his mother bent down to kiss  
him, he put both arms round her neck.  
</p><p>``Mother, I'm going to begin to-morrow.''  
</p><p>``Begin what, my son?''  
</p><p>``Facing the world, as you said I must. I can't go to school  
again, so I mean to try and earn my own living.''  
</p><p>``How?''  
</p><p>``I don't quite know, but I'll try. There are several things  
I could be, a clerk&mdash;or even a message-boy. I shouldn't like it,  
but I'd do anything rather than do nothing.''  
</p><p>Mrs. Boyd sat down on the side of the bed. If she felt  
inclined to cry she had too much sense to show it. She only took  
firm hold of her boy's hand, and waited for him to speak on.  
</p><p>``I've been thinking, mother, I was to have a new suit at  
Christmas; will you give it now? And let it be a coat, not a  
jacket. I'm tall enough&mdash;five feet seven last month, and growing  
   <pb/>   
still; I should look almost a man. Then I would go round to  
every office in Edinburgh and ask if they wanted a clerk. I  
wouldn't mind taking anything to begin with. And I can write  
a decent hand, and I'm not bad at figures; as for my Latin and  
Greek&mdash;''  
</p><p>Here Donald gulped down a sigh, for he was a capital  
classic, and it had been suggested that he should go to Glasgow  
University and try for ``the Snell'' which has sent so many clever  
young Scotsmen to Balliol College, Oxford, and thence on to  
fame and prosperity. But alas! no college career was now  
possible to Donald Boyd. The best he could hope for was to earn  
a few shillings a week as a common clerk. He knew this, and  
so did his mother. But they never complained. It was no fault  
of theirs, nor of anybody's. It was just as they devoutly called it,  
``The will of God.''  
</p><p>``Your Latin and Greek may come in some day, my boy,''  
said Mrs. Boyd cheerfully. ``Good work is never lost. In the  
meantime, your plan is a good one, and you shall have your new  
clothes at once. Then, do as you think best.''  
</p><p>``All right; good-night, mother,'' said Donald, and in five  
minutes more was fast asleep.  
</p><p>But, though he was much given to sleeping of nights&mdash;  
indeed, he never remembered lying awake for a single hour in his  
life-during daytime there never was a more ``wide awake'' boy  
than Donald Boyd. He kept his eyes open to everything, and  
never let the ``golden minute'' slip by him. He never idled  
about-play he didn't consider idling (nor do I). And I am  
bound to confess that every day until the new clothes came home  
was scrupulously spent in cricket, football, and all the other  
amusements which he was as good at as he was at his lessons. He  
wanted ``to make the best of his holidays,'' he said, knowing well  
   <pb/>   
that for him holiday time as well as school time was now done,  
and the work of the world had begun in earnest.  
</p><p>The clothes came home on Saturday night, and he went to  
church in them on Sunday, to his little sister's great admiration.  
Still greater was their wonder when, on Monday morning, he  
appeared in the same suit, looking quite a man, as they unanimously  
agreed, and almost before breakfast was done, started off,  
not saying a word of where he was going.  
</p><p>He did not come back till the younger ones were all away  
to bed, so there was no one to question him, which was fortunate,  
for they might not have got very smooth answers. His mother  
saw this, and she also forbore. She was not surprised that the  
bright, brave face of the morning looked dull and tired, and that  
evidently Donald had no good news of the day to tell her.  
</p><p>``I think I'll go to bed,'' was all he said. ``Mother, will you  
give me a `piece' in my pocket to-morrow? One can walk better  
when one isn't so desperately hungry.''  
</p><p>``Yes, my boy.'' She kissed him, saw that he was warmed  
and fed&mdash;he had evidently been on his legs the whole day&mdash;then  
sent him off to his bed, where she soon heard him delightfully  
snoring, oblivious of all his cares.  
</p><p>The same thing went on day after day, for seven days.  
Sometimes he told his mother what had happened to him and  
where he had been, sometimes not; what was the good of telling?  
It was always the same story. Nobody wanted a boy or a man,  
for Donald, trusting to his inches and his coat, had applied for  
man's work also, but in vain. Mrs. Boyd was not astonished.  
She knew how hard it is to get one's foot into ever so small a  
corner in this busy world, where ten are always struggling for  
the place of one. Still, she also knew that it never does to give  
in; that one must leave no stone unturned if one wishes to get  
work at all. Also she believed firmly in an axiom of her youth  
   <pb/>   
&mdash;``Nothing is denied to well-directed labor.'' But it must be  
real hard ``labor,'' and it must also be ``well directed.'' So,  
though her heart ached sorely, as only a mother's can, she never  
betrayed it, but each morning sent her boy away with a cheerful  
face, and each evening received him with one, which, if less  
cheerful, was not less sympathetic, but she never said a word.  
</p><p>At the week's end, in fact, on Sunday morning, as they were  
walking to church, Donald said to her: ``Mother, my new  
clothes haven't been of the slightest good. I've been all over  
Edinburgh, to every place I could think of&mdash;writers' offices,  
merchants' offices, wharves, railway-stations&mdash;but it's no use. Everybody  
wants to know where I've been before, and I've been nowhere  
except to school. I said I was willing to learn, but nobody  
will teach me; they say they can't afford it. It is like keeping a  
dog, and barking yourself. Which is only too true,'' added Donald,  
with a heavy sigh.  
</p><p>``May be,'' said Mrs. Boyd. Yet as she looked up at her son  
&mdash;she really did look up at him, he was so tall&mdash;she felt that if  
his honest, intelligent face and manly bearing did not win something  
at last, what was the world coming to? ``My boy,'' she  
said, ``things are very hard for you, but not harder than for others.  
I remember once, when I was only a few years older than you,  
finding myself with only half a crown in my pocket. To be sure  
it was a whole half-crown, for I had paid every half-penny I  
owed that morning, but I had no idea where the next half-crown  
would come from. However, it did come. I earned two pounds  
ten, the very day after that day.''  
</p><p>``Did you really, mother?'' said Donald, his eyes brightening.  
``Then I'll go on. I'll not 'gang awa back to my mither,'  
as that old gentleman advised me, who objected to bark himself;  
a queer, crabbed old fellow he was too, but he was the only one  
who asked my name and address. The rest of them&mdash;well,  
   <pb/>   
mother, I've stood a good deal these seven days,'' Donald added,  
gulping down something between a ``fuff'' of wrath and a sob.  
</p><p>``I am sure you have, my boy.''  
</p><p>``But I'll hold on; only you'll have to get my boots mended,  
and meantime, I should like to try a new dodge. My bicycle, it  
lies in the washing-house; you remember I broke it and you  
didn't wish it mended, lest I should break something worse than  
a wheel, perhaps. It wasn't worth while risking my life for  
mere pleasure, but I want my bicycle now for use. If you let me  
have it mended, I can go up and down the country for fifty miles  
in search of work&mdash;to Falkirk, Linlithgow, or even Glasgow,  
and I'll cost you nothing for traveling expenses. Isn't that a  
bright idea, mother?''  
</p><p>She had not the heart to say no, or to suggest that a boy on  
a bicycle applying for work was a thing too novel to be eminently  
successful. But to get work was at once so essential and so hopeless,  
that she would not throw any cold water on Donald's eagerness  
and pluck. She hoped too, that, spite of the eccentricity  
of the notion, some shrewd, kind-hearted gentleman might have  
sense enough to see the honest purpose of the poor lad who had  
only himself to depend upon. For his father had now fallen into  
a state of depression which made all application to him for either  
advice or help worse than useless. And as both he and Mrs. Boyd  
had been solitary orphans when they were married, there were  
no near relatives of any kind to come to the rescue. Donald  
knew, and his mother knew too, that he must shift for himself,  
to sink or swim.  
</p><p>So, after two days' rest, which he much needed, the boy went  
off again ``on his own hook,'' and his bicycle, which was a degree  
better than his legs, he said, as it saves shoe-leather. Also, he  
was able to come home pretty regularly at the same hour, which  
was a great relief to his mother. But he came home nearly as  
   <pb/>   
tired as ever, and with a despondent look which deepened every  
day. Evidently it was just the same story; no work to be had;  
or if there was work, it was struggled for by a score of fellows,  
with age, character, and experience to back them, and Donald  
had none of the three. But he had one quality, the root of all  
success in the end, dogged perseverance.  
</p><p>There is a saying, that we British gain our victories, not  
because we are never beaten, but because we never will see that  
we are beaten, and so go on fighting till we win. ``Never say die,''  
was Donald's word to his mother night after night. But she  
knew that those who never <hi rend="italic">say</hi> die, sometimes <hi rend="italic">do</hi> die, quite quietly,  
and she watched with a sore heart her boy growing thinner  
and more worn, even though brown as a berry with constant  
exposure all day long to wind and weather, for it was now less  
autumn than winter.  
</p><p>After a fortnight, Mrs. Boyd made up her mind that this  
could not go on any longer, and said so. ``Very well,'' Donald  
answered, accepting her decision as he had been in the habit of  
doing all his life.&mdash;Mrs. Boyd's children knew very well that  
whatever her will was, it was sure to be a just and wise will,  
herself being the last person she ever thought of.&mdash;``Yes, I'll give  
in, if you think I ought, for it's only wearing out myself and my  
clothes to no good. Only let me have one day more and I'll go  
as far as ever I can, perhaps to Dunfermline, or even Glasgow.''  
</p><p>She would not forbid, and once more she started him off  
with a cheerful face in the twilight of the wet October morning,  
and sat all day long in the empty house&mdash;for the younger ones  
were now all going to school again&mdash;thinking sorrowfully of her  
eldest, whose merry school days were done forever.  
</p><p>In the dusk of the afternoon a card was brought up to her,  
with the message that an old gentleman was waiting below, wishing  
to see her.  
   <pb/>   
</p><p>A shudder ran through the poor mother, who, like many  
another mother, hated bicycles, and never had an easy mind when  
Donald was away on his. The stranger's first word was anything  
but reassuring.  
</p><p>``Beg pardon ma'am, but is your name Boyd, and have you  
a son called Donald, who went out on a bicycle this morning?''  
</p><p>``Yes, yes! Has anything happened? Tell me quick!''  
</p><p>``I'm not aware, ma'am, that anything has happened,'' said  
the old gentleman. ``I saw the lad at light this morning. He  
seemed to be managing his machine uncommonly well. I met  
him at the foot of a hill near Edinburgh Castle. He had got off  
and was walking; so he saw me, and took off his cap. I like  
respect, especially in a young fellow towards an old one.''  
</p><p>``Did he know you, for I have not that pleasure?'' said Mrs.  
Boyd, polite, though puzzled. For the old man did not look  
quite like a gentleman, and spoke with the strong accent of an  
uneducated person, yet he had a kindly expression, and seemed  
honest and well-meaning, though decidedly ``canny.''  
</p><p>``I cannot say he knew me, but he remembered me, which  
was civil of him. And then I minded the lad as the one that had  
come to me for work a week or two ago, and I took his name and  
address. That's your son's writing?'' he jumbled out and showed  
a scrap of paper. ``It's <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>, isn't it?  
</p><p>``And he really is in search of work? He hasn't run away  
from home, or been turned out by his father for misconduct, or  
anything of that sort? He isn't a scamp, or a ne'er-do-weel?''  
</p><p>``I hope he doesn't look like it,'' said Mrs. Boyd, proudly.  
</p><p>``No, ma'am; you're right, he doesn't. He carries his  
character in his face which, maybe, is better than in his pocket. It  
was that which made me ask his name and address, though I  
could do nothing for him.''  
</p><p>``Then you were the gentleman who told him you couldn't  
   <pb/>   
keep a dog and bark yourself?'' said Mrs. Boyd, amused, and  
just a shade hopeful.  
</p><p>``Precisely. Nor can I. It would have been cool  
impudence in a lad to come and ask to be taught his work first and  
then paid for it, if he hadn't been so very much in earnest that I  
was rather sorry for him. I'm inclined to believe, from the talk  
I had with him at the foot of the brae to-day, that he is a young  
dog that would bark with uncommon little teaching. Material,  
ma'am, is what we want. I don't care for its being raw material,  
if it's only of the right sort. I've made up my mind to try your  
boy.''  
</p><p>``Thank God!''  
</p><p>``What did you say, ma'am? But&mdash;I beg your pardon.''  
</p><p>For he saw that Mrs. Boyd had quite broken down. In  
truth, the strain had been so long and so great that this sudden  
relief was quite too much for her. She sobbed heartily.  
</p><p>``I ought to beg your pardon,'' she said at last, ``for being so  
foolish, but we have had hard times of late.''  
</p><p>And then, in a few simple words, she told Donald's whole  
story.  
</p><p>The old man listened to it in silence. Sometimes he nodded  
his head, or beat his chin on his stout stick as he sat; but he made  
no comment whatever, except a brief ``Thank you, ma'am.''  
</p><p>``Now to business,'' continued he, taking out his watch; ``for  
I'm due at dinner: and I always keep my appointments, even  
with myself. I hope your Donald is a punctual lad?''  
</p><p>``Yes. He promised to be back by dark, and I am sure he will  
be. Could you not wait?''  
</p><p>``No. I never wait for anybody; but keep nobody waiting  
for me. I'm Bethune &amp; Co., Leith Merchants&mdash;practically, old  
John Bethune, who began life as a message-boy, and has done  
pretty well, considering.''  
   <pb/>   
</p><p>He had, as Mrs. Boyd was well aware. Bethune &amp; Co. was  
a name so well known that she could hardly believe in her boy's  
good luck in getting into that house in any capacity whatever.  
</p><p>``So all is settled,'' said Mr. Bethune, rising. ``Let him come  
to me on Monday morning, and I'll see what he is fit for. He'll  
have to start at the very bottom&mdash;sweep the office, perhaps&mdash;I  
did it myself once&mdash;and I'll give him&mdash;let me see&mdash;ten shillings  
a week to begin with.''  
</p><p>`` `To begin with,' '' repeated Mrs. Boyd, gently but firmly;  
``but he will soon be worth more. I am sure of that.''  
</p><p>``Very well. When I see what stuff he is made of, he shall  
have a rise. But I never do things at haphazard; and it's easier  
going up than coming down. I'm not a benevolent man, Mrs.  
Boyd, and you need not think it. But I've fought the world  
pretty hard myself, and I like to help those that are fighting it.  
Good evening. Isn't that your son coming round the corner?  
Well, he's back exact to his time, at any rate. Tell him I hope  
he will be as punctual on Monday morning. Good evening,  
ma'am.''  
</p><p>Now, if this were an imaginary story, I might wind it up  
by a delightful <hi rend="italic">denoument</hi> of Mr. Bethune's turning out an old  
friend of the family, or developing into a new one, and taking  
such a fancy to Donald that he immediately gave him a clerkship  
with a large salary, and the promise of a partnership on coming  
of age, or this worthy gentleman should be an eccentric old  
bachelor who immediately adopted that wonderful boy and  
befriended the whole Boyd family.  
</p><p>But neither of these things, nor anything else remarkable,  
happened in the real story, which, as it is literally true, though  
told with certain necessary disguises, I prefer to keep to as closely  
as I can. Such astonishing bits of ``luck'' do not happen in real  
life, or happen so rarely that one inclines, at least, to believe very  
   <pb/>   
little in either good or ill fortune, as a matter of chance. There  
is always something at the back of it which furnishes a key to the  
whole. Practically, a man's lot is of his own making. He may  
fail, for a while undeservedly, or he may succeed undeservedly,  
but, in the long run, time brings its revenges and its rewards.  
</p><p>As it did to Donald Boyd. He has not been taken into the  
house of Bethune &amp; Co., as a partner; and it was long before he  
became even a clerk&mdash;at least with anything like a high salary.  
For Mr. Bethune, so far from being an old bachelor, had a large  
family to provide for, and was bringing up several of his sons to  
his own business, so there was little room for a stranger. But  
a young man who deserves to find room generally does find it,  
or make it. And though Donald started at the lowest rung of  
the ladder, he may climb to the top yet.  
</p><p>He had ``a fair field, and no favor.'' Indeed, he neither  
wished nor asked favor. He determined to stand on his own  
feet from the first. He had hard work and few holidays, made  
mistakes, found them out and corrected them, got sharp words  
and bore them, learnt his own weak points and&mdash;not so easily&mdash;  
his strong ones. Still he did learn them; for, unless you can trust  
yourself, be sure nobody else will trust you.  
</p><p>This was Donald's great point. <hi rend="italic">He was  
trusted</hi>. People  
soon found out that they might trust him; that he always told the  
truth, and never pretended to do more than he could do; but that  
which he could do, they might depend upon his doing, punctually,  
accurately, carefully, and never leaving off till it was done.  
Therefore, though others might be quicker, sharper, more ``up  
to things'' than he, there was no one so reliable, and it soon got  
to be a proverb in the office of Bethune &amp; Co.&mdash;and other offices,  
too&mdash;``If you wish a thing done, go to Boyd.''  
</p><p>I am bound to say this, for I am painting no imaginary  
portrait, but describing an individual who really exists, and who  
   <pb/>   
may be met any day walking about Edinburgh, though his name  
is not Donald Boyd, and there is no such firm as Bethune &amp; Co.  
But the house he does belong to values the young fellow so highly  
that there is little doubt he will rise in it, and rise in every way,  
probably to the very top of the tree, and tell his children and  
grandchildren the story which, in its main features, I have  
recorded here, of how he first began facing the world.

<head>BABOUSCKA.  
</head>  
<p>  
IF you were a Russian child you would not watch to see  
Santa Klaus come down the chimney; but you would  
stand by the windows to catch a peep at poor Babouscka  
as she hurries by.  
</p><p>Who is Babouscka? Is she Santa Klaus' wife?  
</p><p>No, indeed. She is only a poor little crooked wrinkled old  
woman, who comes at Christmas time into everybody's house,  
who peeps into every cradle, turns back every coverlid, drops a  
tear on the baby's white pillow, and goes away very, very sorrowful.  
</p><p>And not only at Christmas time, but through all the cold  
winter, and especially in March, when the wind blows loud, and  
whistles and howls and dies away like a sigh, the Russian children  
hear the rustling step of the Babouscka. She is always in  
a hurry. One hears her running fast along the crowded streets  
and over the quiet country fields. She seems to be out of breath  
and tired, yet she hurries on.  
</p><p>Whom is she trying to overtake?  
</p><p>She scarcely looks at the little children as they press their  
rosy faces against the window pane and whisper to each other,  
``Is the Babouscka looking for us?''  
</p><p>No, she will not stop; only on Christmas eve will she come  
up-stairs into the nursery and give each little one a present. You  
must not think she leaves handsome gifts such as Santa Klaus  
brings for you. She does not bring bicycles to the boys or  
French dolls to the girls. She does not come in a gay little  
sleigh drawn by reindeer, but hobbling along on foot, and she  
leans on a crutch. She has her old apron filled with candy and  
   <pb/>   
cheap toys, and the children all love her dearly. They watch to  
see her come, and when one hears a rustling, he cries, ``Lo! the  
Babouscka!'' then all others look, but one must turn one's head  
very quickly or she vanishes. I never saw her myself.  
</p><p>Best of all, she loves little babies, and often, when the tired  
mothers sleep, she bends over their cradles, puts her brown,  
wrinkled face close down to the pillow and looks very sharply.  
</p><p>What is she looking for?  
</p><p>Ah, that you can't guess unless you know her sad story.  
</p><p>Long, long ago, a great many yesterdays ago, the Babouscka,  
who was even then an old woman, was busy sweeping her little  
hut. She lived in the coldest corner of cold Russia, and she  
lived alone in a lonely place where four wide roads met.  
These roads were at this time white with snow, for it was winter  
time. In the summer, when the fields were full of flowers and  
the air full of sunshine and singing birds, Babouscka's home did  
not seem so very quiet; but in the winter, with only the snowflakes  
and the shy snow-birds and the loud wind for company,  
the little old woman felt very cheerless. But she was a busy  
old woman, and as it was already twilight, and her home but half  
swept, she felt in a great hurry to finish her work before  
bedtime. You must know the Babouscka was poor and could not  
afford to do her work by candle-light.  
</p><p>Presently, down the widest and the lonesomest of the white  
roads, there appeared a long train of people coming. They  
were walking slowly, and seemed to be asking each other questions  
as to which way they should take. As the procession came  
nearer, and finally stopped outside the little hut, Babouscka was  
frightened at the splendor. There were Three Kings, with  
crowns on their heads, and the jewels on the Kings' breastplates  
sparkled like sunlight. Their heavy fur cloaks were white with  
the falling snow-flakes, and the queer humpy camels on which  
   <pb/>   
they rode looked white as milk in the snow-storm. The harness  
on the camels was decorated with gold, and plates of silver  
adorned the saddles. The saddle-cloths were of the richest  
Eastern stuffs, and all the servants had the dark eyes and hair of  
an Eastern people.  
</p><p>The slaves carried heavy loads on their backs, and each of  
the Three Kings carried a present. One carried a beautiful  
transparent jar, and in the fading light Babouscka could see in  
it a golden liquid which she knew from its color must be myrrh.  
Another had in his hand a richly woven bag, and it seemed to  
be heavy, as indeed it was, for it was full of gold. The third  
had a stone vase in his hand, and from the rich perfume which  
filled the snowy air, one could guess the vase to have been  
filled with incense.  
</p><p>Babouscka was terribly frightened, so she hid herself in her  
hut, and let the servants knock a long time at her door before  
she dared open it and answer their questions as to the road they  
should take to a far-away town. You know she had never studied  
a geography lesson in her life, was old and stupid and scared.  
She knew the way across the fields to the nearest village, but she  
know nothing else of all the wide world full of cities. The  
servants scolded, but the Three Kings spoke kindly to her, and  
asked her to accompany them on their journey that she might  
show them the way as far as she knew it. They told her, in  
words so simple that she could not fail to understand, that they  
had seen a Star in the sky and were following it to a little town  
where a young Child lay. The snow was in the sky now, and  
the Star was lost out of sight.  
</p><p>``Who is the Child?'' asked the old woman.  
</p><p>``He is a King, and we go to worship him,'' they answered.  
``These presents of gold, frankincense and myrrh are for Him.  
   <pb/>   
When we find Him we will take the crowns off our heads and  
lay them at His feet. Come with us, Babouscka!''  
</p><p>What do you suppose? Shouldn't you have thought the  
poor little woman would have been glad to leave her desolate  
home on the plains to accompany these Kings on their journey?  
</p><p>But the foolish woman shook her head. No, the night was  
dark and cheerless, and her little home was warm and cosy.  
She looked up into the sky, and the Star was nowhere to be seen.  
Besides, she wanted to put her hut in order&mdash;perhaps she would  
be ready to go to-morrow. But the Three Kings could not wait;  
so when to-morrow's sun rose they were far ahead on their journey.  
It seemed like a dream to poor Babouscka, for even the  
tracks of the camels' feet were covered by the deep white snow.  
Everything was the same as usual; and to make sure that the  
night's visitors had not been a fancy, she found her old broom  
hanging on a peg behind the door, where she had put it when  
the servants knocked.  
</p><p>Now that the sun was shining, and she remembered the  
glitter of the gold and the smell of the sweet gums and myrrh,  
she wished she had gone with the travelers.  
</p><p>And she thought a great deal about the dear Baby the Three  
Kings had gone to worship. She had no children of her own&mdash;  
nobody loved her&mdash;ah, if she had only gone! The more she  
brooded on the thought, the more miserable she grew, till the  
very sight of her home became hateful to her.  
</p><p>It is a dreadful feeling to realize that one has lost a chance  
of happiness. There is a feeling called remorse that can gnaw  
like a sharp little tooth. Babouscka felt this little tooth cut into  
her heart every time she remembered the visit of the Three  
Kings.  
</p><p>After a while the thought of the Little Child became her  
first thought at waking and her last at night. One day she shut  
   <pb/>   
the door of her house forever, and set out on a long journey.  
She had no hope of overtaking the Three Kings, but she longed  
to find the Child, that she too might love and worship Him.  
She asked every one she met, and some people thought her crazy,  
but others gave her kind answers. Have you perhaps guessed  
that the young Child whom the Three Kings sought was our  
Lord himself?  
</p><p>People told Babouscka how He was born in a manger, and  
many other things which you children have learned long ago.  
These answers puzzled the old dame mightily. She had but  
one idea in her ignorant head. The Three Kings had gone to  
seek a Baby. She would, if not too late, seek Him too.  
</p><p>She forgot, I am sure, how many long years had gone by.  
She looked in vain for the Christ-child in His manger-cradle.  
She spent all her little savings in toys and candy so as to make  
friends with little children, that they might not run away when  
she came hobbling into their nurseries.  
</p><p>Now you know for whom she is sadly seeking when she  
pushes back the bed-curtains and bends down over each baby's  
pillow. Sometimes, when the old grandmother sits nodding  
by the fire, and the bigger children sleep in their beds, old  
Babouscka comes hobbling into the room, and whispers softly, ``Is  
the young Child here?''  
</p><p>Ah, no; she has come too late, too late. But the little  
children know her and love her. Two thousand years ago she lost  
the chance of finding Him. Crooked, wrinkled, old, sick and  
sorry, she yet lives on, looking into each baby's face&mdash;always  
disappointed, always seeking. Will she find Him at last?

THE LOST DIAMOND SNUFF BOX.  
</head>  
<p>  
THE grand old kingdom of England, in the course of the  
mossy centuries you can count over its head, has had its  
times of gloom and depression at dangers that looked  
near, and its times of shouting and rejoicing over  
dangers its brave men have driven away quite out of sight again.  
</p><p>One of the deepest seasons of gloom was when the French  
Emperor, Napoleon, had conquered one country after another,  
until there was scarcely anything but England left to attack; and  
one of the proudest times of rejoicing was when the ``Iron Duke''  
Wellington, and the bluff old Prussian, Blucher, met him at  
Waterloo, defeated his armies and drove him from the field.  
There were bonfires, and bell-ringings then, and from that day  
onward England loved and cherished every man who had fought  
at Waterloo&mdash;from the ``Duke'' himself down to the plainest  
private, every one was a hero and a veteran.  
</p><p>In one of the humblest houses of a proud nobleman's estate,  
a low, whitewashed cottage, one of these veterans lived not so  
very many years ago. He had fought by his flag in one of the  
most gallant regiments until the last hour of the battle, and then  
had fallen disabled from active service for the rest of his life.  
</p><p>That did not seem to be of so very great consequence though,  
just now; for peace reigned in the land, and with his wife and  
two beautiful daughters to love, his battles to think over, and his  
pension to provide the bread and coffee, the old soldier was as  
happy as the day was long. It made no difference that the bread  
and the coffee were both black, and the clothes of the veteran  
were coarse and seldom new.  
</p><p>``Ho, Peggy!'' he used to say to his wife, ``my cloak is as fine  
   <pb/>   
as the one the `Iron Duke' wore when they carried me past him  
just as the French were breaking; and as for the bread, only a  
veteran knows how the recollection of victory makes everything  
taste sweet!''  
</p><p>But it seemed as if the old soldier's life was going to prove  
like his share in that great day at Waterloo&mdash;success and victory  
till the end had nearly come, and then one shot after another  
striking him with troubles, he could never get over.  
</p><p>The first came in the midst of the beautiful summer days,  
when the bees droned through the delicious air, the rose-bush  
was in full bloom, and the old soldier sat in the cottage door  
reveling in it all. A slow, merciless fever rose up through the  
soft air&mdash;it did not venture near the high ground where the castle  
stood, but it crept noiselessly into the whitewashed cottage, one  
night, and the soldier's two daughters were stricken down. This  
was the beginning of terrible trouble to the veteran of Waterloo.  
Not that he minded watching, for he was used to standing sentry  
all night, and as for nursing, he had seen plenty in the  
hospital; but to see his daughters suffering&mdash;that was what he could  
not bear!  
</p><p>And worst of all, between medicines and necessaries for the  
sick, the three months' pension was quite used up, and when the  
old soldier's nursing had pulled through the fierceness of the  
fever, there was nothing but black bread left in the house&mdash;and  
black bread was almost the same as no bread at all to the dainty  
appetities the fever had left; and that was what he had to think  
of, and think of, as he sat in the cottage door.  
</p><p>``Bah!'' said the old soldier, with something more like a  
groan than was ever heard from him while his wounds were  
being dressed, ``I could face all the armies of Napoleon better  
than this!''  
</p><p>And he sat more and more in the cottage door, as if that  
   <pb/>   
could leave the trouble behind; but it stood staring before him,  
all the same, till it almost shut the rosebush and the bees out  
of sight. But one morning a tremendous surprise came to him  
like a flash out of the sky! He heard the sound of galloping  
troops, and he pricked up his ears, for that always made him  
think of a cavalry charge.  
</p><p>``Who goes there?'' he cried; but without answering his  
challenge the sound came nearer and nearer, and a lackey in full  
livery dashed up to the door, and presented him with a note  
sealed with the blood-red seal of the castle arms. It was an  
invitation to dine at the castle with a company of noblemen and  
officers of the army. His lordship, who had also fought at  
Waterloo, had just learned that a comrade was living on his  
estate, and made haste to do him honor, and secure a famous  
guest for his dinner party.  
</p><p>The old soldier rose up proudly, and gave the lackey a  
military salute.  
</p><p>``Tell his lordship,'' he said, ``that I shall report myself at  
headquarters, and present my thanks for the honor he has done  
me.''  
</p><p>The lackey galloped off, and the veteran pushed his chair  
over with his wooden leg, and clattered across the cottage floor.  
</p><p>``Ho, Peggy!'' he cried, ``did I not say that luck comes and  
trouble flies if you only face the enemy long enough? This is  
the beginning of good things, I tell you! A hero of Waterloo,  
and fit to dine with lords and generals, will certainly have other  
good fortune coming to him, till he can keep his wife and daughters  
like princesses. Just wait a bit and you shall see!'' and he  
turned hastily away, for his heart came up in his throat so that  
he could not speak.  
</p><p>All the rest of that day he sat in the door, brushing and darning  
and polishing his stained uniform. It had lain abandoned  
   <pb/>   
on the shelf for many a year, but before night every button was  
shining like gold, the scarlet cloth was almost fresh once more,  
and the old soldier, wrapped in his faithful cloak, was making  
his way joyfully across the heathery moors to the castle quite at  
the other side.  
</p><p>But when he had fairly reached it, and the servant had  
shown him into the drawing-room, his heart almost failed him  
for a moment. Such splendor he had never seen before&mdash;a  
thousandth part would have bought health and happiness for the dear  
ones he had left with only his brave goodbye and a fresh rose-bud  
to comfort them!  
</p><p>However, what with the beautiful ladies of the castle  
gathering round him to ask questions about the battle, and with a seat  
near his lordship's right hand at dinner, he soon plucked up  
again, and began to realize how delightful everything was. But  
that was the very thing that almost spoiled the whole again, for  
when he saw his plate covered with luxuries and delicacies more  
than he could possibly eat, the thought of the black bread he had  
left at the cottage brought the tears rushing to his eyes.  
</p><p>But, ``Tut!'' he said to himself in great dismay, ``what an  
ungrateful poltroon his lordship will think he has brought here!''  
and he managed to brush them off while no one was looking.  
</p><p>It was delicious, though, in spite of everything, and after  
a while the wine began to flow&mdash;that warmed his very heart&mdash;  
and then he heard his lordship calling to a servant to bring  
him something from his private desk, saying:  
</p><p>``Gentlemen, I am about to show you the proudest treasure  
I possess. This diamond snuff-box was presented to me by the  
stout old Bl&uuml;cher himself, in remembrance of service I was able  
to perform at Waterloo. Not that I was a whit worthier of it  
than the brave fellows under my command&mdash;understand that!''  
</p><p>How the diamonds glistened and gleamed as the box was  
   <pb/>   
passed from hand to hand! As if the thickest cluster of stars you  
ever saw, could shine out in the midst of a yellow sunset sky, and  
the colors of the rainbow could twinkle through them at the same  
time! It was superb, but then that was nothing compared to  
the glory of receiving it from Bl&uuml;cher!  
</p><p>Then there was more wine and story-telling, and at last  
some asked to look at the snuff-box again.  
</p><p>``Has any one the snuff-box at present?'' asked his lordship,  
rather anxiously, for as he turned to reach it no snuff-box was to  
be seen.  
</p><p>No one said ``yes,'' for everyone was sure he had passed it  
to his neighbor, and they searched up and down the table with  
consternation in their faces, for the snuff-box could not have  
disappeared without hands, but to say so was to touch the honor  
of gentlemen and soldiers.  
</p><p>At last one of the most famous officers rose from his seat:  
</p><p>``My lord, he said, ``a very unlucky accident must have  
occurred here. Some one of us must have slipped the box into  
his pocket unconsciously, mistaking it for his own. I will take  
the lead in searching mine, if the rest of the company will  
follow!''  
</p><p>``Agreed!'' said the rest, and each guest in turn went to the  
bottom of one pocket after another, but still no snuff-box, and  
the distress of the company increased. The old soldier's turn  
came last, and with it came the surprise. With burning cheeks  
and arms folded closely across his breast he stood up and  
confronted the company like a stag at bay.  
</p><p>``No!'' he exclaimed, ``no one shall search my pockets!  
Would you doubt the honor of a soldier?''  
</p><p>``But we have all done so,'' said the rest, ``and every one  
knows it is the merest accident at the most.'' But the old soldier  
only held his arms the tighter, while the color grew deeper in  
   <pb/>   
his face. In his perplexity his lordship thought of another  
expedient.  
</p><p>``We will try another way, gentlemen,'' he said, ``I will  
order a basket of bran to be brought, and propose that each one  
in turn shall thrust his hand into the bran. No one shall look  
on, and if we find the box at last, no one can guess whose hand  
placed it there.''  
</p><p>It was quickly done, and hand after hand was thrust in,  
until at last came the old soldier's turn once more. But he was  
nowhere to be seen.  
</p><p>Then, at last the indignation of the company broke forth.  
</p><p>``A soldier, and a hero of Waterloo, and willing to be a  
thief!'' and with their distress about the affair, and his lordship's  
grief at his loss, the evening was entirely spoiled.  
</p><p>Meantime the old soldier, with his faithful cloak wrapped  
closely round him once more, was fighting his way through the  
sharp winds and over the moors again. But a battle against  
something a thousand times sharper and colder was going on  
in his breast.  
</p><p>``A thief!'' he was saying over and over to himself, ``me, who  
fought close to the side of the `Iron Duke'! And yet, can I look  
one of them in the face and tell him he lies?''  
</p><p>The walk that had been gone over so merrily was a terrible  
one to retrace, and when the cottage was reached, instead of the  
pride and good luck the poor invalids had been watching for,  
a gloom deadlier than the fever followed him in. He sat in  
the doorway as he used, but sometimes he hung his head on his  
breast, and sometimes started up and walked proudly about,  
crying&mdash;  
</p><p>``Peggy! I say no one shall call me a thief! I am a soldier of  
the Iron Duke!''  
</p><p>But they did call him a thief, though, for a very strange  
   <pb/>   
thing, after his lordship had sorrowfully ordered the cottage and  
little garden spot to be searched no box was found, and the gloom  
and the mystery grew deeper together.  
</p><p>Good nursing could not balance against trouble like this;  
the beautiful daughters faded and died, the house was too  
gloomy to stay inside, and if he escaped to the door, he had to  
hear the passers say&mdash;  
</p><p>``There sits the soldier who stole the Bl&uuml;cher diamonds from  
his host!''  
</p><p>And as if this was not enough, one day the sound of hoofs  
was heard again, and a rider in uniform clattered up to the door  
saying:  
</p><p>``Comrade, I am sent to tell you that your pension is  
stopped! His Majesty cannot count a thief any longer a soldier  
of his!''  
</p><p>After this the old soldier hardly held up his head at all,  
and his hair, that had kept black as a coal all these years, turned  
white as the moors when the winter snows lay on them.  
</p><p>``Though that is all the same, Peggy,'' he used to say, ``for  
it is winter all the year round with me! If I could only die as  
the old year does! That would be the thing!''  
</p><p>But long and merciless as the winter is, spring does come at  
last, if we can but live and fight our way through the storms and  
cold.  
</p><p>One night a cry of fire roused all the country-side. All but  
the old soldier. He heard them say the castle was burning, but  
what was that to him? Nothing could burn away the remembrance  
that he had once been called a thief within its walls!  
But the next morning he heard a step&mdash;not a horse's hoof this  
time, but a strong man walking hastily towards him.  
</p><p>``Where is the veteran of Waterloo?'' asked his lordship's  
   <pb/>   
voice, and when the old soldier stepped forward, he threw his  
arms about his neck with tears and sobs.  
</p><p>``Comrade,'' he said, ``come up to the castle! The snuff-box  
is found, and I want you to stand in the very room where it was  
lost while I tell everyone what a great and sorrowful wrong a  
brave and honest soldier has suffered at my hands!''  
</p><p>It did not take many words to explain. In the first alarm  
of fire the butler had rushed to the plate-closet to save the silver.  
</p><p>``Those goblets from the high shelf! Quick!'' he said, to  
the footman who was helping him, and with the haste about the  
goblets something else came tumbling down.  
</p><p>``The lost diamond snuff-box!'' cried the butler. ``That  
stupid fellow I dismissed the day it disappeared, must have put  
it there and forgotten all about it!''  
</p><p>The fire was soon extinguished, but not a wink of sleep  
could his lordship get until he could make reparation for the  
pitiful mistake about the box; and once more the old soldier  
made his way across the moors, even the wooden leg stepping  
proudly as he went along, though now and then, as the old feeling  
came over him, his white head would droop for a moment  
again.  
</p><p>The servants stood aside respectfully as he entered the castle,  
and they and the other guests of that unlucky day gathered  
round him while his lordship told them how the box had been  
found and how he could not rest until forgiven by the brave hero  
he had so unjustly suspected of wrong.  
</p><p>``And now,'' said the company, ``will you not tell us one  
thing more? Why did you refuse to empty your pockets, as all  
the rest were willing to do?''  
</p><p>``Because,'' said the old soldier sorrowfully, ``because I <hi rend="italic">was</hi>  
a thief, and I could not bear that anyone should discover it!  
All whom I loved best in the world were lying sick at home,  
   <pb/>   
starving for want of the delicacies I could not provide, and I felt  
as if my heart would break to see my plate heaped with luxuries  
while they had not so much as a taste! I thought a mouthful  
of what I did not need might save them, and when no one was  
looking I slipped some choice bits from my plate between two  
pieces of bread and made way with them into my pocket. I  
could not let them be discovered for a soldier is too proud to  
beg, but oh, my lord, he can bear being called a thief all his  
life better than he can dine sumptuously while there is only black  
bread at home for the sick and weak whom he loves!''  
</p><p>Tears came streaming from the old soldier's listeners by  
this time, and each vied with the other in heaping honors and  
gifts in place of the disgrace suffered so long; but all that was  
powerless to make up for the past.  
</p><p>Two good lessons may be learned from the story: Never  
believe any one guilty who is not really proved to be so. Never  
let false shame keep you from confessing the truth, whether  
trifling or of importance.

AUNT POLLY SHEDD'S BRIGADE.  
</head>  
<p>  
SOMETHING about the Battle of Hampden?'' Grandma  
took off her spectacles and wiped them reflectively  
``It seems to me already I have told you everything  
worth telling; but there!'' in a sudden burst of recollection,  
``did I ever tell you about Aunt Polly Shedd's Brigade?  
That was quite an affair to those of us that belonged to it!''  
</p><p>``Oh, no! do tell us about it!'' called out the three childish  
voices in chorus; and grandma only waited to knit by the seam  
needle.  
</p><p>``I've told you all about it so many times that I don't need  
to describe again that dreadful morning when the British man-of-war came up the river and, dropping her anchor just opposite  
our little village of Hampden, sent troops ashore to take possession  
of the place in the King's name. So what I am going to  
tell you now is how, and where, we youngsters spent the three  
days that the British occupied our houses. I was about twelve  
years old at the time. I remember that it was just as we were  
getting up from the breakfast-table that one of our neighbors,  
Sol Grant, old General Grant's youngest son, rushed in without  
knocking, his face as white as a sheet, and his cap on hind-side  
before, and called out hurriedly:  
</p><p>`` `Mr. Swett, if you love your family, for God's sake find a  
place of safety for 'em! The British are coming ashore&mdash;three  
boat-loads of 'em, armed to the teeth&mdash;and they won't spare man,  
woman nor child!  
</p><p>``Mother's face grew very pale, but she stepped quietly  
around, with her baby on her arm, close to where father was  
standing, and laid one hand on his arm, while she said, in a firm,  
clear voice:  
   <pb/>   
</p><p>`` `<hi rend="italic">My</hi> place is with you, Benjamin, but we  
must think of   
some place of safety for the children. Where can they go?'  
</p><p>``Sol was just rushing out of the door as unceremoniously as  
he had rushed in, but he stopped when he heard her ask that,  
long enough to say:  
</p><p>`` `I forgot to tell you that Aunt Polly Shedd will take all  
the children put in her charge out to Old Gubtil's; that's so out  
of the way they won't be disturbed, 'specially as the old man's  
a tory himself.'  
</p><p>``Mother kissed us all round, with a smile on her face that  
couldn't quite hide the tears with which her dear eyes were  
filled, and as she hastily bundled us in whatever garment came  
to hand, she bade us be good children, and make Aunt Polly and  
the Gubtils as little trouble as possible. Then we followed  
father out-of-doors and into the school-house yard where a score  
or more of children were already gathered&mdash;still as mice for  
intense terror. Aunt Polly, in her big green calash, and a pillow-case of valuables under one arm, was bustling to and fro, speaking  
an encouraging or admonitory word, as the case might be,  
and wearing upon her pinchesl, freckled little face such a  
reassuring smile that I soon felt my own courage rise and, dashing  
back the tears that had filled my eyes a moment before, I busied  
myself in pinning little Sally's blanket more closely about her  
neck and setting the faded sunbonnet upon the tangled curls that  
had not yet had their customary morning's dressing.  
</p><p>`` `Come, children,' called out Aunt Polly cheerily, `you're  
all here now, and we'll start right off. I'll go ahead, an' all you  
little ones had best keep close to me; the bigger ones can come  
along behind.'  
</p><p>``Obedient to her order we started, following her steps  
across the road by the beeches, and up by the grocery store where  
a crowd of excited men were congregated, talking loudly with  
   <pb/>   
wild gesticulations, while farther down, toward the shore, we  
could catch glimpses, through the thick morning fog, of the blue  
uniforms of our militia company that had been summoned in  
hot haste to defend the town. As we filed past, I remember I  
heard one of the men on the grocery steps speak:  
</p><p>`` `I tell you they won't leave one stone on another if they  
get possession of the town, and they'll impress all the able-bodied  
men and all the big boys into the King's service besides.'  
</p><p>``A cold shiver ran over me and I caught so hard at little  
Sally's hand that the child cried out with pain, and Aunt Polly  
said anxiously:  
</p><p>`` `Hurry up, dears! 'tain't much more'n a mile out to Gubtil's,  
and you'll have a good nice chance to rest after we get  
there.'  
</p><p>``Just then the martial music of a fife and drum announced  
the landing of the enemy's troops, and I tell you it quickened  
the lagging footsteps of even the youngest child into a run, and  
we just flew, helter-skelter, over the rough, little-used road that  
led to the Gubtil farm. Aunt Polly's gentle tones were unheeded.  
All she could do was to carry the weakest in her arms over all  
the worst places, with a word of cheer, now and then, to some  
child who was not too much frightened to heed it.  
</p><p>``What a haven of safety the low, unpainted old farm-house looked to us, as we rushed, pell-mell, into the dooryard,  
never noticing, in our own relief, the ungracious scowl with  
which the master and mistress of the house regarded our advent.  
</p><p>``Aunt Polly soon explained matters, taking care to assure  
the inhospitable pair that our parents would amply recompense  
them for the trouble and expense we must, of course, be to them.  
</p><p>``The farmer held a whispered consultation with his wife,  
and I remember well his harsh, loud tones as he came back to  
aunt Polly:  
   <pb/>   
</p><p>`` `They'll <hi rend="italic">have</hi> to stay, I s'pose; there  
don't seem no help  
for it now. There's pertaters in the cellar, an' they can roast an'  
eat what they want. I'll give 'em salt an' what milk an' brown  
bread they want, an' that's what they'll have to live on for the  
present. As for housin' 'em, the boys can sleep on the hay in the  
barn, an' the girls can camp down on rugs an' comforters on the  
kitchen floor. that's the best I can do, an' if they ain't satisfied  
they can go furder.'  
</p><p>``I remember just how he looked down at the troubled,  
childish faces upturned to his own, as if half hoping we might  
conclude to wander yet farther away from our imperilled homes;  
but Aunt Polly hastened to answer:  
</p><p>`` `Oh, we'll get along nicely with milk for the little ones,  
and potatoes and salt for the big boys and girls, and we won't  
trouble you any more nor any longer than we can help, Mr.  
Gubtil.'  
</p><p>``She stood upon the door-stone beside him as she spoke, a  
little, bent, slightly deformed figure, with a face shrivelled and  
faded like a winter-russet apple in spring-time, and a dress  
patched and darned till one scarcely could tell what the original  
was like, in a striking contrast to the tall, broad-shouldered, hale  
old man, whose iron frame had defied the storms of more than  
seventy winters; but I remember how he seemed to me a mere  
pigmy by the side of the generous, large-hearted woman whose  
tones and gestures had a protectiveness, a strength born of love  
and pity, that reassured us trembling little fugitives in spite of  
our ungracious reception. We felt that Aunt Polly would take  
care of us, let what would come.  
</p><p>``The hours dragged slowly away. Aunt Polly told us that  
the distant firing meant that our men had not retreated without  
an effort to defend the village. When this firing ceased, we  
began to watch and hope that some message would come from  
   <pb/>   
our fathers and mothers. But none came. We wondered among  
our little selves if they all had been put to death by the British,  
and even the oldest among us shed some dreary tears.  
</p><p>``Dan Parsons, who was the biggest boy among us and of  
an adventurous turn, went in the gathering twilight gloom down  
as near the village as he dared. He came shivering back to us  
with such tales of vague horror that our very hearts stopped  
beating while we listened.  
</p><p>`` `I crep' along under the shadder of the alders and black-berry bushes,' he began, ` 'til I got close ter De'con Milleses house.  
'Twas as still as death 'round there, but jest as I turned the corner  
by the barn I see somethin' gray a-flappin' and a-flutterin' jest  
inside the barn door. I stopped, kind o' wonderin' what it could  
be, when all at once I thought I should 'a' dropped, for it came  
over me like a flash that it might be'&mdash;  
</p><p>`` `What, what, Dan?' cried a score of frightened voices;  
and Dan replied solemnly:  
</p><p>`` `<hi rend="italic">The old deacon's skulp!</hi>'  
</p><p>`` `Oh dear! oh dear!' sobbed the terrified chorus.  
</p><p>``Aunt Polly could do nothing with us; and little Dolly  
Miles, the deacon's granddaughter, burst into a series of wild  
lamentations that called Farmer Gubtil to the door to know the  
cause of the commotion.  
</p><p>`` `What's all this hullabaloo about?' he asked crossly; and  
when he had heard the story he seized Dan and shook him till  
his teeth chattered.  
</p><p>`` `What do you mean by tellin' such stuff an' scarin' these  
young ones ter death?' he demanded.  
</p><p>``Dan wriggled himself from his grasp and looked sulkily  
defiant:  
</p><p>`` `I didn't say <hi rend="italic">'twas</hi> that,' he muttered.  
'I said it <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be,  
an' p'r'aps 'twas; or it might 'a' been the deacon's old mare  
   <pb/>   
switchin' 'er tail ter keep off the flies. I'm sure <hi rend="italic">I</hi> don't know  
which 'twas. But girls are always a-squealin' at nothin'.'  
</p><p>``And with this parting fling at us tearful ones, Dan turned  
in the direction of the barn; but I was too anxious to hear from  
father and mother to let him go without a word more. `Dan,'  
I whispered with my hand on his arm, `did you see or hear anything  
of <hi rend="italic">our</hi> folks?'  
</p><p>`` `No!' was the rather grump reply; `after what I saw at  
the deacon's I didn't want ter ventur' furder, but from there I  
could see 'em lightin' fires in the village, an' I don't doubt by  
this time that most o' the houses is in flames.'  
</p><p>``With this comforting assurance Dan went off to his bed  
upon the haymow, and I crept back into the house and laid my  
tired head down upon Aunt Polly's motherly lap, where, between  
my sobs, I managed to tell what Dan had told me.  
</p><p>Aunt Polly laid a caressing hand upon my hair: `La,  
child,' said she soothingly, `don't you worry yourself a bit over  
Dan Parson's stories. That boy was <hi rend="italic">born</hi> to tell  
stories. The  
Britishers are bad enough, but they ain't heathen savages, an' if  
the town has surrendered, as I calc'late it has, the settlers will be  
treated like prisoners o' war. There won't be no sculpin' nor  
burnin' o' houses&mdash;no, dear. And now,' giving me a little  
reassuring pat, `you're all tired out, an' ought ter be asleep. I'll  
make up a bed on this rug with a cushion under your head, an'  
my big plaid shawl over you, an' you'll sleep jest as sound as if  
you was ter home in your own trundle-bed.'  
</p><p>``Little Sally shared my rug and shawl, and Aunt Polly,  
gently refusing the ungracious civility of the old couple, who  
had offered her the use of their spare bedroom, after seeing every  
little, tired form made as comfortable as possible with quilts and  
blankets from the farmwife's stores, laid herself down upon the  
floor beside us, after commending herself and us to the God  
   <pb/>   
she loved and trusted, raised her head and spoke to us once  
more in her sweet, hopeful, quavering old tones:  
</p><p>`` `Good night, dears! Go to sleep and don't be a bit afraid.  
I shouldn't wonder if your folks come for you in the mornin'.'  
</p><p>``What comfort there was in her words! And even the  
very little ones, who had never been away from their mothers a  
night before in their lives, stopped their low sobbing and nestled  
down to sleep, sure that God and Aunt Polly would let no harm  
come to them.  
</p><p>``The next day passed slowly and anxiously for us all. From  
a stray traveller Aunt Polly learned that the village was still in  
the hands of the British and&mdash;what was no little comfort to us  
&mdash;that no violence had been done to the place or its inhabitants.  
Some of the older boys were for venturing to return, but Aunt  
Polly held them back with her prudent arguments. If their  
parents had considered it safe for them to come home they  
would have sent for them. The British, she said, had been  
known to impress boys, as well as men, into service, and the  
wisest way was to keep out of their sight.  
</p><p>``The gentle, motherly advice prevailed, and even Dan  
Parsons contented himself with climbing the tallest trees in the  
vicinity, from which he could see the chimneys of several of the  
nearest houses. From these pinnacles he would call out to us at  
intervals:  
</p><p>`` `The smoke comin' out o' Deacon Mileses chimly has a  
queer look, somethin' like burnin' feathers I shouldn't wonder  
a mite if them Britishers was burnin' up his furnitoor! Sam  
Kelly's folks hain't had a spark o' fire in their fireplace to-day.  
Poor critters! Mebbe there ain't nobody left ter want one.'  
</p><p>``With these dismal surmises, Dan managed to keep our  
forlorn little flock as uncomfortable as even he could wish; and  
as the second night drew on, I suppose the homesickness of the  
   <pb/>   
smaller ones must have been pitiful to see. Aunt Polly patted  
and cuddled the forlorn little things to the best of her ability,  
but it was past midnight before the last weary, sobbing baby was  
fairly asleep, while all night long one or another would start up  
terrified from some frightful dream, to be soothed into quiet by  
the patient motherly tenderness of their wakeful protector.  
</p><p>``Next morning the brow of the farmer wore an ominous  
frown, and his wife, as she distributed to each the scant measure  
of brown bread and milk remarked, grudgingly, that she should  
think 'twas 'bout time that her house was cleared of a crowd o'  
hungry, squallin' young ones; and then Mr. Gubtil took out his  
account-book and wrote down the name of each child, with an  
estimate of the amount of bread, milk and potatoes consumed by  
each. He did this with the audible remark that `if folks thought  
he was a-feedin' an' a-housin' their young ones for nothin' they'd  
find themselves mightily mistaken.'  
</p><p>``The third morning dragged slowly away. Dinner was  
over and still no message for us forlorn little ones. At last Aunt  
Polly slowly arose from her seat upon the doorstep, with the  
light of a strong, courageous resolve on her little face.  
</p><p>``Children!' she called loudly, and after we had gathered  
at her call, she spoke to us with an encouraging smile:  
</p><p>`` `I've made up my mind that 'twon't be best for us to stay  
here another night. We're in the way, and the little ones would  
be better off at home with their mothers. We know that the  
fightin' is all over, and I don't believe the English soldiers'll  
be bad enough to hurt a lot o' little helpless children, 'specially  
if they're under a flag o' truce.'  
</p><p>``Here she drew a handkerchif from her pocket. This she  
fastened carefully to a stick. Then putting it into the hands of  
my brother Ben, a well-grown lad of twelve, she went on with  
her directions:  
   <pb/>   
</p><p>`` `We'll form in procession, just as we came, and you,  
Benjie, may march at the head with this white flag a-wavin' to  
let them know that we come in peace. I'll follow next with the  
biggest boys, and the girls, with the little ones, must keep behind  
where it's safest.'  
</p><p>``Perhaps it was the contagion of Aunt Polly's cheerful  
courage, but more likely it was the blessed hope of seeing home  
and father and mother again, that made the little folks so prompt  
to obey her directions. We formed ourselves in line in less time  
than it takes to tell about it; we elder girls took charge of the wee  
ones who were so rejoiced to leave the inhospitable roof of the  
Gubtils' that they forgot all their fears of the terrible English,  
and trotted along as blithely over the deserted road as if not a  
fear had ever terrified their childish hearts, and as if English  
soldiers were still simply those far-off monsters that had served  
as bugbears to frighten them now and then into obedience to  
maternal authority.  
</p><p>``The Gubtils watched us off without a word of encouragement  
or friendliness. Aunt Polly walked close behind the flag-bearer with a firm step, but I could see that she was very pale,  
and when we came to descend the little hill that led into the  
village, and when just at its foot, where then stood the grocery of  
old Penn Parker, we caught a glimpse of the scarlet uniforms  
of several soldiers loafing about&mdash;then even we children could  
see that her steps faltered; and I remember I thought she was  
fearful of some violence.  
</p><p>``But the next moment she was walking steadily along again  
as if no thought of danger or retreat had ever entered her mind;  
and as we came opposite the grocery and a tall man in  
an officer's uniform strolled out toward us with a curious,  
questioning look upon his handsome face, she gave the word of  
command to her little brigade in a voice as clear as a bell:  
   <pb/>   
</p><p>`` `Halt, children!'  
</p><p>``We all stood still as mice, eying the stranger with looks  
in which fear and admiration were probably curiously blended,  
while Aunt Polly, taking the white flag from her color-bearer,  
advanced with a firm front to meet the foe who now, reinforced  
by several men, stood beside the way, evidently wondering what  
this queer parade was about.  
</p><p>`` `Sir!' and Aunt Polly's voice trembled perceptibly but she  
waved the white flag manfully under his very nose, `sir, I  
demand a safe passage for these innocent children to their different  
homes.'  
</p><p>``The officer stared, and his mouth twitched mischievously  
as if he had hard work to keep from laughing outright. But  
he was a gentleman; and when he spoke, he spoke like one.  
</p><p>`` `My good woman,' he said kindly, `these children are  
nothing to me. If you wish permission for them to go to their  
own homes you are welcome to it, though in what way the matter  
concerns me I must confess I am at a loss to imagine.''  
</p><p>Then, and not till then, Aunt Polly broke down and sobbed  
aloud:  
</p><p>`` `Run, children,' she cried as soon as she could speak; `go  
home just as fast as you can scud; an' tell your folks,' she added  
with a gust of gratitude, `that there's worse folks in the world  
than an Englishman.'  
</p><p>``You may be sure that we waited for no further urging;  
and as we flew, rather than ran, in the direction of our different  
homes, I heard the irrepressible burst of laughter with which  
the officer and his men received the grateful spinster's compliment  
which, to the day of her death, she loved to repeat whenever  
she told the thrilling story of her adventure with the English  
officer, `when Hampden was took by the British in 1814;'  
always concluding with this candid admission:  
   <pb/>   
</p><p>`` `An' really, now, if he'd 'a' been anybody but an Englishman,  
an' an inimy, I should 'a' said that I never sot eyes on a better-built, more mannerly man, in all my born days.' ''

BARBARA FRIETCHIE.  
</head>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> UP from the meadows rich with corn,</l>  
<l> Clear in the cool September morn,</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> The clustered spires of Frederick stand</l>  
<l> Green-walled by the hills of Maryland.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> Round about them orchards sweep,</l>  
<l> Apple and peach-tree fruited deep,</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> Fair as a garden of the Lord</l>  
<l> To the eyes of the famished rebel horde,</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> On that pleasant morn of the early fall,</l>  
<l> When Lee marched over the mountain-wall&mdash;</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> Over the mountains winding down,</l>  
<l> Horse and foot, into Frederick town&mdash;</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> Forty flags with their silver stars,</l>  
<l> Forty flags with their crimson bars,</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> Flapped in the morning wind: the sun</l>  
<l> Of noon looked down, and saw not one.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then,</l>  
<l> Bowed with her fourscore years and ten;</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> Bravest of all in Frederick town,</l>  
<l> She took up the flag the men hauled down:</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> In her attic window the staff she set,</l>  
<l> To show that one heart was loyal yet.</l>  
</lg>  
   <pb/>   
<lg type="poem">  
<l> Up the street came the rebel tread,</l>  
<l> Stonewall Jackson riding ahead.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> Under his slouched hat, left and right,</l>  
<l> He glanced: the old flag met his sight.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> ``Halt''&mdash;the dust-brown ranks stood fast,</l>  
<l> ``Fire!''&mdash;out blazed the rifle-blast.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> It shivered the window, pane and sash;</l>  
<l> It rent the banner with seam and gash.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> Quick as it fell from the broken staff,</l>  
<l> Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf;</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> She leaned far out on the window sill,</l>  
<l> And shook it forth with a royal will.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> ``Shoot if you must this old gray head,&mdash;</l>  
<l> But spare your country's flag,'' she said.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> A shade of sadness, a blush of shame,</l>  
<l> Over the face of the leader came;</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> The nobler nature within him stirred</l>  
<l> To life at that woman's deed and word.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> ``Who touches a hair of yon gray head</l>  
<l> Dies like a dog! March on!'' he said.</l>

<l> All day long through Frederick street</l>  
<l> Sounded the tread of marching feet.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">

<l> Over the heads of the rebel host;</l>  
</lg>

<lg type="poem">  
<l> Ever its torn folds rose and fell</l>  
<l> On the loyal winds that loved it well;</l>

<lg type="poem">  
<l> And through the hill-gaps, sunset light</l>  
<l> Shone over it with a warm good-night.</l>

<l> Barbara Frietchie's work is o'er,</l>

SHERIDAN'S RIDE.

<note><p>  
(Used by special arrangement with J. B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia,  
publisher of Mr. Read's Poems.)  
</p></note>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> UP from the South at break of day,</l>  
<l> Bringing to Winchester fresh dismay,</l>  
<l> The affrighted air with a shudder bore,</l>  
<l> Like a herald in haste, to the chieftain's door,</l>  
<l> The terrible grumble and rumble and roar,</l>  
<l> Telling the battle was on once more,</l>  
<l> And Sheridan twenty miles away.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> And wilder still those billows of war</l>  
<l> Thundered along the horizon's bar,</l>  
<l> And louder yet into Winchester rolled</l>  
<l> The roar of that red sea uncontrolled,</l>  
<l> Making the blood of the listener cold</l>  
<l> As he thought of the stake in that fiery fray,</l>  
<l> And Sheridan twenty miles away.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> But there is a road from Winchester town,</l>  
<l> A good, broad highway leading down;</l>  
<l> And there through the flash of the morning light,</l>  
<l> A steed as black as the steeds of night,</l>  
<l> Was seen to pass as with eagle's flight&mdash;</l>  
<l> As if he knew the terrible need,</l>  
<l> He stretched away with the utmost speed;</l>  
<l> Hills rose and fell&mdash;but his heart was gay,</l>  
<l> With Sheridan fifteen miles away.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">   
<l> Still sprung from these swift hoofs, thundering South,</l>  
<l> The dust, like the smoke from the cannon's mouth,</l>  
   <pb/>   
<l> Or the trail of a comet sweeping faster and faster,</l>  
<l> Foreboding to traitors the doom of disaster;</l>  
<l> The heart of the steed and the heart of the master,</l>  
<l> Were beating like prisoners assaulting their walls,</l>  
<l> Impatient to be where the battle-field calls;</l>  
<l> Every nerve of the charger was strained to full play,</l>  
<l> With Sheridan only ten miles away.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> Under his spurning feet the road</l>  
<l> Like an arrowy Alpine river flowed;</l>  
<l> And the landscape sped away behind</l>  
<l> Like an ocean flying before the wind.</l>  
<l> And the steed, like a bark fed with furnace ire,</l>  
<l> Swept on with his wild eyes full of fire,</l>  
<l> But lo! he is nearing his heart's desire&mdash;</l>  
<l> He is snuffing the smoke of the roaring fray,</l>  
<l> With Sheridan only five miles away.</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> The first that the General saw were the groups</l>  
<l> Of stragglers, and then the retreating troops;</l>  
<l> What was done&mdash;what to do&mdash;a glance told him both,</l>  
<l> And striking his spurs with a terrible oath,</l>  
<l> He dashed down the line 'mid a storm of huzzahs,</l>  
<l> And the wave of retreat checked its course there because</l>  
<l> The sight of the master compelled it to pause.</l>  
<l> With foam and with dust the black charger was gray,</l>  
<l> By the flash of his eye, and his red nostrils' play,</l>  
<l> He seemed to the whole great army to say,</l>  
<l> ``I have brought you Sheridan all the way</l>  
<l> From Winchester down to save the day!''</l>  
</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> Hurrah, hurrah for Sheridan!</l>  
<l> Hurrah, hurrah for horse and man!</l>  
   <pb/>   
<l> And when their statues are placed on high</l>  
<l> Under the dome of the Union sky&mdash;</l>  
<l> The American soldiers' Temple of Fame&mdash;</l>  
<l> There with the glorious General's name</l>  
<l> Be it said in letters both bold and bright:</l>  
<l> ``Here is the steed that saved the day</l>  
<l> By carrying Sheridan into the fight,</l>  
<l> From Winchester&mdash;twenty miles away!''</l>

</lg>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l> A sudden rush from the stairway,</l>

CARYL'S PLUM.  
</head>  
<lg type="poem">  
<l>            ``He put in his thumb</l>  
<l>            And pulled out a plum.''</l>  
</lg>  
<p>  
SO sang Caryl over the stairs.  
</p><p>``Now if <hi rend="italic">he</hi> pulled out a plum, why shouldn't  
<hi rend="italic">she</hi>?''  
she said to herself, halting a bit by the landing window.  
``And a good big plum too&mdash;nice and juicy. O Aunt Sylvia,  
Aunt Sylvia!''  
</p><p>She fairly hugged herself in glee, then drew one long  
breath and dashed on to her own poor little room.   
</p><p>``Oh, you here, Viny?'' she exclamed{sic} in surprise as she flung  
open the door.  
</p><p>A small figure rose to a perpendicular position in front of  
the old bureau, while a shoving-to of the under drawer  
proclaimed some attention having been paid to the pretty laces,  
ribbons, and various other adornments packed away for safe  
keeping.  
</p><p>Caryl remembered leaving the key in the drawer after taking  
out a bit of lavender ribbon the night before for Aunt  
Sylvia's cap.  
</p><p>``What have you been doing?'' she asked sharply; and taking  
hold of the small wiry shoulder, she looked down into a little  
black face whose eyes were staring solemnly into the farthest  
corner of the room.  
</p><p>``Ben doin'?'' repeated Viny, scared almost to death  
inwardly, but preserving a cool exterior. ``Nothin', only shettin'  
the draw'; plaguey thing wouldn't stay put. Tore my dress,''  
she added mumblingly to fill out the pause.  
</p><p>``Where?'' said Caryl, looking sharply at her.  
</p><p>``Dar,'' said Viny, with a violent twist, so that she could  
   <pb/>   
compass the back breadths of her blue gingham frock, and she  
pointed abruptly to a cat-a-cornered rent.  
</p><p>``Oh, no, you didn't,'' contradicted Caryl, looking her  
through and through, and giving her a small shake, ``tear that  
either; I heard Maum Patty scold you yesterday for letting Jip  
bite it and snip out a piece.''  
</p><p>``Well, somefin tore,'' said Viny. ``I donno whar 'tis, but  
it's somewhars. A mighty smart tare, too, Miss Ca.''  
</p><p>``I'll lock, and lock, and lock,'' declared the young girl, now  
down on her knees before her precious drawer, ``before I run the  
chance of your rummaging fingers getting here again. Now  
then, Viny!''  
</p><p>``Yes'm,'' said the little black girl obsequiously, and rolling  
her eyes to all quarters; ``Oh, yes'm!''  
</p><p>``We are going to move, Viny,'' said her young mistress,  
taking the key out of its lock, and turning her back on drawers  
and contents, to sit on the floor with hands folded in her lap  
while she watched the effect of her words.  
</p><p>``<hi rend="italic">Move</hi>?'' echoed Viny with a start; ``Oh,  
lawks! whatever's  
dat, Miss?''  
</p><p>``Why, go to a new place,'' said Caryl, laughing in spite of  
herself. ``For mercy's sake, child, do take your eyes in! It'll  
be very fine, Viny, oh, so fine!'' she cried enthusiastically.  
</p><p>``An' lib here nebber no mo'?'' cried the little black figure  
in a shrill scream; ``wot, an' hev no leaky sink dat keps me  
a-swashin' and a-swashin', an' no old ruf dat lets in hull buckets  
full o' water onter de bed, an'&mdash;''  
</p><p>``No,'' said Caryl, interrupting the steady stream of invective  
against the old heuse, ``everything's to be as new and nice  
and neat as a pin, Viny&mdash;sinks and everything else; you can't  
begin to think how splendid it's to be!''</p>  
   <pb/>   
<p>``I'm goin' to tell gramma,'' cried Viny, wholly off her  
balance, ``dis berry same minnit. Lawks! but won't she be tickled  
to leave the ole shell! Den I'll git my bunnet an' go wid yer,  
Miss Ca, in tree shakes of a lobster's whisker!''  
</p><p>She scampered in the greatest excitement to the door, when  
a detaining pull on the end of her long apron, brought her to a  
full stop.  
</p><p>``You are crazy, child!'' exclaimed Caryl, bursting into a  
laugh and holding her fast. ``We can't go this moment, no  
matter how bad the old house is. Listen, Viny!''  
</p><p>But the small figure flung itself into a heap on the floor so  
suddenly that she nearly pulled her young mistress with her,  
while the little black hands clapped themselves over the bead  
like eyes, wail after wail of disappointment making the room  
to ring.  
</p><p>``Will you <hi rend="italic">stop!</hi>'' cried Caryl in perfect  
despair. ``Aunt  
Sylvia's head will snap with your noise! If you don't stop crying,  
Viny, you sha'n't go when the rest of us are ready to move,  
so there, now.''  
</p><p>Threats had the power to do what nothing else could. Viny  
wiped off all the tears with the backs of her grimy little paws,  
gave two or three concluding sniffs, sat up straight, and was  
immediately all right for further developments.  
</p><p>``Now then''&mdash;Caryl pointed off her sentences briskly on the  
tips of her rosy fingers&mdash;``you must try to help&mdash;well, an awful  
great deal, Viny, yourself, or else it can't be a moving for any  
single one of us.''  
</p><p>Viny's eyes widened fearfully, but she didn't stir.  
</p><p>``If you will take care&mdash;mind! <hi rend="italic">splendid</hi> care  
of Aunt Sylvia  
every morning,'' said Caryl slowly and with extreme <hi rend="italic">empressment</hi>&mdash;  
``watch and get her everything she wants, not wait for  
   <pb/>   
her to ask for anything, then I can go off down street  
and make lots and lots of money, Viny. Think of that, lots  
and lots! Then we can move, and Aunt Sylvia will maybe get  
well.''  
</p><p>Caryl's gray eyes were only a thought less big than those of  
her small black audience, who presently caught the infectious  
enthusiasm and emitted several lusty crows.  
</p><p>``Jiminy&mdash;oh, I <hi rend="italic">didn't</hi> say it&mdash;I didn't&mdash;I  
didn't! O Jiminy,  
I didn't&mdash;I didn't&mdash;O Jimmy, I&mdash;''  
</p><p>``Stop saying it, then,'' exclaimed her young mistress  
decidedly, and enforcing her words by a vigorous shake.  
</p><p>``Oh, I didn't&mdash;I will&mdash;O Jiminy! yes, I will!'' cried the  
little black delinquent, the full tide of original sin taking an  
unfair advantage of her excitement to engulf her. ``Oh&mdash;er&mdash;  
oh&mdash;er&mdash;r&mdash;''  
</p><p>Caryl came to her rescue by giving her a new idea.  
</p><p>``See how splendid you can be, Viny dear,'' she said kindly.  
``You can be such a good little helper, so that part of the new  
home will be of your getting; for I never could have the chance  
to earn anything if you didn't take my place and be Aunt Sylvia's  
nurse.''  
</p><p>``I know how,'' said Viny, perfectly overcome with the  
greatness thrust upon her; ``it's to slip crickets under her feet  
to put her toes onter. I'll slip 'em all day. An' it's to wipe her  
specs, an' to say yes, no, an' to&mdash;''  
</p><p>``To be good,'' finished Caryl solemnly; ``that comprehends  
the whole business.''  
</p><p>``To be good,'' repeated the small nurse yet more solemnly,  
``an' to compren' the whole bus'ness; I will.''  
</p><p>``You are a ridiculous child,'' cried Caryl impatiently; ``I  
don't really suppose you are fit to be trusted, but then, it's the only  
thing to try.''

</p><p>Viny, having been duly elected to office, considered her  
honors settled, so she was little disturbed by any opinions that  
might be held concerning her. Therefore she squatted and  
wriggled in great delight, grinning at every word that fell from  
her young mistress' lips.  
</p><p>``You see, Viny,'' Caryl was saying, beginning on her  
confidence, ``I've got an order to teach the little Grant girls how to  
paint, and if I can run down there two hours every morning, I'm  
to have twenty-five dollars, and Madam Grant is going to give  
it to me in advance; that is, after the first quarter. Think, Viny,  
<hi rend="italic">twenty-five</hi> dollars!  
That's what we want  
to move with into  
Heart's Delight!''  
</p><p>This was the  
upstairs southwest  
corner of a little cottage  
that for a year or  
more had been the  
desideratum of the  
young girl's highest  
hopes that had to  
wear themselves out  
in empty longings,  
the invalid's scanty  
exchequer only  
sufficing for doctor's  
bills and similar  
luxuries. They had  
lived in the old house  
now for many a  
twelvemonth, along  
    
 <pb/>   
 
with several other broken-down lodgers whose slender means  
compelled them to call this place ``home''&mdash;this place where  
never a bit of sunshine seemed to come; where even the birds  
hated to stop for a song as they flew merrily over the tree-tops.  
And no wonder. The trees were scraggy, loppy old things  
hanging down in dismal sweep over the leaky roof and damp  
walls. They had to stay&mdash;the lodgers, but the birds and the  
sunshine tossed off the whole responsibility of life in such a  
gloomy old home, and flitted to gayer quarters. But now, what  
if Heart's Delight could really be theirs!  
</p><p>``Yer goin' ter tell 'em how to paint dem tings yer daub?''  
broke in Viny, and snapping off this delightful thought.  
</p><p>``You shouldn't speak so, child,'' said Caryl with the greatest  
dignity; ``it's very fine work, and you couldn't possibly understand  
it. It's art, Viny.''  
</p><p>``Ho, ho!'' laughed the small black figure, nowise impressed  
and cramming her stumpy fingers up to her mouth to keep the  
laugh in as she saw her young mistress' displeasure. ``It's an  
awful old dirty muss, an' I wish I could do it,'' she added under  
her breath.  
</p><p>``And I shall begin tomorrow,'' declared Caryl with still  
greater dignity, and drawing herself to her full height. ``Aunt  
Sylvia says she'll try you. Now you'll be good, won't you?'' she  
added anxiously. ``It's only for two hours a day, Viny.''  
</p><p>``I'll be good,'' declared Viny, `` 'strue's I live an' breeve.''  
Meanwhile the darkest of plans ran riot in her little black head.  
</p><p>``Heart's Delight&mdash;Heart's Delight!'' sang Caryl's happy  
voice all that day; and like St. Patrick's poor imprisoned snake,  
she began to feel that to-morrow would never come.  
</p><p>But hours come and go, and Caryl awoke the next morning,  
the brightest, cheeriest morning that ever called a happy girl out  
of bed.  
   <pb/>   
</p><p>``Aunt Sylvia won't have many more days in that dark little  
room of hers,'' she cried to herself, throwing on her clothes  
rapidly. ``Oh, dear, where <hi rend="italic">are</hi> the pins? I can't  
bear to wait a  
minute any more than Viny, when I think of that dear lovely nest,  
and the bay-window, and all that sunshine. I'll always have it  
full of flowers, and the bird shall sing all the time, and&mdash;and&mdash;  
and&mdash;''  
</p><p>The rest was lost in a dash of cold water over the rosy face,  
and Caryl soon presented herself at her aunt's bedside.  
</p><p>``I'll do well enough while you are gone,'' said her aunt,  
smiling up from the pillows into the bright face above hers.  
``Now you're not to worry about me in the least, for you cannot  
do justice to yourself if your mind is troubled. Remember,  
Caryl, and be thorough in your efforts to teach your little pupils.''  
</p><p>``And Madam Grant is going to buy some of my panels and  
little plaques, I almost know,'' cried Caryl, bustling around for  
her aunt's long woolen wrapper and her day slippers, ``for she  
told me she should want to see them some time. Then, Auntie&mdash;  
oh, then!''  
</p><p>The young girl in her eagerness climbed upon the old bed  
to lay her fresh young cheek against the pale thin one. How she  
longed to put brightness into the poor invalid's life!  
</p><p>``Remember,'' said Aunt Sylvia lightly, to hide the tears in  
her voice, ``your fortune's to be made. Only be prompt and  
thorough, and put your whole mind to your work. That is the  
secret of success.''  
</p><p>``I will, Auntie, oh, I <hi rend="italic">will!</hi>'' cried Caryl  
happily, ``and Viny  
will do well, I guess,'' she added, the gleeful tones dropping  
down with an anxious note.  
</p><p>``Viny will prove a capital little nurse, I expect,'' said Miss  
Sylvia cheerfully; ``now the day won't wait, Caryl, so get your  
old auntie up.''  
   <pb/>   
</p><p>``My old auntie is just <hi rend="italic">lovely</hi>,'' cried the  
girl, hopping off  
from the bed, and flying around merrily, well pleased at last  
when the invalid was in her chair, to see a little faint, pink color  
stealing up the wan cheek.  
</p><p>``The best cap, Aunt Sylvia&mdash;the best cap!'' she cried,  
running for the one with the fresh lavender ribbons.  
</p><p>``What an extravagant puss!'' exclaimed Aunt Sylvia, willing  
to humor the gay little heart, and tapping her cheek as the  
young girl settled the cap on the lovely gray hair.  
</p><p>``Everything must be best to-day,'' cried Caryl recklessly.  
``It's all fresh and new and fine! All the world is made just  
for us.''  
</p><p>Maum Patty saw Caryl run down the dirty little brick path  
that served for all the lodgers in the old house as a walk to the  
broken-down gate, with her color-box under her arm, and her  
little roll of pictures in her hand, and heaved a sigh from her  
ample bosom.  
</p><p>``Dat chile can't make no fortin' like she's a-tinkin' of, but  
laws! let her try. Here, yer Viny, yer, be off up to de Missis'  
room. Scat now! De pore lettle lamb,'' she mourned, as her  
hopeful grandchild unwillingly dragged her recreant feet off to  
her duties, leaving her grandmother to pursue her reflections in  
peace, ``it mos' busts my heart to see her a-workin' an' de Missis  
keepin' up an' pretendin' she's as fine as a queen. 'Twarn't so in  
ole Patty's day. Den dar wos plenty-pies and turkeys. Lors,  
what stumpers! An' hull bar'ls o' flour, an' sugar, an' a creation  
sight of eberyting in de beyeutiful house, an' now look at dis  
ole shell!''  
</p><p>Maum Patty tossed her turban in intense scorn at each of the  
dark soot-begrimed walls of the place called kitchen.  
</p><p>``Missis ud feel more like folks,'' she said at each disdainful  
scrutiny, ``an' like as not git well, ef we cud cut sticks inter  
anudder home. Ef de chile only <hi rend="italic">cud</hi> do it!''  
   <pb/>   
</p><p>She peered anxiously down the dirty little brick walk again,  
then fetched a still longer sigh.  
</p><p>``I don't darst to!'' she declared in a mighty burst at last.  
``I don't, cos wot ud keep us all from the pore-'us den. It's every  
speck I kin do ter keep along of de Miss an' Car'l an' take keer of  
'em wi'dout a cent o' pay; I don't darst tech my stockin' bag in  
de bank.''  
</p><p>Maum Patty always spoke of her scanty savings deposited in  
the neighboring bank, in this way, fondly supposing them in the  
original condition in which ten years ago, she had taken them  
there for future shield against sickness and old age.  
</p><p>Meantime the little black nurse had begun her work.  
</p><p>Peering around Miss Sylvia's half-closed door, Viny  
exclaimed to herself, ``Umph! she don't want me; guess she's  
a'readin' now. I'll git into Miss Ca's room an' try on all her  
clo'es an' pertend I'm makin' calls, an' peek inter ebery single  
place whar I kin, an' I'll be a lady, an' dar sha'n't no one scold  
Viny.''  
</p><p>``Viny,'' called Miss Sylvia's soft voice, hearing a rustle at  
the door.  
</p><p>``Dat's Jip she's a-talkin' ter, I reckon,'' said Viny, stealing  
off on her tiptoes down the hall, and sticking her fingers in her  
ears that she might hear no more troublesome conscience calls;  
``I seen him on de rug when I peeked in de crack. Now den&mdash;  
Whoop, says I, <hi rend="italic">Whoop!</hi>''  
</p><p>She was safe now in Caryl's room, where the first thing she  
did was to indulge in a series of somersaults over the floor, and  
also, for variety, over the neat little white bed. These afforded  
her intense comfort. When she came up bright and shining after  
this celebration of her independence, she drew herself up with a  
serious face and proceeded at once to stern business.  
</p><p>``Two hours ain't long,'' she observed wisely, ``an' I mus'  
   <pb/>   
be back some of de time. Jiminy! she's forgot de key again!''  
In truth, Caryl in her great excitement of hunting for some  
pictures packed away in her precious drawer, had forgotten to  
pocket the key that protected her few treasures.  
</p><p>Ruthlessly, then, they were pulled out and overhauled, while  
Viny reveled in each new discovery, chattering softly to herself  
in glee. She tied on all the bright bits of ribbons she could lay  
her hands on, to the little tiny tails adorning her head. She  
twisted with great difficulty into a delicate white spenser that  
Caryl's mother had worn when a girl, saved for its tender  
reminiscence, and for the soft, fine old lace that would be of use to the  
young daughter by and by. Viny was nowise disturbed in her  
enjoyment at certain ominous crackings and creakings that proclaimed  
the giving way of the delicate material. Arrayed at  
last to her satisfaction, although the lace did hang down in some  
shreds where her impatient fingers had clutched it, she whirled  
and whirled in front of the old-fashioned glass with many grimaces,  
trying the effect of her new costume.  
</p><p>``I want sumfin to shine,'' she said at last, tired of this;  
``jew-<hi rend="italic">el</hi>lery an' stuns. Le's see ef she's got  
any.''  
</p><p>Now in one corner of Caryl's drawer was a small black  
box; unfortunately, the lock was broken in childhood, and there  
had been no money to spare for repairs of anything of that sort,  
so she had tied it securely with the strongest of twine, and written  
on the cover in big schoolgirl hand the words, ``DON'T ANY ONE  
DARE TO TOUCH!'' Although Viny was unable to decipher the  
writing in the least, it was fun enough to attack the string, which  
presently succumbed to the violent onslaught of tooth and nail,  
and the precious, precious bits of brightness were soon at the  
mercy of the little black fingers.  
</p><p>Maum Patty was droning away in the kitchen some old  
Methodist hymns. Viny was dimly conscious of a faint call  
   <pb/>   
from the invalid's room, as she drew out in the utmost delight an  
old-fashioned brooch with a green centre around which were  
some little sparkling things.  
</p><p>She couldn't even say ``Jiminy!'' but simply held the pretty  
thing which seemed glad of its freedom from solitary confinement,  
and thus delighted to sparkle more than ever in its resting-place in the little black hand. With trembling fingers she  
fastened it into the centre of the lace spenser, above her naughty  
little bosom, hurrying to the glass to do so, and had just taken  
one look, when a low cry of distress struck upon her ear.  
</p><p>It filled her whole soul with dismay, rooting her like a little  
frozen thing to the spot. It was Miss Sylvia, she knew.  
</p><p>With one mighty effort she tore herself from the spot, and  
rushed headlong into the hall. ``Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;<hi rend="italic">oh!</hi>'' came  
from the  
invalid's room.  
</p><p>At that Viny wrung her hands and writhed in dire distress.  
</p><p>``She's a-dyin'!'' she gasped, her knees knocking together in  
a lively manner; ``I don't darst to look&mdash;I don't!&mdash;I've killed  
her!'' And the whole flood of remorse sweeping her very soul,  
she turned and scuttled down the crooked little stairs and into  
the street.  
</p><p>``A doctor!'' was all her thought. She remembered hearing  
Caryl say he lived in a big brown house that had lots of flowers  
in the windows. But where upon the face of the earth the house  
was situated, Viny knew no more than a bird. However, she  
must get him, so she dashed blindly on, turning the first corner  
to run headlong into the arms of a portly old lady who was  
placidly enjoying the fresh air and sunshine at the same time that  
she displayed her rich street attire.  
</p><p>``Oh, my goodness!'' cried the old lady, startled out of all  
fine speeches by the collision, and jumping in fright to the  
extreme edge of the curbstone. Then seeing the cause, she cried  
   <pb/>   
in anger, ``You miserable, dirty little thing you, you ve nearly  
killed me!''  
</p><p>At the word ``killed,'' Viny began to dance in terror on the  
sidewalk. ``I know it,'' she cried, ``oh, dear, I know it! she's  
dead, an' grandma 'll beat me.''  
</p><p>``And if you don't know any better,'' cried the old lady,  
vainly trying to settle her gray puffs as they were before, ``than  
to run into people in this way, I'll have you arrested, I will!''  
</p><p>At this Viny was completely overcome. Her guilty  
conscience pictured all sorts of punishments; worse, far worse, than  
``grandma's'' judgments, and, falling on her knees, she grasped  
the old lady's black satin gown and implored for mercy.  
</p><p>The old lady, now her attention was drawn off from her  
own annoyance, settled her eyes on the brooch half concealed by  
a fold of the little lace spenser.  
</p><p>``You wicked, bad child!'' she exclaimed, seizing her arm  
and pouncing one stiffly gloved hand on the sparkling brooch;  
``you've stolen that! It's bad enough to be run into by a dirty  
little thing fresh from Bedlam, without being wicked into the  
bargain. That's <hi rend="italic">too</hi> much!''  
</p><p>The little black figure being too wretched to hear this tirade,  
could only mumble and wail and wriggle closer and closer into  
the folds of the rich gown.  
</p><p>``Get out of my dress!'' cried the old lady excitedly. ``Here,  
I'll call the police; if you don't let go of me this instant! Stop,  
I say! Po-o-lice!''  
</p><p>Viny gave one violent jerk that brought her up to her feet,  
and with eyes distended in terror, started in wild despair across  
the street. A pair of handsome bays were coming in their best  
step down from the Square, drawing a carriage full of people  
who seemed in the very best of spirits.  
</p><p>``<hi rend="italic">Whoa-a!</hi>'' A click, a rapid pull-up with  
all Thomas's best  
   <pb/>   
strength, and the horses fell back on their haunches just in time  
for the little lithe figure to dart under their pawing hoofs and be  
saved! Everybody leaned out of the carriage for a glimpse of  
the child.  
</p><p>``Why&mdash;why''&mdash; A young girl's face paled, while the gray  
eyes flashed, and with one spring she was out and rushing after  
the small flying figure who in her fright had turned to flee the  
other way.  
</p><p>``Look out, Caryl!'' called the others in the carriage after her.  
</p><p>``Oh, she'll be killed,'' moaned a little girl leaning out as  
far as she dared over the wheels.  
</p><p>``And then she can't ever get into the pretty new house,''  
wailed another. ``Oh, what shall we do! Come back, Bessie!''  
she cried, tugging at her sister's skirts. ``Grandmamma, make  
her come into the carriage, I can't hold her!''  
</p><p>But a crowd of people surging up around them at this  
moment, took off all attention from Bessie and everybody else but  
the little fugitive and her kind pursuer. Caryl made her way  
through the crowd with flushed face, her little brown hat hanging  
by its strings around her neck, pantingly dragging after her  
the little black girl.  
</p><p>``It's our Viny,'' she said, ``and something is the matter with  
Aunt Sylvia! Oh, Madam Grant!''  
</p><p>``My poor child,'' said a sweet-faced woman, reaching out  
a kind arm, while the children seized hold of Caryl at every  
available point, between them dragging her and her charge into  
shelter, ``don't be troubled. Drive just as fast as you can,  
Thomas, to No. 27, you know,'' she commanded hurriedly.  
</p><p>Then the first thing Caryl did was to turn upon Viny and  
unhook the precious brooch as a low sob came from her white  
lips. ``If it had been lost!''  
</p><p>A soft hand stole under the little brown cloak to clasp her  
   <pb/>   
own; but Maddam Grant said never a word. She knew what the  
young girl's heart was too full for speech; that the mother's  
brooch would speak more tenderly than ever she could, of  
forgiveness to the little ignorant black girl.  
</p><p>The children were all eyes at Viny and her costume, but  
they said never a word while she howled on steadily, only ejaculating  
in an occasional gust, ``O Miss Sylvy&mdash;Miss Sylvy!''  
</p><p>Caryl, white as a sheet, rushed out of the carriage and into  
the old lodging house the instant the horses paused by the broken  
gate. Maum Patty was singing in the little kitchen the refrain  
she never indulged in except in her most complacent moods.  
Flinging wide the door, Caryl panted out, ``Oh, what is it! Tell  
me at once!''  
</p><p>``Lawks!'' exclaimed Maum Patty, startled from her peaceful  
enjoyment, and turning so suddenly  
in the old calico-covered chair  
that she sent her spectacles spinning  
into the middle of the floor. ``Massy,  
how yer look! Tain't wurth it&mdash;  
don't! He hain't spile't it; I stopped  
him,'' she added exultingly.  
</p><p>``Stopped what?''  
echoed Caryl in  
bewildered distress.  
``Oh, do tell me!  
Is'nt Aunt Sylvia  
sick? Tell me,  
Maum Patty,'' she  
pleaded. And she  
grasped the old  
woman's arm in an agony of suspense.  
</p>  
   <pb/>   
  
<p>``Massy, no!'' declared Maum Patty in her most cheery  
tones, ``she's ben a-laughin' fit to kill herself, an' I don't wonder,  
for the little rascal looked as cunnin' as an imp. But I stopped  
him I stopped him!'' she added triumphantly.  
</p><p>Caryl had no strength to ask further, nor to stir. The reaction  
was too great, and she leaned up against the door for support.  
</p><p>``He shuck it, an' shuck it,'' said the old woman, laughing  
immoderately. ``Laws, how he shuck it&mdash;dat Jip did&mdash;yer  
   <pb/>   
aunt's beyeutiful cap with the new puppel ribbons! Ye see it  
tumbled off; I dunno wedder she sneezed, or wot she did, but  
anyway, it tumbled off on de flo', and dat little pison scamp  
jumped up from his rug an' cotched it, an' she a-callin' an'a-callin,  
fit ver die&mdash;I'll snake dat Viny w'en I gets her.&mdash;Lawks,  
but I couldn't help it! I laughed till I cried to see dat dog carry  
on. Luckily I run up just when I did to pay my 'specs to de  
Missis, for&mdash;I stopped him, I stopped him,'' she brought herself  
up to declare, wiping her eyes.  
</p><p>``Viny,'' said Caryl, in her little room, an hour after, when  
everything had been confessed and forgiven; when the delightful  
story had all come out, how they were really and truly to move  
that very afternoon; how Madam Grant had paid the rent in  
advance for the sunny rooms in the little cottage, and they were  
just driving around to surprise Aunt Sylvia when they witnessed  
Viny's escapade; how the carriage was to come before very long  
to take dear Aunt Sylvia to her longed-for refuge; how the price  
of the lessons was to go for new furniture; how everything for  
the rest of their lives was to be cheery, winsome, and bright to  
the very last degree&mdash;when it was all finished, Caryl looked  
kindly down into the sorry little black face&mdash;``Yes, Viny,'' she  
said with the happiest little laugh, ``I shall have to forgive you,  
for it's the last naughty thing that you will ever do in the old  
home.''</p>
