		The Pot of Paint<lb/>
		By Onoto Watanna</head>
     <p>To a Portuguese great-grandfather the face of Moonshine

owed its peculiar beauty. Moonshine had heard of this

ancestor; a blot he was to her upon the proud Japanese

genealogy of her family, despite the fact that he had been

one of those remarkable Portuguese who brought to Japan the

first knowledge of Western science. When her Japanese

friends remarked that her eyes were yellow instead of black

and her hair waved barbarously, she would apologize very

humbly. But to the few foreigners whom she chanced to meet

in Nagasaki, Moonshine traded on her nationality in order to

win their favor.</p><p>

     This fact, and of course her undoubted beauty, had been

her attraction for Dudley. He was an American of the usual

sort, seeing Japan through rose-colored glasses, marveling

that he was not indeed in another world altogether. Despite

the glamor of the land of poetry and flowers, however, never

for one moment did he lose his own Western point of view.

Nevertheless, he fell in love with Moonshine.</p><p>

     Tomlinson, who was his intimate



<pb n="416"/>



friend and kinsman, had pleaded with him to give up the rash

notion of marrying Moonshine; or, if he must do so, to

follow the example of his countrymen and marry her only in

Japanese fashion. Dudley had answered with a stubborn pride

that would brook no criticism of the girl herself. She was

above reproach. For this reason, and because he honestly

loved her, he intended to marry and protect her with all the

homage he would have given to any woman who became his wife.</p><p>

     Tomlinson had said: &ldquo;She may be good and lovely and all

the rest, you know, old fellow, but you never can tell just

what to expect of these Orientals. The pagan must out in

them.&rdquo; To which Dudley returned:</p><p>

     &ldquo;You forget that she is not entirely Japanese. She has

always had ideas alien to those among whom she has had to

live: she has always felt a stranger here. You will see,

Tomlinson, as my wife, she will absorb in time our Western

way of thinking and living, though I would not have her lose

her charm of Oriental birth.&rdquo; He added with a little

confident laugh:</p><p>

     &ldquo;Really, Tomlinson, we'll make a bewitching little

Christian of her yet.&rdquo;</p><p>

     Tomlinson went to Helen Martin at the Hotel Imperial.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Try and do something to dissuade him from this,&rdquo; he

said to the girl, who was strangely pale over the

intelligence. &ldquo;He will ruin his whole career if he lets this

infatuation get the better of him.&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;If Francis must marry her,&rdquo; said Miss Martin very

gently, &ldquo;we should be thankful that he will do so properly.&rdquo;</p><p>

     Meanwhile, Moonshine made some important purchases at

the chief European store in Nagasaki. In fact, she bought a

corset, a pair of little patent leather shoes, silken hose,

kid gloves, skirts, waists, and a bonnet.</p><p>

     On the day of the wedding, she arrayed herself in all

this finery before the little beveled mirror in her room,

only large enough to reflect back her own exquisite face.

All the morning she had labored on her hair, painfully

endeavoring to dress it after some European mode which she

had seen in an old Parisian fashion plate. The result was a

trifle tousled, but nevertheless quite becoming.</p><p>

     Then she put the corsets on, pulling them hard by the

strings, panting and breathing heavily with the exertion.</p><p>

     &ldquo;I cannot bear this corset long,&rdquo; she said, sighing

hugely. She slipped a skirt on, then the waist, and somehow

or other she managed to fasten them correctly. Next she put

on the bonnet, then the gloves, several sizes too large for

her, and last of all, she sat down on the floor, drawing on

the little high-heeled Parisian shoes.</p><p>

     When she was all quite dressed she slipped out of the

house just as she was, glancing about her fearfully lest she

might encounter some shocked relative. On the road the

little dogs sniffed and barked at her, missing the familiar

sound of her little wooden clogs. She reproved them gently:</p><p>

     &ldquo;Dear my honorable friends,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;certainly you

are not acquainted with any American lady. Some day, maybe,

you will learn.&rdquo;</p><p>

     At the church, they were awaiting her&mdash;Dudley,

Tomlinson, Helen Martin and a fat missionary&mdash;whose deep,

solemn voice made her shiver.</p><p>

     At first, when she came to the door of the church, they

did not recognize her in her changed attire, until she

announced in a queer little subtle voice, as she tried to

make graceful obeisance, despite the horrible corsets that

caused her agony:</p><p>

     &ldquo;Dear my augustnesses, I come!&rdquo;</p><p>

     Dudley started violently and paled all over. His lips

quivered fearfully as he went quickly down the aisle of the

little mission church to meet her.</p><p>

     &ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; he said brokenly to her. &ldquo;It is<ref target="n1">[1]</ref> all

quite wrong&mdash;the clothes&mdash;but you did it for me!&rdquo;</p><p>

     After the first ejaculation of amazement at her changed

appearance, the two witnesses composed themselves, though

Tomlinson said in an audible whisper:</p><p>

     &ldquo;Good Lord! She has come all alone!&rdquo;</p><p>

     She replied to Dudley in a timid <orig reg="under">un-



<pb n="418"/>



der</orig> tone that had a tremor in it:</p><p>

     &ldquo;Pray excuse the honorable rudeness of my honorable

relatives. They doan like me mek marriage with barbarian.

But I also liddle bit like unto you, an' behold I jus'

runnin' away to you elope!&rdquo;</p><p>

     Dudley held her hand closely. She could not altogether

follow the marriage service, but she went through it

bravely, and repeated the beautiful words in a broken

accent, with far less nervousness than Dudley, who was

shaking like an aspen.</p><p>

     After the ceremony, he took her straightway to his

hotel, whence he sent word to her honorable family, which

met in indignant counsel, solemnly and completely to disown

her forever.</p><p>

     During the first month of his marriage, Dudley raved of

his unalloyed bliss to the cynical Tomlinson, who merely

thumped him hard on the back, wishing ardently that it might

continue. Aside he would say to Helen Martin:</p><p>

     &ldquo;What's the use? He can't see he's living in a fool's

paradise.&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Helen would demand somewhat impatiently, &ldquo;she is

all and more than we could have hoped.&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; said Tomlinson, the raven, &ldquo;I have lived long

in the East. The pagan must out!&rdquo;</p><p>

     Although he disapproved of his wife's habit of rising

with the sun, Dudley awoke one morning very early. The

glorious sunshine of Japan had forced its way in a golden

stream through the closed shutters into the room. At an open

shoji<ref target="n2">[2]</ref> he saw his wife almost before he was fully awake. She

was sitting, with her back to him, on the floor. Before her

was a little black lacquer box, its wide-open lid showing

the shining surface of inlaid mirror. Over it her head was

bending and her hands were very busy.</p><p>

     Dudley got out of bed noiselessly, thinking to startle

her by coming on her of a sudden and catching her in his

arms. But as he came closer to her he became at first

interested, then mystified, and finally horrified at her

strange occupation. She was smearing big blotches of red

paint on her cheeks and lips. That done, she penciled her

eyebrows in the finest lines. Finally she began doing

something to her teeth.</p><p>

     Watching her in almost a fascinated silence, Dudley

remained transfixed. When she had finished, the keenest eye

could hardly have detected the make-up, he thought, so

artfully had she laid it on.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Moonshine!&rdquo; he called to her sharply.</p><p>

     She started, truly, but from surprise rather than

guilt. She even sprang up joyfully, running to meet him,

with her small hands outstretched to his. He held her off.</p><p>

     &ldquo;I can't kiss you with that stuff on your face,&rdquo; he

said sternly.</p><p>

     Her long, yellow eyes grew large in bewilderment.</p><p>

     &ldquo;You kinnod kees me?&rdquo; she said slowly. &ldquo;Why, my lord?&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;With that&mdash;that paint on your face! How can you ask?&rdquo;

     She smiled.</p><p>

     He observed something else which alarmed him more than

before.</p><p>

     &ldquo;What have you done to your teeth?&rdquo; he demanded.</p><p>

     She parted her lips just a trifle. The little straight

row of pearly teeth was stained hideously in some brown dye.</p><p>

     She essayed a little laugh of wonder and remonstrance.</p><p>

     &ldquo;O, dear my lord,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I nod any longer thad

liddle bit maiden. I nize married leddy now&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;Will that come off?&rdquo;</p><p>

     Dudley pointed with a shaking finger to her teeth.</p><p>

     She nodded, her troubled eyes still seeking his for

explanation.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Take it off&mdash;and all the rest!&rdquo; he shouted at her in

such a big thundering voice that she began to tremble.</p><p>

     &ldquo;You doan like me do&mdash;&rdquo; she began.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Don't like!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Do you think I want my wife

to be a painted&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;You doan desire,&rdquo; she began slowly, still past

understanding.</p><p>

     Dudley began to have a conception of her viewpoint. To

this she had doubtless been educated and <orig reg="accustomed">accus-



<pb n="419"/>



tomed</orig> all her life. He must effect the cure, gently but

firmly.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Moonshine, I ask you to take all that stain off your

teeth.&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;Yeas&mdash;yeas,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;I doan keer put thad on&mdash;no,

I doan keer thad I married leddy or nod; only all my

honorable ancestors&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is a custom of your race. But

you are married now to an American, remember. Women of my

country don't disfigure themselves in that way. Come&mdash;off

with it.&rdquo; He led her to the wash-basin.</p><p>

     She removed the stain from her teeth readily and

willingly enough, and she rubbed with a little sponge the

black lines above her eyes; but she stopped at taking off

the paint, begging and coaxing to be excused from such

humiliation. She could not bear to have him see her without

what seemed to her one of the chief perquisites of her

beauty.</p><p>

     But he was inexorable, and stood over her peremptorily,

as with trembling hands and tearful eyes she rubbed her

cheeks.</p><p>

     When she had quite finished, he held her at arm's

length and looked at her. He marveled that she should

attempt to spoil her natural delicate loveliness with such

hideous cosmetics.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I love you again. You must never

disfigure yourself in that way.&rdquo;</p><p>

     Delighted to discover that she was far prettier without

the make-up on her face, the depression her use of the

cosmetics caused him rapidly vanished. He even joked and

teased her about it as he dressed himself.</p><p>

     She sat on the floor, leaning her head languidly

against the foot of the bed. Somehow, despite the chairs and

couches about their rooms, she seemed to slip naturally to

her little crouched up position on the floor, and her

husband could find no fault with this little pagan habit,

for she looked so quaint and pretty.</p><p>

     As he talked, her eyes were downcast, and he noted with

pleasure how long and silky were the lashes that shadowed

them. She appeared to be all attention, listening to him

politely. Suddenly she put a question to him:</p><p>

     &ldquo;Dear my lord, you doan will condescend to kees me eef

I puttin' thad honorable paint on my insignificant, homely

countenance?&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; said her husband with Western

decisiveness.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Eef,&rdquo; said she, argumentatively, &ldquo;you, my lord, an' me

your honorable insignificant wife go out on street togedder,

will you also kees me there whicheven?&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;Of course not. American men don't do such things in

public, much as they may revel in it in private.&rdquo;</p><p>

     He was using the military brushes to his smooth brown

hair, smiling at her tenderly the while.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;therefore I only puttin' thad

honorable paint on my honorable face wen I goin' out on

street. Then you 'scuse yourself to nod kees me, account

thad augustly unpoliteness for American gendleman. I doan

keer then. You kinnod do. Therefore I wear thad honorable

paint,&rdquo; she explained triumphantly.</p><p>

     &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said her husband, one hand pausing with a brush

halfway to his head. &ldquo;You mean you'd put that paint on when

we go out?&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;And take it off, my lord, wen you desire kees me,&rdquo; she

finished for him.</p><p>

     Dudley threw his brushes down on the bed and burst out

laughing. She was really irresistable, he thought. But, of

course, she must be converted. He sat down beside her on the

floor.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Listen, Mrs. Dudley,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you swore to honor and

obey me, did you not?&rdquo;</p><p>

     She inclined her head.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I order you to destroy or throw

away every scrap of that make-up stuff. You'll do it?&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;I will destroy all thad honorable beautiful stuff, my

lord,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>

     A few of his friends remarked that the bride's vivid

color had faded to a beautiful pink flush, to which Dudley

replied with a glance at his wife, that she could not be

said to lack color.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Of course, Mrs. Dudley isn't pale; but then she had

such a phenomenally gorgeous complexion before,&rdquo; drawled

Tomlinson, with what seemed to the



<pb n="420"/>



truth-knowing Dudley, veiled meaning. However, he was

indifferent to comment. He knew that her appearance had

changed for the better, but he wondered that she should

still have so much color, for he remembered how on that

first day her skin had been peculiarly clear and creamy when

she had washed the paint off it, with scarcely a tinge of

color.</p><p>

     A few days later, when she had dressed hurriedly to go

with him to an entertainment at the American Consulate, he

noticed a little red blotch on her nose.</p><p>

     &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; he inquired suspiciously, and he led

her before a long mirror.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Thad!&rdquo; Her eyes flickered guiltily. &ldquo;I jus' scratch my

honorable nose liddle bit,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>

     He took his handkerchief out and rubbed the spot,

despite her protests. Then he looked at the piece of linen

in his hand. It was stained in blurred red. Her honoroable

nose was free of its scratch.</p><p>

     Without a word he led her back to their rooms. Holding

her face over a basin he washed it clean with a wet towel

end. After the flush resulting from his brisk motion had

died down, he found she was quite pale.</p><p>

     &ldquo;It is not,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so much the fact that you have

disobeyed me, but that you have deceived and lied to me.

Where is that paint box?&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;I dinnod lie to you,&rdquo; she denied with a burst of

passion, &ldquo;I destroy thad same honorable box. I buy

altogedder new pot of paint, jus' nize liddle light paint

this-a-time.&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;Get me it,&rdquo; he ordered. He was quite angry this time,

and she dared not disobey him. The contents of the box he

emptied into the fireplace. Then he smashed the box.</p><p>

     &ldquo;I don't expect to find any more of that stuff around

these rooms; do you understand?&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;Yeas, my lord,&rdquo; she said, in such a small, humble

voice that his anger melted completely.</p><p>

     He sat down and took her on his knee.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Little one, you will not use that stuff if I tell you

it pains me for you to do so, will you? Try and see things

as I do. Anything that is artificial is wrong, disgusting.

In America only women of a certain shunned type use paint,

or silly superficial women whose vanity is their sap of

life. I cannot bear to have my wife do so. Don't Moonshine,

don't.&rdquo;</p><p>

     She began to sob piteously.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Aeverybody goin' mek laugh ad me eef I doan did so.&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;Nonsense; no, they won't,&rdquo; he consoled her.</p><p>

     &ldquo;I loog so ole an' oogly this away.&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;You look younger and prettier and fresher and sweeter

in every way,&rdquo; he assured her eagerly.</p><p>

     For a few days following, her manifest unhappiness

communicated itself to Dudley. His love made him quickly

conscious of and responsive to her moods. She had been of a

naturally exuberant and buoyant disposition; but now she

became quiet and passive, a shadow loitering constantly in

her troubled eyes. She went with him reluctantly, and often

would plead weariness or illness in order to be excused from

leaving her rooms.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; thought her husband patiently, &ldquo;it is

natural for the poor little thing to feel badly about it at

first, but she will get used to it. She must.&rdquo;</p><p>

     Moonshine brooded over her unhappiness. Despite the

fact that she really loved the stranger she had married with

all the force of her passionate nature, nevertheless the

customs of her people were strongly implanted in her nature.

She could not feel at home among the people with whom she

now associated and who were almost altogether of her

husband's nationality. They were kindly and beautiful, she

admitted, but she resented their good-natured and humorous

encouragement of her efforts to dress and act like them.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she would argue inwardly, &ldquo;should she continue

this struggle when all her efforts made her seem only the

more a stranger among them, a guest as it were? And why

should she be placed under this restraint and denied that

which a Japanese husband

<pb n="422"/>

would have purchased for her? It was all very hard and

bitter. She tortured herself with the thought that with the

loss of her pot of paint her beauty departed also. She could

not imagine Japanese feminine beauty without the lurking

presence of a magic toilet box. Of course her honorable

husband would continue to praise her face, but that was only

natural. He did not wish to pain her by letting her know the

truth. In this she judged him from a purely Japanese

standpoint. A Japanese husband, she knew, would continue to

assure his wife that she was beautiful, even long after she

had become an ancestor (grandmother).</p><p>

     Then Moonshine conceived a plot by which she would put

her beauty to the test. Gowning herself in an exquisite dove-

colored kimono, tied about with a lavender obi, with a

little purple parasol shading her bare head, the hair of

which was dressed after the prevailing Japanese fashion, and

being careful to put no paint or powder whatever on her

face, she went down to that quarter of Nagasaki where she

had previously lived, hoping to encounter some of her old

friends, who would surely enlighten her as to the truth.</p><p>

     She had excused herself from accompanying her husband

on a little business trip by wrapping her head up in wet

linen in the morning and pleading a violent headache.</p><p>

     At first, when Moonshine left the hotel, her guilty

heart beat rapidly with the excitement and fear of her

proposed scheme. She felt like a naughty child running away

from home. But gradually, as the flying feet of her runner

put a great distance between her and the hotel the fear

vanished from her; she even forgot the fact that she had

come out in Japanese attire and with her face untouched by

any beauty save that of nature. A sense of delight possessed

her as they neared the old familiar quarter of the town

where she had spent nearly her entire life. She smiled with

delight over her stolen holiday.</p><p>

     In a little street, gay with painted signboards and

posters and quaint goods displayed in front of shops,

Moonshine alighted from her jinrikisha<ref target="n3">[3]</ref>, and bidding her man

not to lose sight of her, she started down the street,

stopping at several stores to make small purchases for

herself. She was bending over a silk merchant's counter,

examining the quality of a rich obi<ref target="n4">[4]</ref>, when the titter of

familiar, silvery laughter caused her to look up.</p><p>

     Two young Japanese girls were standing near her, their

little almond eyes sparking with fun over the tops of their

fans, and undisguisedly and openly laughing at the pale

Moonshine.</p><p>

     The girl took a couple of little steps toward them,

opening her own little fan with a whirl.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Ah, good morning, Perfume and Spring,&rdquo; she said in

soft Japanese. &ldquo;Pray, is your honorable health good?&rdquo;</p><p>

     The girls giggled, but answered with seeming

politeness.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Good morning, Madame Moonshine. Yes, our honorable

health is good. And yours?&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;Honorably excellent,&rdquo; said Moonshine, with a piteous

look of entreaty as the two girls again lapsed into

tittering. &ldquo;Why do you indulge in the honorable laugh, dear

my friends?&rdquo; she inquired with unfeigned anxiety, for she

feared she had lost forever all her friends and earned their

ridicule by her marriage to the foreigner.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Oh, Moonshine&mdash;he-he-he-he,&rdquo; said Perfume, &ldquo;you do

look so honorably ridiculous.&rdquo;</p><p>

     Moonshine grew paler.</p><p>

     &ldquo;He-he-he&mdash;&rdquo; giggled Spring. &ldquo;Oh, Moonshine, has some

honorably wicked fiend or demon struck your august face?&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;My face!&rdquo; faltered Moonshine, unconsciously putting up

her little trembling hands to it, and then all in a moment

understanding. &ldquo;Ah-h!&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;you think me&mdash;a little

bit ugly, maybe?&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;Honorably hideous,&rdquo; said Perfume, spitefully, and

Spring's laughter rang shrill.</p><p>

     Moonshine looked at them a moment without speaking. One

of her packages fell from her hand to the

<pb n="423"/>

floor. She stooped and picked it up mechanically, placing it

in the sleeve of her kimono. Then she turned about slowly.

In a half-dazed fashion she held her hand up to her runner,

who had followed her obediently with the vehicle.</p><p>

     The girls laughed vehemently now.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Ah bah! (good bye) honorable ghost!&rdquo; they called after

her.</p><p>

     That night when her husband returned, he found her

sitting in the dark waiting for him. A great wan moon had

stolen high in the heavens and one sheer, silvery beam came

into the open window and loitered upon the white face of his

wife. It was ghastly in its pallor, for she had been

suffering many hours.</p><p>

     To his extreme horror, she crept on her knees to him,

and, putting her head at his feet, began a piteous

supplication for his honorable permission to purchase a

little pot of paint.</p><p>

     He raised her to her feet, and drawing her into his

arms, tried to hush the sobs that had welled up from her

little overcharged heart.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Don't cry like that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can't bear it. You

are breaking my heart. Oh, why do you let such a foolish

trifle distress you and come between us?&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;Pray, pray, my lord, allow me this liddle bit favor.&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;Oh, this is quite foolish of you, Moonshine.&rdquo;</p><p>

     That night her sobbing slumber troubled him so he lay

awake. Then he made a blunder. He advised her to notice how

the American women of the finer class scorned the use of

such cosmetics. In particular he held up Miss Helen Martin

as a sample.</p><p>

     He could not have said anything that would so quickly

have offended the supersensitive girl. She had acquired an

extraordinary aversion for the American girl, despite the

fact that Miss Martin had sought her out and tried in every

way to be kindly and friendly. Without the slightest cause,

Moonshine was positive that in Miss Martin she had a rival,

one who apparently could not conceal her feeling for Dudley,

and one whom she knew her husband absolutely admired and

respected.</p><p>

     When Dudley had gone to the American Consulate for his

mail, as was his morning custom, Moonshine drew from a

hiding place her last remaining pot of paint. She thought of

the pale American girl with hatred, as she rubbed the paint

violently into her skin.</p><p>

     Just at this time, Dudley was reading a letter from his

mother.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Bring her home to us, my son. Helen has told us so

much of her lovely personality, and I cannot tell you what

joy it gives us to know that at least she is a Christian.

Our grandchild must be born and christened here in America,

by all means.&rdquo;</p><p>

     He came back to Moonshine joyously. As she confronted

him at the threshold with her shining, defiant eyes and

painted cheeks, he staggered.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Why you doan marry thad Miss Helen Martin, my

honorable lord?&rdquo; she queried.</p><p>

     After that, recognizing the impossibility of taking her

to his mother, Dudley rented a little house in a suburb

close to the city, where he installed Moonshine. His love

had deepened to an all-absorbing tenderness and pity that

was touching. It was with the utmost patience that he

continued the struggle against the paint nightmare that had

now taken up its abode permanently with them, for despite

her spasmodic washings pure of her face, he knew that she

never was without it in the house.</p><p>

     Autumn had crept upon the land with stealing step. A

melancholy sweetness pervaded hill and dale. The flowers

were turning to the hue of the golden brown leaves, which in

their turn reflected the colors of the dying sunset, when

Moonshine awakened in the night and piercingly called for

her mother. The old nurse that attended her refused to leave

her side, and Dudley started out in the night, shaken with a

great premonition of disaster and a vain hope to gratify the

wish of the sick girl to have her mother once more with her.</p><p>

     On his way back, sick with the <orig reg="fruitlessness">fruit-

lessness</orig> of his mission, for her people had been politely

obdurate, his Japanese valet, who had come to meet him,

flung himself at his feet, and after bitter tears and

lamentations told him of the death of his wife hardly an

hour after his departure, and of the birth of an honorable

man-child.</p><p>

     Crazed and distracted with the horror of the tragedy

that had come upon him, Dudley rushed to the hotel where

they had previously lived, and where still abided a few of

his friends. There, like one bereft of all hope on earth, he

flung himself into Tomlinson's apartments. Tomlinson

promptly sent for Helen Martin. After vainly trying to

comfort the bereft man, they finally succeeded in prevailing

on him to return to the little house which had so lately

held his happiness.</p><p>

     The place was dimly lighted by dull andons<ref target="n5">[5]</ref> and

horribly silent when they reached it. Their own footsteps

rang out hollow and ghostly as they crossed the zashishi<ref target="n6">[6]</ref>

and ascended the thin little stairway.</p><p>

     Her nurse had dressed Moonshine in all the white

deathrobes of a Japanese girl. Trembling like one afflicted

with ague, the husband bent over her still form, great beads

of perspiration standing out on his own brow. Slowly, and

with shaking hand, he took the white cloth from Moonshine's

face.</p><p>

     Miss Martin started back with an exclamation of horror.</p><p>

     &ldquo;Oh-h!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we must wash all that hideous paint

off. She must be buried as a Christian.&rdquo;</p><p>

     &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Dudley, softly, &ldquo;leave it on.&rdquo;</p>
