Lighton, William R.  "Omaha, the Prairie City."  <hi rend="italic">Atlantic 
Monthly</hi> 89 (1902): 545-554.</head>

<lg type="poem">
<l>     "Rare are the buttons on a Roman's breeches,</l> 
<l>     In antiquarian eyes surpassing riches:</l> 
<l>     Rare is each crack'd, black, rotten earthen dish,</l> 
<l>     That held of ancient Rome the flesh and fish."</l> 
</lg> 

<p>THUS wrote Peter Pindar; and Dr. Holmes, in kindred mood, said 
that "fifty years make everything hopelessly old-fashioned, without 
giving it the charm of real antiquity.  There are too many 
talkative old people who remember all about that time; and at best 
half a century is a half-baked bit of ware." 
</p><p>It was a little chilling to have memory thrust forward those 
sayings at the moment of starting to write about Omaha, which is a 
half-century town.  But memory furnished also a remedy for the 
chill, in the observation of Bacon, that "a Man that is young in 
Yeares, may be Old in Houres, if he have lost no Time."  Omaha has 
lost no time.  In the first part of the year 1854 there was not the 
first premonitory symptom of a town; now there is a city of more 
than one hundred thousand inhabitants, and within a radius of ten 
miles the people number nearly a quarter of a million.  If we 
measure by the scale of contrasts, we may well say that the city 
had its beginning in a remote antiquity. 
</p><p>It is doubtful when white men first set foot upon this soil.  
In 1673 Father Marquette accurately mapped the confluence of the 
Platte and Missouri rivers; but his map was drawn "upon information 
and belief," as the lawyers say.  He got his data from the Indians.  
Probably the earliest authentic map of this region to be drawn from 
actual knowledge was that made by Lewis and Clark, who were here in 
1804.  But long before the coming of Lewis and Clark the skirmish 
line of civilization had passed the mouth of the Platte, and moved 
on into the northwestern wilderness.  The skirmishers made a motley 
crowd, of mixed motives and interests, &mdash; Jesuit missionaries, 
hunters, trappers, agents of the fur companies, Indian traders, and 
on down the scale to mere restless-footed adventurers.  Some 
wandering Frenchmen had entered the Missouri country by way of 
Canada and the Great Lakes; they had formed trading compacts with 
many of the Indian tribes, and some had entered into conjugal 
misalliances with Indian women.  The effects of those unions can be 
traced to this day, if one cares to take the trouble.  In Astoria 
Irving tells of one Dorion, who had associated himself more or less 
intimately with several bands, and who had as his "habitual wife" 
a Sioux squaw.  That was not an exceptional case; there were many 
like Dorion, although few left legible records of their doings. 
</p><p>The Canadian French formed but a part of the pioneer 
stragglers.  it is probable that the Missouri itself was the main-traveled avenue of that early incursion; for the waterway offered 
the easiest approach to the country, and also the easiest means for 
carrying away the plunder of traffic.  More than a century ago, the 
American Fur Company, whose headquarters were at St. Louis, 
established trading posts at many places upon the Upper Missouri.  
But these were not towns in any sense of the word.  That was not a 
time for town-building. 
</p><p>It was the gold excitement of 1849 that first brought the 
whites to this part of the West in considerable numbers, and 
resulted in the planting of the first permanent settlements.  The 
lands beyond the Missouri were then in possession of the Indians, 
and the only right the whites enjoyed was to pass peacefully over 
the trail that led up the valley of the Platte.  But Iowa had been 
ceded to civilization, and upon the eastern bank of the Missouri 
there grew 
<pb n="546"/>  
up a few rudimentary towns that were engaged in 
"outfitting" the gold hunters for their trip across the plains.  
Amongst all such seats of traffic there was hot rivalry for 
preeminence.  In this neighborhood the most successful in that 
struggle was the place first known as Kanesville, which was 
afterward absorbed into the present city of Council Bluffs, 
directly opposite Omaha.  After a little time Kanesville became the 
metropolis of the Salt Lake trail, and attracted to itself a great 
host of adventurers of all sorts, &mdash; just the kind of populace that 
is now swarming in the camps and towns that supply the Klondike and 
the Cape Nome country.  Every mother's son was in quest of sudden 
and great wealth. 
</p><p>But they were not all men of the moment, content with the 
moment's opportunities.  Some were mindful of the time when the 
broad prairies beyond the river would be opened for settlement, and 
when Fortune would strike into a swifter pace.  Men of that stripe 
will always feel themselves handicapped by even a fictitious 
limitation upon their activity.  The men of Kanesville chafed under 
the law which kept them from Nebraska soil.  That restriction was 
soon removed.  The Kansas-Nebraska Bill was signed by Franklin 
Pierce on May 30, 1854.  The more enterprising ones of Council 
Bluffs had surreptitiously "located" a town site on the new soil 
many months in advance of authority; that is, they had selected a 
likely place, and were awaiting only the conclusion of formalities 
before taking open possession.  The date fixed for the incoming of 
settlers was early in July, 1854, and the freshly glorified Fourth 
was celebrated in the new-made Omaha City. 
</p><p>There were strong differences between the motives of the 
Kansans and the Nebraskans.  The opening of Kansas put the nation 
into a passion; the opening of Nebraska did little more than to 
stimulate commercial activity.  Kansas stood for a conflict of 
ideas and for a conquest by blood; Nebraska stood for an every-day 
sort of neighborliness, for peaceful settlement and home-making, 
and for a conquest by simple business sagacity.  Yet the beginning 
of Nebraska was picturesque in the extreme, with rose-hued romance 
and dun-colored actuality inextricably intertwined.  Not a foot of 
railroad had been built in Iowa, and there was no communication 
with the world save as wagon trains or horsemen came straggling 
over the Iowa trails, or as the half-tramp boats struggled up the 
uncertain river from St. Louis.  The new land was then more remote 
than is any part of our nation to-day; yet the people lacked 
nothing that would make them equal to their life.  It was a society 
sufficient unto itself, having its own localized ideas and purposes 
and its own mode for working out its salvation.  Closer proximity 
to the established institutions of civilization would hardly have 
helped the movement; it would have been more likely to hinder, by 
damping the frank ingenuousness of the impulse.  Nebraska was very 
well off in those days, although the people did some unwise and 
even grotesque things.  The first of all matters to engage their 
attention was the building of a legion of towns.  Wherever a 
ferryboat touched the western bank of the stream it made the soil 
pregnant, and there a town quickened. 
</p><p>Towns, no less than states or nations, must have some reason 
for being; the birth of a hamlet is no more fortuitous than the 
birth of an empire.  Nevertheless, it is hard to give a just reason 
for the beginning of Omaha.  There seems to be but one word for 
it, &mdash; the overworked American word "enterprise."  Other towns &mdash; many 
Western towns &mdash; have sprung from an exalted thought, and been 
nourished by the blood of sacrifice.  Omaha had no such experience.  
The mother of Omaha was Expediency; among its founders there were 
no martyrs to a great social cause, but there 
<pb n="547"/>  
was a good 
general average of manly honor and faithfulness to the plain duties 
of every day; the settlement was not led by eminent captains of 
industry or commerce, but the rank and file of the settlers held 
many clear-sighted, stout-hearted traders and workers.  Omaha owed 
its establishment, as it has owed the best of its later growth to 
the multiplication of the simple arts of peace and to a commonalty 
of well-being.  It was a beginning almost commonplace, &mdash; almost, but 
not quite.  The element of romance averted commonplaceness.  From 
an early history I quote this description of the first house that 
was built here: &mdash;  
</p><p>"The house was of round logs, and stood on the corner of 
Jackson and Twelfth streets.  It was intended for a town house, and 
being the general headquarters for a time, was known under the name 
of the 'St. Nicholas.'  Here those who had claims would congregate 
in the evenings; cook their bacon, corn bread, and coffee in the 
centre of the room, where a portion of the puncheon floor had been 
removed for a fireplace, and sing songs and pass away the evening.  
Later, one Johnson pitched a tent on the corner of Cass and 
Thirteenth streets, which was in time supplanted by a sod-and-board 
shanty, that was named the 'Big Six,' where the first saloon was 
established, to which the town-house men would often pay a visit, 
wading through grass knee-deep." 
</p><p>Omaha was already claiming a population of hundreds; but those 
hundreds were actually living in Council Bluffs, awaiting the time 
when walls and roofs could be built.  Before the town had any real 
existence a postmaster was appointed; and when it was but three 
weeks old, and while the postmaster was carrying the mail about 
with him in the crown of his hat, a newspaper was established!  
Twelve issues make a complete file of that baby newspaper.  I quote 
from the initial editorial: &mdash;  
</p><p>"Well, strangers, friends, patrons, and good people generally, 
wherever in the wide world your lot may be cast, here we are upon 
Nebraska soil, seated upon the stump of an ancient oak, which 
serves for an editorial chair, and with the top of our badly abused 
beaver hat for a table, we propose inditing a leader for the Omaha 
Arrow. . . .  There sticks our axe in the trunk of an old oak whose 
branches have for years been fanned by the breezes that constantly 
sweep from over the ofttimes flower-dotted prairie lea, and from 
which we propose making a log for our cabin. . . .  The pioneering 
squatter and the uncivilized red men are our constituents and 
neighbors, the wolves and deer our traveling companions, and the 
wild birds and prairie winds our musicians. . . . 
</p><p>"Last night we slept in our sanctum, the starry-decked heaven 
for a ceiling, and our mother earth for a floor.  It was a glorious 
night, and we were tired from the day's exertions.  Far away on 
different portions of the prairie glimmered the camp fires of our 
neighbors, the Pawnees, Omahas, or that noble and too often 
unappreciated class of our people known as pioneers or squatters.  
We gathered around our little camp fire, talked of times in the 
past, of the pleasing present, and of the glorious future which the 
march of civilization should open in the land whereon we sat. . . 
.  Behind us was spread our buffalo robe in an old Indian trail, 
which was to serve as our bed.  The cool night wind swept in 
cooling breezes around us, deep-laden with the perfume of a 
thousand-hued and various flowers.  Far away upon our lee came the 
occasional long-drawn howl of the prairie wolves.  Talk of comfort!  
There was more of it in one hour of our sanctum camp life upon 
Nebraska soil than in a whole life of fashionable pampered world in 
the settlements." 
</p><p>Neither in the town nor in the territory had government taken 
form; the 
<pb n="548"/>  
citizens were administering their affairs in 
something like committee of the whole; yet life was fairly orderly 
and decent, simply because the people wished to have it so. 
</p><p>A governor was appointed for the territory, but he did not 
arrive upon the scene until October.  Then he stopped at Bellevue, 
a town twelve miles below Omaha, meaning to make that place the 
seat of the territorial government; but he died three weeks later, 
and the territorial secretary, who became acting governor, brought 
the capital to Omaha, where it remained until 1867, when Nebraska 
was admitted to statehood.  At the first session of the legislature 
the question of the permanent location of the capital aroused no 
little bitterness.  Every town upon the new soil was clamorous to 
be chosen.  "The excitement was very great at times," wrote an 
early historian.  "The lobbies were once crowded with the 
respective parties to the contest, armed with bludgeons, brickbats, 
and pistols.  A fight was thought to be imminent, but it did not 
occur. . . .  The elections were eminently farcical, owing to the 
fact that many districts where white men had never slept more than 
one night were represented by members who talked loudly of their 
'constituents.'" 
</p><p>At some time in the winter of 1854-55 the dead governor was 
succeeded by an appointee from Arkansas, one Mark W. Izard.  Here 
is the story of the inaugural ball: &mdash;  
</p><p>"The rooms had a single coat of what was then called 
plastering, composed of frozen mud, and a very thin coating at 
that.  The floor was rough and unplaned, and had been energetically 
scrubbed for the occasion; but the night being dreadfully cold, and 
the heating apparatus failing to warm the room, the water froze 
upon the floor and could not be melted.  Rough cottonwood boards on 
either side of the room were substitutes for chairs. 
</p><p>"The hour of seven having arrived, the grand company began to 
assemble.  Long before the appointed hour his Arkansas Excellency 
appeared in the dancing hall. . . .  Izard was the guest of nine 
ladies, who were all that could be mustered, even for a state 
occasion, in Omaha.  Two of the ladies could not dance, and their 
places were supplied by gentlemen. . . .  Jim Orton was the 
solitary fiddler, occupying the corner of the room. . . .  The 
supper came off about midnight, and consisted of coffee with brown 
sugar, but no milk, sandwiches of a peculiar size, very thick, and 
made up of a singular mixture of bread of radical complexion, and 
bacon.  This menu was supplemented with dried-apple pie; and there 
being no tables in those days, it was 'passed around.'  The 
governor, being from a warmer climate, stood around shivering with 
the cold, but bore himself with amiable fortitude, buoyed up by the 
honors thus showered upon him; and at the proper time, under a deep 
sense of his own consequence, made a speech returning thanks for 
the high honors done him." 
</p><p>Such was the beginning.  In July, 1855, Omaha had about 200 
residents; in 1857 this number had increased to about 1800, and 
then, for the first time an orderly government by statutes and law 
officers was put into effect.  It was not until the latter year 
that any consistent attempt was made to develop the outlying farm 
lands.  A land office was then established; before that time it had 
been impossible for a settler to get title to his acres.  After 
those three formless years there was organization and the beginning 
of progress.  Churches and schools were built; there was a public 
library of 4000 volumes, and a citizens' association provided a 
course of ten lectures for the benefit of a library fund; the 
federal government was erecting a substantial building, to cost 
$100,000; $50,000 had been expended in constructing a military road 
to connect Omaha 
<pb n="549"/>  
with Fort Kearney, and there was an 
appropriation of $400,000 for building a wagon road to South Pass 
that was to place the town in commercial communication with the 
great West.  All this in three years. 
</p><p>The panic of 1857 affected the newer districts no less than 
the old, &mdash; not by wrecking fortunes already amassed, but by 
retarding development.  One of the most serious effects was in the 
delay of railroad-building.  Beginning with the work of Fremont, 
numberless surveys had been made for a Pacific railway, and 
numberless construction companies had been organized for carrying 
on the work.  National aid was for a long time denied, and the 
building of the Union Pacific was not begun until 1863.  The road 
was completed in May, 1869; and in the meantime three great railway 
systems had extended their lines across Iowa.  That was the 
beginning of modern Omaha, as it was the beginning of the modern 
West.  From that time to the present, material progress has 
suffered no serious checks but such as have been imposed by the 
erratic moods of the people themselves. 
</p><p>Omaha stands for the life of the prairies, to which it owes 
its own life; its past and future must be read not alone in the 
temper and inclinations of its own corporate citizens, but also in 
the motives of the men who have been engaged in turning the wild 
prairies into farms and gardens.  For the purpose of measurement 
and valuation it must not be isolated; it must be considered as 
merely an integral part of the middle Missouri country.  It is not 
a cosmopolitan city, &mdash; in the nature of things it cannot be; at its 
greatest and best it must be and remain a farm town, with all that 
that implies.  Consider that within a circle of seven hundred miles 
or more in diameter, with Omaha as the centre, there is practically 
no source of wealth save in crops and herds.  No country hamlet of 
the region is more truly the creature of the farms.  Those partial 
disasters which the city has experienced have resulted from its 
failure to see or to acknowledge its dependence.  The people have 
nursed some leaping ambitions, and have tried to ignore the 
inevitable; but they have had to pay the price down to the last 
decimal. 
</p><p>Readers will remember that in the years from 1885 to 1890 the 
middle West was in travail with a "boom."  Both city and country 
were involved, but in different degrees.  In its relation to the 
farm lands the boom was little more than a passing delusion; in 
very many towns and cities it amounted to a frenzy of false views 
and attitudes.  The people of Omaha then fancied that they could 
read clear their title to a vague immensity, and adopted a course 
of behavior that has flavored every succeeding year with 
bitterness.  The corporate limits of the town were greatly 
enlarged, and the surrounding prairies broke out in a rash of 
pretentious "additions."  Quiet cornfields that lay ten miles from 
the heart of things were surveyed and platted into town lots, which 
were sold for a hundred times their real value.  It does not appear 
that any one was willing to show disloyalty to his fellows by 
questioning the future; and so the process of booming was continued 
until the frenzy was spent by its own force.  Of course there was 
no good reason for such conduct, &mdash; no shadow of reason save in an 
ill-considered desire for an unearned greatness.</p> 
 
<l>                              "We may outrun,</l> 
<l>     By violent swiftness, that which we run at,</l> 
<l>     And lose by over running."</l> 
 
<p>That proved to be exactly true in the case of Omaha.  It outran 
sober judgment, sound sense, and all the virtues of that old-fashioned class, until there was real danger that it would be "like 
a candle ill made, that smothers the splendor of a happy fortune in 
its own grease."  The boom did not consist only in inflation of 
real estate values; it went 
<pb n="550"/>  
much farther.  There was a 
craze for wholesale inflation; most of all, a craze for a big 
population.  As other places have thought, so thought Omaha, that 
if only enough people came in there would be a great city.  
Thousands of people and millions of money were sucked into that 
maelstrom of insanity.  But means of support cannot be provided by 
mere enthusiasm, however honest.  The city of Omaha makes its 
living only as a sort of corporate middleman for the tenants of the 
tributary farms; and as this business is limited to a certain 
volume, its profits will not support an unlimited number, no matter 
how loudly the ambitious people may whoop about it.  Omaha wanted 
to grow, regardless of the farms, and so grew beyond the true 
measure of its usefulness and power; then when it got back its 
consciousness it had to sit down in wretched idleness, while 
waiting for the undeveloped farms to catch up. 
</p><p>But the boasted growth was not all <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi>.  The census 
of 1890 showed a population of 140,000, while the census of 1900 
shows but 103,000.  The plain truth is that the returns of 1890 
were "padded," probably for political ends.  Padding was the key to 
the mood of the time.  In 1890 Omaha really had 85,000 or 90,000 
people.  When the announcement for 1900 was made, the citizens were 
a little dismayed for a day or two; but now they are quite 
complacently congratulating themselves that every one knew the 
earlier figures to be a lie! 
</p><p>In fact, within the latter half of the past decade Omaha has 
had a substantial growth in population, in industrial activity, and 
in wealth.  Here are the figures, got from authoritative sources: &mdash; </p>

</list> 
<p>These figures give an accurate index to what has been achieved in 
Omaha; but their greatest value is in indicating (what is far more 
important) the growth of the prairies that make Omaha. 
</p><p>The saddest and most disastrous of all the effects of the boom 
was in inciting a majority of the middle Western cities of 
metropolitan pretensions to inaugurate a system of municipal 
government that was much too large for the work necessary to be 
done.  In this respect Omaha suffered more than most of her sister 
cities.  As a matter of good common sense, Omaha needed no 
elaborate scheme of government.  It was nothing but an overgrown 
country town; its people were pastoral, and really wanted nothing 
better than to have their town's affairs administered according to 
the dictates of pastoral prudence and thrift.  But one city set the 
example of overdoing, and the rest jealously followed; and now the 
people have on their hands a political "machine" as burdensome as 
a large family of white elephants.  There is not enough to give the 
machine legitimate occupation; so it has turned its attention to 
the illegitimate, and the people are suffering from "ring 
politics," bossism, and all the evils of that breed, on down to 
official corruption.  It began with the boom, but no one knows 
where it will end.</p> 
 
<l>"Had doting Priam checked his son's desire,</l> 
<l>Troy had been bright with fame, and not with 
	fire."</l> 
 
<p>Surely no good citizen should decry a wise devotion to the 
problems of good government; but here is a tendency to

be 
passionately enamored of professional politics in its poorest form.  
La Bruyere said that "there is what is called the highway to posts 
and honors, and there is a cross-and by-way, which is much the 
shortest."  That "cross-and by-way" has been the favored route out 
here.  The functions of public officers have been debased from 
lawgiving, in its true sense, to mere lawmaking; machine-made, 
"hand-me-down" laws are usurping the place of plain, honest rules 
of action, and the government of the city has been carried to the 
point of making it a trade, for the profit of the tradesmen in 
power.  Reckless extravagance marked the beginning.  With no need 
for such action, the boundaries of the city were widened to include 
more than twenty-five square miles, and over this area there was 
spread a close network of "improvements," &mdash; grading, paving, 
sewerage, and so forth; and that course was not stopped until the 
people either would not or could not vote any more bonds.  They 
were already saddled with a bonded indebtedness of $5,000,000.  The 
city presents an anomalous appearance to-day: there are entire 
quarter sections of farm lands lying within the corporate limits, 
still planted to crops, while subject to regular and "special" 
municipal taxation.  Many owners of such property have been ruined 
in consequence of this condition; for because of the burden of 
taxes these lands have a lower market value than those lying 
outside the city. 
</p><p>The tax levy for the year 1901 closely approximates the sum of 
$1,250,000 (or say $12 <hi rend="italic">per capita</hi>), which will be expended for 
interest on bonded debt, and for current administrative expenses of 
this overgrown government.  There is no municipal ownership of any 
public utilities; water, gas, electric lighting, and so forth, the 
city buys from franchised companies or corporations, which in turn 
have got their franchises from the machine.  In 1899 there was paid 
for public water rates $90,000, and for street-lighting $80,000.  
The era of franchised corporations brought a new order of political 
evils, and the people have not yet devised means for dealing with 
them.  Recourse to the ballot has accomplished no definite reform.  
The citizens of Omaha have sometimes displayed an almost morbid 
interest in voting, but within the past ten years they have not 
often succeeded in voting aright.  They have lacked clear 
understanding of the situation, and have also lacked able 
leadership in organizing to combat it.  Almost every Western city 
of any considerable size has this difficult problem to solve.  It 
is the price that must be paid for having tried to do too much 
within a little time. 
 
</p><p>Omaha sprawls.  Horizontally it is a great city.  Even the 
chance visitor is impressed at once by the want of cohesion and 
solidity.  It is like the unjointed skeleton of a man, scattered 
over a ten-acre lot: the bones are here, and they are bones of a 
man's size, but they want articulation.  The front of the town 
extends for seven miles along the river, presenting a most ungainly 
aspect, broken and dilapidated, so that it seems to be grinning 
widely at the world with a mouth whose front teeth are missing.  
The city began upon the river bank; but after a little while, when 
it had got its false notions of bigness, it longed to set its mark 
upon the hilltops, five miles away, and then its first work was 
abandoned and suffered to crumble.  That district is now largely 
dedicated to vice; for Omaha feels that if it is to be indeed a 
city, it must indulge all those forms of viciousness which 
contribute to the appearance of cosmopolitanism.  I have talked 
with officers of the city government who seemed to congratulate 
themselves in saying that they had assumed a "liberal" attitude 
toward all manner of social evils. 
</p><p>From its base line upon the Missouri the town has cast itself 
down upon its 
<pb n="552"/>  
belly, stretching out its arms to the utmost 
over miles of territory, crying greedily, "It's mine, &mdash; all mine!"  
But in no true sense has the city possessed its miles.  In 
appearance Omaha is to-day no more than a big aggregation of little 
towns.  Citified dignity and village simplicity rub elbows on every 
street.  Here, on one corner, is a mammoth modern structure of 
stone and steel that cost $1,000,000; and within the adjoining 
block is a row of tottering frame hovels abandoned to the rats.  It 
is in the residence districts that this contrast is most striking.  
Go out upon almost any of the main streets, and you will presently 
come to an unbroken half mile of stately avenue, grown with 
beautiful trees, and lined with a double row of as pretentious 
homes as you can find anywhere.  Before you can fairly catch your 
breath you have passed from that scene into one of utter 
desolation.  The asphalt pavement has given place to deep-rutted 
yellow earth; your feet are treading a rotted wooden sidewalk or a 
beaten dirt path, arched over and all but obstructed by a tangle of 
sunflowers and wild hemp.  You will think you have come to the 
suburbs.  But Omaha has no suburbs save in the heart of the city: 
"improvement" has merely dropped a stitch.  After walking for a 
quarter of a mile through that wilderness of weeds you will come to 
another stretch of proud avenue, with parks and fountains and 
massive mansions.  Between those districts there will likely be 
cultivated cornfields and cabbage patches.  New York could be set 
down upon the ground included within Omaha's boundaries, and would 
hardly lap over the edges. 
</p><p>The outward aspect of Omaha affords a clue to its intellectual 
and moral attitude.  Its life is still rude, almost unformed.  The 
people are very sensitive upon this point.  It is all one's life is 
worth to say that the town lacks culture.  Culture!  What a word 
that is!  Omaha has true-hearted and refined men and women in 
plenty; but, rather strangely, these have not succeeded in uniting 
to form a true-hearted and refined society.  I think the people are 
a little chary of expressing their gentleness and refinement in 
public, for fear of being considered unsophisticated or rural.  
That would be hard to bear; for the town has only very lately 
passed out of its rural days.  Whatever the cause, the open social 
life of the place is concerned with appearances, not with verities; 
it is made up mostly of postures and show; it is continually 
calling attention to itself in a loud voice, after the manner of 
those who are rudely affected, the world over.  There is no new 
thing that lifts above the horizon of "culture" which the people of 
Omaha do not forthwith import, if it promises to be fashionable.  
With all its intense longing to appear cultured, the town succeeds 
only in being up to date.  In fact, Omaha has no strong collective 
social aims; it has no strong aggregate tendencies.  Its life thus 
far has been nothing but a conglomerate of individual desires, and 
there has been no adequate means for bringing these desires to a 
focus.  The city has no public art galleries, no museums, &mdash; nothing 
of that sort; even in architecture no particular ideals have come 
to light.  This condition is a part of the penalty which the town 
has had to pay for the lack of ideals in its foundation.  It was 
begun for no better reason than that its founders saw here 
opportunities for getting rich, and that paucity of thought has 
persisted. 
 
</p><p>Colton argued that "men, by associating in masses, as in camps 
and in cities, improve their talents, but impair their virtues."  
That saying is reduced to its least significance when it is applied 
to a farm town.  An agricultural state, pure and simple, gives to 
its cities economic stability; in a still greater degree do they 
get moral stamina.  Nebraska is preeminently the farming state of 
the Union, and statistics show that she leads 
<pb n="553"/>  
also in the 
social virtues.  Illiteracy is at its lowest, and most of the crime 
relates back to poor, simple Eve and the apple.  On the farm social 
relations are fundamental, and life is correspondingly tranquil.  
This does not imply moral inertia, but a primary estate of sound, 
rational behavior.  A city that is in close relations with such 
surroundings must be influenced thereby.  Omaha has been greatly 
influenced.  The best thing to be said of the place is that beneath 
the false, frothy surface there is a deep and strong current of 
moral integrity.  That this has not made bold show of itself is due 
to lack of inciting occasion.  The people have known no great 
common vicissitudes that should draw them together and test the 
fibre of the common temper.  Should such a trial come, it would be 
met with an amazing strength and power of sacrifice for good ends.  
The life of the prairies has made good men, but has given them no 
especial motive beyond individual eagerness to get on, no 
particular ideal save to possess their strength in peace. 
</p><p>"A nation's character is the sum of its splendid deeds," said 
Clay; and Emerson, in writing of Boston, declared that "a 
community, like a man, is entitled to be judged by its best."  The 
best of Omaha is very good indeed.  If one is inclined to be hasty 
or harsh in judgment, it is well to remember the rule of the humane 
judge, who will temper the severity of his sentence in 
consideration of youth.  Bear in mind that the whole history of 
Omaha is included in the span of forty-eight years; then say 
whether it has done well.  No one who has taken the trouble to get 
into close touch with the people of this magnificent young West can 
entertain a moment's doubt for the future.  The future is in safe 
hands.  When the people get to know what it is that they have to 
do, they will arise and do it; and woe betide him who stands in the 
way of their honest desires.  He must be hardy indeed who would 
undertake to compass them about with the usages of dishonor.  Omaha 
will find the way, and will keep to it. 
</p><p>It would be a mistake to argue that the actual or potential 
greatness of the city is brought within too narrow limits by the 
lack of variety in the resources and activities of the region upon 
which it must draw for the raw materials of its greatness.  The 
domain that is directly tributary to Omaha comprises a large part 
of the future food gardens of the world.  It is idle to try to 
summarize these resources, for they are boundless, and they make 
the most infallible of all sources of wealth and power.  The 
present state of development has hardly served to make a scratch 
upon the outmost cuticle of affairs.  Not the city alone, but the 
whole of the Missouri country as well, is still in a mewling 
industrial infancy: not in the least particular has maturity been 
attained; not in the least degree do the people appreciate what 
this land may be.  It is safe to say that all the real difficulties 
of past and present are like the common little ailments of 
childhood.  Society is plastic and protean, and behavior in all 
ways is often whimsical, and rarely built upon sound and safe rules 
dictated by practical experience.  There is plenty of law, but no 
fixed policy; there is plenty of industry, but no recognized scheme 
for a concerted industrial development.  All that remains to be 
evolved, &mdash; and it will come. 
</p><p>That the people are now inclined to a wise course may be seen 
in almost every detail of the new life, as it expresses itself in 
the affairs of every day.  The desire for size is giving place to 
a sincerer desire for strength.  In the past, Omaha, like many 
another neighboring town and city, has been content to get its 
living by playing the easy part of merchantman; merely trafficking 
in commodities and catering to the simple daily needs of the 
people.  Not until within the past ten years has it consistently 
<pb n="554"/>  
tried to add to the value of what it handled, in the way of 
manufacture; and thus it has missed its greatest opportunities.  
What may be done by manufactories in Omaha and other cities of the 
Missouri Valley is incalculable.  Heretofore the immense wheat 
crops of Nebraska, have been sold outside the state, to be bought 
back as flour.  With millions of sheep upon the outlying ranges, 
there is not a yard of woolen cloth manufactured in the state.  
With millions of hides and pelts annually offered for sale, there 
is hardly a shoe or a glove made at home.  These examples are 
illustrative of a general condition.  This lack is now being felt.  
Within a few years the Commercial Club has been organized, and 
this, under able management, is doing its utmost to correct a 
faulty condition.  The establishment of manufactories will serve a 
double purpose: it will give greater stability to the town's life 
by the employment of its citizens, and it will also create home 
markets for the raw materials that are now sent far away.  
Notwithstanding its situation in the very heart of the wheat and 
corn lands, Omaha is not a grain market: the state's great crops of 
grain sift through Omaha's fingers, going to enrich other towns.  
This is likely to be remedied before the new century gets into its 
teens; and the change will link the farm and the city into a firmer 
union, and give to both a clearer understanding that their 
interests are inseparable. 
</p><p>The real virtue of the community has found fit expression its 
public schools.  To be sure, the conduct of school affairs has been 
marked by that extravagance of expenditure which has characterized 
other administrative functions; but in the schools themselves, and 
in what they stand for, is the crowning glory of the young city's 
life. 
</p><p>The most gifted of seers must stop abashed before the attempt 
to reveal the whole fortunes of this lusty youngling of the 
prairies.  Greatness awaits it, if it will merit greatness.  This 
will not come in obedience to the fiat of written law; neither by 
"enterprise" alone, of whatsoever degree of acuteness or audacity.  
It will come along broader and opener ways, attendant upon those 
men of whom it is said: "They have adjusted their souls to all 
senses, and all biases; have propt and supported them with all 
foreign helps proper for them, and enrich'd and adorn'd them with 
all they could borrow for their advantage, both within and without 
the world: those are they that are plac'd in the utmost and supreme 
height, to which human nature can attain.  They have regulated the 
world with politics and laws.  They have instructed it with arts 
and sciences, and do yet instruct it by the example of their 
admirable manners."  Mark it well: that will be the true character 
of the future men of the West.  Moral greatness must go before any 
other real greatness that ever was or ever will be.  Fifty years 
hence Omaha will be a strong city. </p>
