</p><sp><speaker>ARCHIDAMUS</speaker>
<p>If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on<lb/>
the like occasion whereon my services are now on<lb/>
foot, you shall see, as I have said, great<lb/>
difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia<lb/>
means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARCHIDAMUS</speaker>
<p>Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be<lb/>
justified in our loves; for indeed&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Beseech you,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARCHIDAMUS</speaker>
<p>Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:<lb/>
we cannot with such magnificence&mdash;in so rare&mdash;I know<lb/>
not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,<lb/>
that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,<lb/>
may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse<lb/>
us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARCHIDAMUS</speaker>
<p>Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me<lb/>
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.<lb/>
They were trained together in their childhoods; and<lb/>
there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,<lb/>
which cannot choose but branch now. Since their<lb/>
more mature dignities and royal necessities made<lb/>
separation of their society, their encounters,<lb/>
though not personal, have been royally attorneyed<lb/>
with interchange of gifts, letters, loving<lb/>
embassies; that they have seemed to be together,<lb/>
though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and<lb/>
embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed<lb/>
winds. The heavens continue their loves!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARCHIDAMUS</speaker>
<p>I think there is not in the world either malice or<lb/>
matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable<lb/>
comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a<lb/>
gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came<lb/>
into my note.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it<lb/>
is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the<lb/>
subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on<lb/>
crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to<lb/>
see him a man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARCHIDAMUS</speaker>
<p>Would they else be content to die?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should<lb/>
desire to live.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARCHIDAMUS</speaker>
<p>If the king had no son, they would desire to live<lb/>
on crutches till he had one.<lb/>

<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>A room of state in the same.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS,	POLIXENES, CAMILLO, and Attendants</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>Nine changes of the watery star hath been<lb/>
The shepherd's note since we have left our throne<lb/>
Without a burthen: time as long again<lb/>
Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;<lb/>
And yet we should, for perpetuity,<lb/>
Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,<lb/>
Yet standing in rich place, I multiply<lb/>
With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe<lb/>
That go before it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Stay your thanks a while;<lb/>
And pay them when you part.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>Sir, that's to-morrow.<lb/>
I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance<lb/>
Or breed upon our absence; that may blow<lb/>
No sneaping winds at home, to make us say<lb/>
'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd<lb/>
To tire your royalty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>We are tougher, brother,<lb/>
Than you can put us to't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>No longer stay.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>One seven-night longer.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>Very sooth, to-morrow.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>We'll part the time between's then; and in that<lb/>
I'll no gainsaying.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>Press me not, beseech you, so.<lb/>
There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,<lb/>
So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,<lb/>
Were there necessity in your request, although<lb/>
'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs<lb/>
Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder<lb/>
Were in your love a whip to me; my stay<lb/>
To you a charge and trouble: to save both,<lb/>
Farewell, our brother.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Tongue-tied, our queen?<lb/>
speak you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until<lb/>
You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,<lb/>
Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure<lb/>
All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction<lb/>
The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,<lb/>
He's beat from his best ward.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Well said, Hermione.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:<lb/>
But let him say so then, and let him go;<lb/>
But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,<lb/>
We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.<lb/>
Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure<lb/>
The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia<lb/>
You take my lord, I'll give him my commission<lb/>
To let him there a month behind the gest<lb/>
Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,<lb/>
I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind<lb/>
What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>No, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>Nay, but you will?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>I may not, verily.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>Verily!<lb/>
You put me off with limber vows; but I,<lb/>
Though you would seek to unsphere the<lb/>
stars with oaths,<lb/>
Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,<lb/>
You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's<lb/>
As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?<lb/>
Force me to keep you as a prisoner,<lb/>
Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees<lb/>
When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?<lb/>
My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'<lb/>
One of them you shall be.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>Your guest, then, madam:<lb/>
To be your prisoner should import offending;<lb/>
Which is for me less easy to commit<lb/>
Than you to punish.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>Not your gaoler, then,<lb/>
But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you<lb/>
Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:<lb/>
You were pretty lordings then?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>We were, fair queen,<lb/>
Two lads that thought there was no more behind<lb/>
But such a day to-morrow as to-day,<lb/>
And to be boy eternal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>Was not my lord<lb/>
The verier wag o' the two?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,<lb/>
And bleat the one at the other: what we changed<lb/>
Was innocence for innocence; we knew not<lb/>
The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd<lb/>
That any did. Had we pursued that life,<lb/>
And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd<lb/>
With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven<lb/>
Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd<lb/>
Hereditary ours.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>By this we gather<lb/>
You have tripp'd since.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>O my most sacred lady!<lb/>
Temptations have since then been born to's; for<lb/>
In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;<lb/>
Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes<lb/>
Of my young play-fellow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>Grace to boot!<lb/>
Of this make no conclusion, lest you say<lb/>
Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;<lb/>
The offences we have made you do we'll answer,<lb/>
If you first sinn'd with us and that with us<lb/>
You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not<lb/>
With any but with us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Is he won yet?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>He'll stay my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>At my request he would not.<lb/>
Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest<lb/>
To better purpose.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>Never?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Never, but once.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>What! have I twice said well? when was't before?<lb/>
I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's<lb/>
As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless<lb/>
Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.<lb/>
Our praises are our wages: you may ride's<lb/>
With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere<lb/>
With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:<lb/>
My last good deed was to entreat his stay:<lb/>
What was my first? it has an elder sister,<lb/>
Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!<lb/>
But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?<lb/>
Nay, let me have't; I long.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Why, that was when<lb/>
Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,<lb/>
Ere I could make thee open thy white hand<lb/>
And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter<lb/>
'I am yours for ever.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>'Tis grace indeed.<lb/>
Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:<lb/>
The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;<lb/>
The other for some while a friend.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker><p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p>
<p>Too hot, too hot!<lb/>
To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.<lb/>
I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;<lb/>
But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment<lb/>
May a free face put on, derive a liberty<lb/>
From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,<lb/>
And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;<lb/>
But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,<lb/>
As now they are, and making practised smiles,<lb/>
As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere<lb/>
The mort o' the deer; O, that is entertainment<lb/>
My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,<lb/>
Art thou my boy?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MAMILLIUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, my good lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>I' fecks!<lb/>
Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast<lb/>
smutch'd thy nose?<lb/>
They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,<lb/>
We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:<lb/>
And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf<lb/>
Are all call'd neat.&mdash;Still virginalling<lb/>
Upon his palm!&mdash;How now, you wanton calf!<lb/>
Art thou my calf?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MAMILLIUS</speaker>
<p>Yes, if you will, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,<lb/>
To be full like me: yet they say we are<lb/>
Almost as like as eggs; women say so,<lb/>
That will say anything but were they false<lb/>
As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false<lb/>
As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes<lb/>
No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true<lb/>
To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,<lb/>
Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!<lb/>
Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?&mdash;may't be?&mdash;<lb/>
Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:<lb/>
Thou dost make possible things not so held,<lb/>
Communicatest with dreams;&mdash;how can this be?&mdash;<lb/>
With what's unreal thou coactive art,<lb/>
And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent<lb/>
Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,<lb/>
And that beyond commission, and I find it,<lb/>
And that to the infection of my brains<lb/>
And hardening of my brows.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>What means Sicilia?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>He something seems unsettled.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>How, my lord!<lb/>
What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>You look as if you held a brow of much distraction<lb/>
Are you moved, my lord?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>No, in good earnest.<lb/>
How sometimes nature will betray its folly,<lb/>
Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime<lb/>
To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines<lb/>
Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil<lb/>
Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,<lb/>
In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,<lb/>
Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,<lb/>
As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:<lb/>
How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,<lb/>
This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,<lb/>
Will you take eggs for money?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MAMILLIUS</speaker>
<p>No, my lord, I'll fight.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,<lb/>
Are you so fond of your young prince as we<lb/>
Do seem to be of ours?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>If at home, sir,<lb/>
He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,<lb/>
Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,<lb/>
My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:<lb/>
He makes a July's day short as December,<lb/>
And with his varying childness cures in me<lb/>
Thoughts that would thick my blood.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>So stands this squire<lb/>
Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,<lb/>
And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,<lb/>
How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;<lb/>
Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:<lb/>
Next to thyself and my young rover, he's<lb/>
Apparent to my heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>If you would seek us,<lb/>
We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,<lb/>
Be you beneath the sky.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
I am angling now,<lb/>
Though you perceive me not how I give line.<lb/>
Go to, go to!<lb/>
How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!<lb/>
And arms her with the boldness of a wife<lb/>
To her allowing husband!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and Attendants</stage></p>


<p>
Gone already!<lb/>
Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and<lb/>
ears a fork'd one!<lb/>
Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I<lb/>
Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue<lb/>
Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour<lb/>
Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.<lb/>
There have been,<lb/>
Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;<lb/>
And many a man there is, even at this present,<lb/>
Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,<lb/>
That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence<lb/>
And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by<lb/>
Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't<lb/>
Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,<lb/>
As mine, against their will. Should all despair<lb/>
That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind<lb/>
Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;<lb/>
It is a bawdy planet, that will strike<lb/>
Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,<lb/>
From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,<lb/>
No barricado for a belly; know't;<lb/>
It will let in and out the enemy<lb/>
With bag and baggage: many thousand on's<lb/>
Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MAMILLIUS</speaker>
<p>I am like you, they say.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Ay, my good lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit MAMILLIUS</stage></p>


<p>
Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>You had much ado to make his anchor hold:<lb/>
When you cast out, it still came home.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Didst note it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>He would not stay at your petitions: made<lb/>
His business more material.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Didst perceive it?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
They're here with me already, whispering, rounding<lb/>
'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,<lb/>
When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,<lb/>
That he did stay?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>At the good queen's entreaty.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent<lb/>
But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken<lb/>
By any understanding pate but thine?<lb/>
For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in<lb/>
More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,<lb/>
But of the finer natures? by some severals<lb/>
Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes<lb/>
Perchance are to this business purblind? say.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Business, my lord! I think most understand<lb/>
Bohemia stays here longer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Ha!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Stays here longer.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Ay, but why?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>To satisfy your highness and the entreaties<lb/>
Of our most gracious mistress.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Satisfy!<lb/>
The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!<lb/>
Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,<lb/>
With all the nearest things to my heart, as well<lb/>
My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou<lb/>
Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed<lb/>
Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been<lb/>
Deceived in thy integrity, deceived<lb/>
In that which seems so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Be it forbid, my lord!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,<lb/>
If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,<lb/>
Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining<lb/>
From course required; or else thou must be counted<lb/>
A servant grafted in my serious trust<lb/>
And therein negligent; or else a fool<lb/>
That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,<lb/>
And takest it all for jest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>My gracious lord,<lb/>
I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;<lb/>
In every one of these no man is free,<lb/>
But that his negligence, his folly, fear,<lb/>
Among the infinite doings of the world,<lb/>
Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,<lb/>
If ever I were wilful-negligent,<lb/>
It was my folly; if industriously<lb/>
I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,<lb/>
Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful<lb/>
To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,<lb/>
Where of the execution did cry out<lb/>
Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear<lb/>
Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,<lb/>
Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty<lb/>
Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,<lb/>
Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass<lb/>
By its own visage: if I then deny it,<lb/>
'Tis none of mine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Ha' not you seen, Camillo,&mdash;<lb/>
But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass<lb/>
Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,&mdash;or heard,&mdash;<lb/>
For to a vision so apparent rumour<lb/>
Cannot be mute,&mdash;or thought,&mdash;for cogitation<lb/>
Resides not in that man that does not think,&mdash;<lb/>
My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,<lb/>
Or else be impudently negative,<lb/>
To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say<lb/>
My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name<lb/>
As rank as any flax-wench that puts to<lb/>
Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>I would not be a stander-by to hear<lb/>
My sovereign mistress clouded so, without<lb/>
My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,<lb/>
You never spoke what did become you less<lb/>
Than this; which to reiterate were sin<lb/>
As deep as that, though true.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Is whispering nothing?<lb/>
Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?<lb/>
Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career<lb/>
Of laughing with a sigh?&mdash;a note infallible<lb/>
Of breaking honesty&mdash;horsing foot on foot?<lb/>
Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?<lb/>
Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes<lb/>
Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,<lb/>
That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?<lb/>
Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;<lb/>
The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;<lb/>
My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,<lb/>
If this be nothing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Good my lord, be cured<lb/>
Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;<lb/>
For 'tis most dangerous.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Say it be, 'tis true.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>No, no, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>It is; you lie, you lie:<lb/>
I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,<lb/>
Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,<lb/>
Or else a hovering temporizer, that<lb/>
Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,<lb/>
Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver<lb/>
Infected as her life, she would not live<lb/>
The running of one glass.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Who does infect her?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging<lb/>
About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I<lb/>
Had servants true about me, that bare eyes<lb/>
To see alike mine honour as their profits,<lb/>
Their own particular thrifts, they would do that<lb/>
Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,<lb/>
His cupbearer,&mdash;whom I from meaner form<lb/>
Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see<lb/>
Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,<lb/>
How I am galled,&mdash;mightst bespice a cup,<lb/>
To give mine enemy a lasting wink;<lb/>
Which draught to me were cordial.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Sir, my lord,<lb/>
I could do this, and that with no rash potion,<lb/>
But with a lingering dram that should not work<lb/>
Maliciously like poison: but I cannot<lb/>
Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,<lb/>
So sovereignly being honourable.<lb/>
I have loved thee,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Make that thy question, and go rot!<lb/>
Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,<lb/>
To appoint myself in this vexation, sully<lb/>
The purity and whiteness of my sheets,<lb/>
Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted<lb/>
Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,<lb/>
Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,<lb/>
Who I do think is mine and love as mine,<lb/>
Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?<lb/>
Could man so blench?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>I must believe you, sir:<lb/>
I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;<lb/>
Provided that, when he's removed, your highness<lb/>
Will take again your queen as yours at first,<lb/>
Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing<lb/>
The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms<lb/>
Known and allied to yours.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Thou dost advise me<lb/>
Even so as I mine own course have set down:<lb/>
I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>My lord,<lb/>
Go then; and with a countenance as clear<lb/>
As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia<lb/>
And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:<lb/>
If from me he have wholesome beverage,<lb/>
Account me not your servant.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>This is all:<lb/>
Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;<lb/>
Do't not, thou split'st thine own.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>I'll do't, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>O miserable lady! But, for me,<lb/>
What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner<lb/>
Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't<lb/>
Is the obedience to a master, one<lb/>
Who in rebellion with himself will have<lb/>
All that are his so too. To do this deed,<lb/>
Promotion follows. If I could find example<lb/>
Of thousands that had struck anointed kings<lb/>
And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since<lb/>
Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,<lb/>
Let villany itself forswear't. I must<lb/>
Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain<lb/>
To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!<lb/>
Here comes Bohemia.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter POLIXENES</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>This is strange: methinks<lb/>
My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?<lb/>
Good day, Camillo.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Hail, most royal sir!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>What is the news i' the court?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>None rare, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>The king hath on him such a countenance<lb/>
As he had lost some province and a region<lb/>
Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him<lb/>
With customary compliment; when he,<lb/>
Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling<lb/>
A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and<lb/>
So leaves me to consider what is breeding<lb/>
That changeth thus his manners.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>I dare not know, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?<lb/>
Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;<lb/>
For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.<lb/>
And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,<lb/>
Your changed complexions are to me a mirror<lb/>
Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be<lb/>
A party in this alteration, finding<lb/>
Myself thus alter'd with 't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>There is a sickness<lb/>
Which puts some of us in distemper, but<lb/>
I cannot name the disease; and it is caught<lb/>
Of you that yet are well.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>How! caught of me!<lb/>
Make me not sighted like the basilisk:<lb/>
I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better<lb/>
By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,&mdash;<lb/>
As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto<lb/>
Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns<lb/>
Our gentry than our parents' noble names,<lb/>
In whose success we are gentle,&mdash;I beseech you,<lb/>
If you know aught which does behove my knowledge<lb/>
Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not<lb/>
In ignorant concealment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>I may not answer.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!<lb/>
I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,<lb/>
I conjure thee, by all the parts of man<lb/>
Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least<lb/>
Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare<lb/>
What incidency thou dost guess of harm<lb/>
Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;<lb/>
Which way to be prevented, if to be;<lb/>
If not, how best to bear it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Sir, I will tell you;<lb/>
Since I am charged in honour and by him<lb/>
That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,<lb/>
Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as<lb/>
I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me<lb/>
Cry lost, and so good night!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>On, good Camillo.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>I am appointed him to murder you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>By whom, Camillo?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>By the king.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>For what?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,<lb/>
As he had seen't or been an instrument<lb/>
To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen<lb/>
Forbiddenly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>O, then my best blood turn<lb/>
To an infected jelly and my name<lb/>
Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!<lb/>
Turn then my freshest reputation to<lb/>
A savour that may strike the dullest nostril<lb/>
Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,<lb/>
Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection<lb/>
That e'er was heard or read!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Swear his thought over<lb/>
By each particular star in heaven and<lb/>
By all their influences, you may as well<lb/>
Forbid the sea for to obey the moon<lb/>
As or by oath remove or counsel shake<lb/>
The fabric of his folly, whose foundation<lb/>
Is piled upon his faith and will continue<lb/>
The standing of his body.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>How should this grow?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to<lb/>
Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.<lb/>
If therefore you dare trust my honesty,<lb/>
That lies enclosed in this trunk which you<lb/>
Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!<lb/>
Your followers I will whisper to the business,<lb/>
And will by twos and threes at several posterns<lb/>
Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put<lb/>
My fortunes to your service, which are here<lb/>
By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;<lb/>
For, by the honour of my parents, I<lb/>
Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,<lb/>
I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer<lb/>
Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon<lb/>
His execution sworn.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>I do believe thee:<lb/>
I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:<lb/>
Be pilot to me and thy places shall<lb/>
Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and<lb/>
My people did expect my hence departure<lb/>
Two days ago. This jealousy<lb/>
Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,<lb/>
Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,<lb/>
Must it be violent, and as he does conceive<lb/>
He is dishonour'd by a man which ever<lb/>
Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must<lb/>
In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:<lb/>
Good expedition be my friend, and comfort<lb/>
The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing<lb/>
Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;<lb/>
I will respect thee as a father if<lb/>
Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>It is in mine authority to command<lb/>
The keys of all the posterns: please your highness<lb/>
To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,<lb/>
'Tis past enduring.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lady</speaker>
<p>Come, my gracious lord,<lb/>
Shall I be your playfellow?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MAMILLIUS</speaker>
<p>No, I'll none of you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lady</speaker>
<p>Why, my sweet lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MAMILLIUS</speaker>
<p>You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if<lb/>
I were a baby still. I love you better.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lady</speaker>
<p>And why so, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MAMILLIUS</speaker>
<p>Not for because<lb/>
Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,<lb/>
Become some women best, so that there be not<lb/>
Too much hair there, but in a semicircle<lb/>
Or a half-moon made with a pen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lady</speaker>
<p>Who taught you this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MAMILLIUS</speaker>
<p>I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now<lb/>
What colour are your eyebrows?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lady</speaker>
<p>Blue, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MAMILLIUS</speaker>
<p>Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose<lb/>
That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lady</speaker>
<p>Hark ye;<lb/>
The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall<lb/>
Present our services to a fine new prince<lb/>
One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,<lb/>
If we would have you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lady</speaker>
<p>She is spread of late<lb/>
Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now<lb/>
I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,<lb/>
And tell 's a tale.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MAMILLIUS</speaker>
<p>Merry or sad shall't be?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>As merry as you will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MAMILLIUS</speaker>
<p>A sad tale's best for winter: I have one<lb/>
Of sprites and goblins.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>Let's have that, good sir.<lb/>
Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best<lb/>
To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MAMILLIUS</speaker>
<p>There was a man&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>Nay, come, sit down; then on.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MAMILLIUS</speaker>
<p>Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;<lb/>
Yond crickets shall not hear it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>Come on, then,<lb/>
And give't me in mine ear.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter LEONTES, with ANTIGONUS, Lords and others</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never<lb/>
Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them<lb/>
Even to their ships.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>How blest am I<lb/>
In my just censure, in my true opinion!<lb/>
Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed<lb/>
In being so blest! There may be in the cup<lb/>
A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,<lb/>
And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge<lb/>
Is not infected: but if one present<lb/>
The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known<lb/>
How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,<lb/>
With violent hefts. I have drunk,<lb/>
and seen the spider.<lb/>
Camillo was his help in this, his pander:<lb/>
There is a plot against my life, my crown;<lb/>
All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain<lb/>
Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:<lb/>
He has discover'd my design, and I<lb/>
Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick<lb/>
For them to play at will. How came the posterns<lb/>
So easily open?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>By his great authority;<lb/>
Which often hath no less prevail'd than so<lb/>
On your command.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>I know't too well.<lb/>
Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:<lb/>
Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you<lb/>
Have too much blood in him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>What is this? sport?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;<lb/>
Away with him! and let her sport herself<lb/>
With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes<lb/>
Has made thee swell thus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>But I'ld say he had not,<lb/>
And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,<lb/>
Howe'er you lean to the nayward.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>You, my lords,<lb/>
Look on her, mark her well; be but about<lb/>
To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and<lb/>
The justice of your bearts will thereto add<lb/>
'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'<lb/>
Praise her but for this her without-door form,<lb/>
Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight<lb/>
The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands<lb/>
That calumny doth use&mdash;O, I am out&mdash;<lb/>
That mercy does, for calumny will sear<lb/>
Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,<lb/>
When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between<lb/>
Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,<lb/>
From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,<lb/>
She's an adulteress.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>Should a villain say so,<lb/>
The most replenish'd villain in the world,<lb/>
He were as much more villain: you, my lord,<lb/>
Do but mistake.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>You have mistook, my lady,<lb/>
Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!<lb/>
Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,<lb/>
Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,<lb/>
Should a like language use to all degrees<lb/>
And mannerly distinguishment leave out<lb/>
Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said<lb/>
She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:<lb/>
More, she's a traitor and Camillo is<lb/>
A federary with her, and one that knows<lb/>
What she should shame to know herself<lb/>
But with her most vile principal, that she's<lb/>
A bed-swerver, even as bad as those<lb/>
That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy<lb/>
To this their late escape.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>No, by my life.<lb/>
Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,<lb/>
When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that<lb/>
You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,<lb/>
You scarce can right me throughly then to say<lb/>
You did mistake.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>No; if I mistake<lb/>
In those foundations which I build upon,<lb/>
The centre is not big enough to bear<lb/>
A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!<lb/>
He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty<lb/>
But that he speaks.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>There's some ill planet reigns:<lb/>
I must be patient till the heavens look<lb/>
With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,<lb/>
I am not prone to weeping, as our sex<lb/>
Commonly are; the want of which vain dew<lb/>
Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have<lb/>
That honourable grief lodged here which burns<lb/>
Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,<lb/>
With thoughts so qualified as your charities<lb/>
Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so<lb/>
The king's will be perform'd!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Shall I be heard?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,<lb/>
My women may be with me; for you see<lb/>
My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;<lb/>
There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress<lb/>
Has deserved prison, then abound in tears<lb/>
As I come out: this action I now go on<lb/>
Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:<lb/>
I never wish'd to see you sorry; now<lb/>
I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Go, do our bidding; hence!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit HERMIONE, guarded; with Ladies</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Beseech your highness, call the queen again.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIGONUS</speaker>
<p>Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice<lb/>
Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,<lb/>
Yourself, your queen, your son.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>For her, my lord,<lb/>
I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,<lb/>
Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless<lb/>
I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,<lb/>
In this which you accuse her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIGONUS</speaker>
<p>If it prove<lb/>
She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where<lb/>
I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;<lb/>
Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;<lb/>
For every inch of woman in the world,<lb/>
Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Hold your peaces.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Good my lord,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIGONUS</speaker>
<p>It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:<lb/>
You are abused and by some putter-on<lb/>
That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,<lb/>
I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,<lb/>
I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven<lb/>
The second and the third, nine, and some five;<lb/>
If this prove true, they'll pay for't:<lb/>
by mine honour,<lb/>
I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,<lb/>
To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;<lb/>
And I had rather glib myself than they<lb/>
Should not produce fair issue.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Cease; no more.<lb/>
You smell this business with a sense as cold<lb/>
As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't<lb/>
As you feel doing thus; and see withal<lb/>
The instruments that feel.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIGONUS</speaker>
<p>If it be so,<lb/>
We need no grave to bury honesty:<lb/>
There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten<lb/>
Of the whole dungy earth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>What! lack I credit?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,<lb/>
Upon this ground; and more it would content me<lb/>
To have her honour true than your suspicion,<lb/>
Be blamed for't how you might.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Why, what need we<lb/>
Commune with you of this, but rather follow<lb/>
Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative<lb/>
Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness<lb/>
Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied<lb/>
Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not<lb/>
Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves<lb/>
We need no more of your advice: the matter,<lb/>
The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all<lb/>
Properly ours.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIGONUS</speaker>
<p>And I wish, my liege,<lb/>
You had only in your silent judgment tried it,<lb/>
Without more overture.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>How could that be?<lb/>
Either thou art most ignorant by age,<lb/>
Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,<lb/>
Added to their familiarity,<lb/>
Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,<lb/>
That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation<lb/>
But only seeing, all other circumstances<lb/>
Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:<lb/>
Yet, for a greater confirmation,<lb/>
For in an act of this importance 'twere<lb/>
Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post<lb/>
To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,<lb/>
Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know<lb/>
Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle<lb/>
They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,<lb/>
Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Well done, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Though I am satisfied and need no more<lb/>
Than what I know, yet shall the oracle<lb/>
Give rest to the minds of others, such as he<lb/>
Whose ignorant credulity will not<lb/>
Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good<lb/>
From our free person she should be confined,<lb/>
Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence<lb/>
Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;<lb/>
We are to speak in public; for this business<lb/>
Will raise us all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIGONUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>
To laughter, as I take it,<lb/>
If the good truth were known.<lb/>

I must be present at your conference.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>Well, be't so, prithee.<lb/>

Here's such ado to make no stain a stain<lb/>
As passes colouring.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter Gaoler, with EMILIA</stage></p>


<p>
Dear gentlewoman,<lb/>
How fares our gracious lady?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>As well as one so great and so forlorn<lb/>
May hold together: on her frights and griefs,<lb/>
Which never tender lady hath born greater,<lb/>
She is something before her time deliver'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>A boy?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>A daughter, and a goodly babe,<lb/>
Lusty and like to live: the queen receives<lb/>
Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,<lb/>
I am innocent as you.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>I dare be sworn<lb/>
These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,<lb/>
beshrew them!<lb/>
He must be told on't, and he shall: the office<lb/>
Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:<lb/>
If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister<lb/>
And never to my red-look'd anger be<lb/>
The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,<lb/>
Commend my best obedience to the queen:<lb/>
If she dares trust me with her little babe,<lb/>
I'll show't the king and undertake to be<lb/>
Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know<lb/>
How he may soften at the sight o' the child:<lb/>
The silence often of pure innocence<lb/>
Persuades when speaking fails.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>EMILIA</speaker>
<p>Most worthy madam,<lb/>
Your honour and your goodness is so evident<lb/>
That your free undertaking cannot miss<lb/>
A thriving issue: there is no lady living<lb/>
So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship<lb/>
To visit the next room, I'll presently<lb/>
Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;<lb/>
Who but to-day hammer'd of this design,<lb/>
But durst not tempt a minister of honour,<lb/>
Lest she should be denied.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>Tell her, Emilia.<lb/>
I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't<lb/>
As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted<lb/>
I shall do good.<lb/>

<p>Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,<lb/>
I know not what I shall incur to pass it,<lb/>
Having no warrant.<lb/>

<p>You need not fear it, sir:<lb/>
This child was prisoner to the womb and is<lb/>
By law and process of great nature thence<lb/>
Freed and enfranchised, not a party to<lb/>
The anger of the king nor guilty of,<lb/>
If any be, the trespass of the queen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gaoler</speaker>

<p><stage>A room in LEONTES' palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter LEONTES, ANTIGONUS, Lords, and Servants</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness<lb/>
To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If<lb/>
The cause were not in being,&mdash;part o' the cause,<lb/>
She the adulteress; for the harlot king<lb/>
Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank<lb/>
And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she<lb/>
I can hook to me: say that she were gone,<lb/>
Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest<lb/>
Might come to me again. Who's there?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Servant</speaker>
<p>My lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>How does the boy?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Servant</speaker>
<p>He took good rest to-night;<lb/>
'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>To see his nobleness!<lb/>
Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,<lb/>
He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,<lb/>
Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,<lb/>
Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,<lb/>
And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,<lb/>
See how he fares.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit Servant</stage></p>


<p>
Fie, fie! no thought of him:<lb/>
The thought of my revenges that way<lb/>
Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,<lb/>
And in his parties, his alliance; let him be<lb/>
Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,<lb/>
Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes<lb/>
Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:<lb/>
They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor<lb/>
Shall she within my power.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter PAULINA, with a child</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>You must not enter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:<lb/>
Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,<lb/>
Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,<lb/>
More free than he is jealous.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIGONUS</speaker>
<p>That's enough.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Servant</speaker>
<p>Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded<lb/>
None should come at him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>Not so hot, good sir:<lb/>
I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,<lb/>
That creep like shadows by him and do sigh<lb/>
At each his needless heavings, such as you<lb/>
Nourish the cause of his awaking: I<lb/>
Do come with words as medicinal as true,<lb/>
Honest as either, to purge him of that humour<lb/>
That presses him from sleep.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>What noise there, ho?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>No noise, my lord; but needful conference<lb/>
About some gossips for your highness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>How!<lb/>
Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,<lb/>
I charged thee that she should not come about me:<lb/>
I knew she would.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIGONUS</speaker>
<p>I told her so, my lord,<lb/>
On your displeasure's peril and on mine,<lb/>
She should not visit you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>What, canst not rule her?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>From all dishonesty he can: in this,<lb/>
Unless he take the course that you have done,<lb/>
Commit me for committing honour, trust it,<lb/>
He shall not rule me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIGONUS</speaker>
<p>La you now, you hear:<lb/>
When she will take the rein I let her run;<lb/>
But she'll not stumble.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>Good my liege, I come;<lb/>
And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess<lb/>
Myself your loyal servant, your physician,<lb/>
Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare<lb/>
Less appear so in comforting your evils,<lb/>
Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come<lb/>
From your good queen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Good queen!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>Good queen, my lord,<lb/>
Good queen; I say good queen;<lb/>
And would by combat make her good, so were I<lb/>
A man, the worst about you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Force her hence.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes<lb/>
First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;<lb/>
But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,<lb/>
For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;<lb/>
Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Laying down the child</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Out!<lb/>
A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:<lb/>
A most intelligencing bawd!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>Not so:<lb/>
I am as ignorant in that as you<lb/>
In so entitling me, and no less honest<lb/>
Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,<lb/>
As this world goes, to pass for honest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Traitors!<lb/>
Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.<lb/>
Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted<lb/>
By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;<lb/>
Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>For ever<lb/>
Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou<lb/>
Takest up the princess by that forced baseness<lb/>
Which he has put upon't!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>He dreads his wife.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt<lb/>
You'ld call your children yours.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>A nest of traitors!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIGONUS</speaker>
<p>I am none, by this good light.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>Nor I, nor any<lb/>
But one that's here, and that's himself, for he<lb/>
The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,<lb/>
His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,<lb/>
Whose sting is sharper than the sword's;<lb/>
and will not&mdash;<lb/>
For, as the case now stands, it is a curse<lb/>
He cannot be compell'd to't&mdash;once remove<lb/>
The root of his opinion, which is rotten<lb/>
As ever oak or stone was sound.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>A callat<lb/>
Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband<lb/>
And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;<lb/>
It is the issue of Polixenes:<lb/>
Hence with it, and together with the dam<lb/>
Commit them to the fire!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>It is yours;<lb/>
And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,<lb/>
So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,<lb/>
Although the print be little, the whole matter<lb/>
And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,<lb/>
The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,<lb/>
The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,<lb/>
His smiles,<lb/>
The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:<lb/>
And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it<lb/>
So like to him that got it, if thou hast<lb/>
The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours<lb/>
No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,<lb/>
Her children not her husband's!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>A gross hag<lb/>
And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,<lb/>
That wilt not stay her tongue.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIGONUS</speaker>
<p>Hang all the husbands<lb/>
That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself<lb/>
Hardly one subject.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Once more, take her hence.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>A most unworthy and unnatural lord<lb/>
Can do no more.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>I'll ha' thee burnt.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>I care not:<lb/>
It is an heretic that makes the fire,<lb/>
Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;<lb/>
But this most cruel usage of your queen,<lb/>
Not able to produce more accusation<lb/>
Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours<lb/>
Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,<lb/>
Yea, scandalous to the world.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>On your allegiance,<lb/>
Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,<lb/>
Where were her life? she durst not call me so,<lb/>
If she did know me one. Away with her!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.<lb/>
Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:<lb/>
Jove send her<lb/>
A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?<lb/>
You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,<lb/>
Will never do him good, not one of you.<lb/>
So, so: farewell; we are gone.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.<lb/>
My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast<lb/>
A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence<lb/>
And see it instantly consumed with fire;<lb/>
Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:<lb/>
Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,<lb/>
And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,<lb/>
With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse<lb/>
And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;<lb/>
The bastard brains with these my proper hands<lb/>
Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;<lb/>
For thou set'st on thy wife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIGONUS</speaker>
<p>I did not, sir:<lb/>
These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,<lb/>
Can clear me in't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lords</speaker>
<p>We can: my royal liege,<lb/>
He is not guilty of her coming hither.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>You're liars all.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Beseech your highness, give us better credit:<lb/>
We have always truly served you, and beseech you<lb/>
So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,<lb/>
As recompense of our dear services<lb/>
Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,<lb/>
Which being so horrible, so bloody, must<lb/>
Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>I am a feather for each wind that blows:<lb/>
Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel<lb/>
And call me father? better burn it now<lb/>
Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.<lb/>
It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;<lb/>
You that have been so tenderly officious<lb/>
With Lady Margery, your midwife there,<lb/>
To save this bastard's life,&mdash;for 'tis a bastard,<lb/>
So sure as this beard's grey,<lb/>
&mdash;what will you adventure<lb/>
To save this brat's life?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIGONUS</speaker>
<p>Any thing, my lord,<lb/>
That my ability may undergo<lb/>
And nobleness impose: at least thus much:<lb/>
I'll pawn the little blood which I have left<lb/>
To save the innocent: any thing possible.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>It shall be possible. Swear by this sword<lb/>
Thou wilt perform my bidding.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIGONUS</speaker>
<p>I will, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail<lb/>
Of any point in't shall not only be<lb/>
Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,<lb/>
Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,<lb/>
As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry<lb/>
This female bastard hence and that thou bear it<lb/>
To some remote and desert place quite out<lb/>
Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,<lb/>
Without more mercy, to its own protection<lb/>
And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune<lb/>
It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,<lb/>
On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,<lb/>
That thou commend it strangely to some place<lb/>
Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIGONUS</speaker>
<p>I swear to do this, though a present death<lb/>
Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:<lb/>
Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens<lb/>
To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say<lb/>
Casting their savageness aside have done<lb/>
Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous<lb/>
In more than this deed does require! And blessing<lb/>
Against this cruelty fight on thy side,<lb/>
Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit with the child</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>No, I'll not rear<lb/>
Another's issue.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Please your highness, posts<lb/>
From those you sent to the oracle are come<lb/>
An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,<lb/>
Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,<lb/>
Hasting to the court.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>So please you, sir, their speed<lb/>
Hath been beyond account.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Twenty-three days<lb/>
They have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells<lb/>
The great Apollo suddenly will have<lb/>
The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;<lb/>
Summon a session, that we may arraign<lb/>
Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath<lb/>
Been publicly accused, so shall she have<lb/>
A just and open trial. While she lives<lb/>
My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,<lb/>
And think upon my bidding.<lb/>

<p><stage>A court of Justice.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter LEONTES, Lords, and Officers</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,<lb/>
Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried<lb/>
The daughter of a king, our wife, and one<lb/>
Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd<lb/>
Of being tyrannous, since we so openly<lb/>
Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,<lb/>
Even to the guilt or the purgation.<lb/>
Produce the prisoner.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Officer</speaker>
<p>It is his highness' pleasure that the queen<lb/>
Appear in person here in court. Silence!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter HERMIONE guarded;	PAULINA and Ladies attending</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Read the indictment.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Officer</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reads]</stage></p><p>            Hermione, queen to the worthy<lb/>
Leontes, king of Sicilia, thou art here accused and<lb/>
arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery<lb/>
with Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiring<lb/>
with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign<lb/>
lord the king, thy royal husband: the pretence<lb/>
whereof being by circumstances partly laid open,<lb/>
thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance<lb/>
of a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for<lb/>
their better safety, to fly away by night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>Since what I am to say must be but that<lb/>
Which contradicts my accusation and<lb/>
The testimony on my part no other<lb/>
But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me<lb/>
To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity<lb/>
Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,<lb/>
Be so received. But thus: if powers divine<lb/>
Behold our human actions, as they do,<lb/>
I doubt not then but innocence shall make<lb/>
False accusation blush and tyranny<lb/>
Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,<lb/>
Who least will seem to do so, my past life<lb/>
Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,<lb/>
As I am now unhappy; which is more<lb/>
Than history can pattern, though devised<lb/>
And play'd to take spectators. For behold me<lb/>
A fellow of the royal bed, which owe<lb/>
A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,<lb/>
The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing<lb/>
To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore<lb/>
Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it<lb/>
As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,<lb/>
'Tis a derivative from me to mine,<lb/>
And only that I stand for. I appeal<lb/>
To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes<lb/>
Came to your court, how I was in your grace,<lb/>
How merited to be so; since he came,<lb/>
With what encounter so uncurrent I<lb/>
Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond<lb/>
The bound of honour, or in act or will<lb/>
That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts<lb/>
Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin<lb/>
Cry fie upon my grave!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>I ne'er heard yet<lb/>
That any of these bolder vices wanted<lb/>
Less impudence to gainsay what they did<lb/>
Than to perform it first.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>That's true enough;<lb/>
Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>You will not own it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>More than mistress of<lb/>
Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not<lb/>
At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,<lb/>
With whom I am accused, I do confess<lb/>
I loved him as in honour he required,<lb/>
With such a kind of love as might become<lb/>
A lady like me, with a love even such,<lb/>
So and no other, as yourself commanded:<lb/>
Which not to have done I think had been in me<lb/>
Both disobedience and ingratitude<lb/>
To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,<lb/>
Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely<lb/>
That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,<lb/>
I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd<lb/>
For me to try how: all I know of it<lb/>
Is that Camillo was an honest man;<lb/>
And why he left your court, the gods themselves,<lb/>
Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>You knew of his departure, as you know<lb/>
What you have underta'en to do in's absence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>Sir,<lb/>
You speak a language that I understand not:<lb/>
My life stands in the level of your dreams,<lb/>
Which I'll lay down.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Your actions are my dreams;<lb/>
You had a bastard by Polixenes,<lb/>
And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,&mdash;<lb/>
Those of your fact are so&mdash;so past all truth:<lb/>
Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as<lb/>
Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,<lb/>
No father owning it,&mdash;which is, indeed,<lb/>
More criminal in thee than it,&mdash;so thou<lb/>
Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage<lb/>
Look for no less than death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>Sir, spare your threats:<lb/>
The bug which you would fright me with I seek.<lb/>
To me can life be no commodity:<lb/>
The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,<lb/>
I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,<lb/>
But know not how it went. My second joy<lb/>
And first-fruits of my body, from his presence<lb/>
I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort<lb/>
Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,<lb/>
The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,<lb/>
Haled out to murder: myself on every post<lb/>
Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred<lb/>
The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs<lb/>
To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried<lb/>
Here to this place, i' the open air, before<lb/>
I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,<lb/>
Tell me what blessings I have here alive,<lb/>
That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.<lb/>
But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,<lb/>
I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,<lb/>
Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd<lb/>
Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else<lb/>
But what your jealousies awake, I tell you<lb/>
'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,<lb/>
I do refer me to the oracle:<lb/>
Apollo be my judge!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>This your request<lb/>
Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,<lb/>
And in Apollos name, his oracle.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt certain Officers</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>The Emperor of Russia was my father:<lb/>
O that he were alive, and here beholding<lb/>
His daughter's trial! that he did but see<lb/>
The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes<lb/>
Of pity, not revenge!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter Officers, with CLEOMENES and DION</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Officer</speaker>
<p>You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,<lb/>
That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have<lb/>
Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought<lb/>
The seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd<lb/>
Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,<lb/>
You have not dared to break the holy seal<lb/>
Nor read the secrets in't.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOMENES, DION</speaker>
<p>All this we swear.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Break up the seals and read.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Officer</speaker><p><stage>[Reads]</stage></p>
<p>Hermione is chaste;<lb/>
Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject; Leontes<lb/>
a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten;<lb/>
and the king shall live without an heir, if that<lb/>
which is lost be not found.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lords</speaker>
<p>Now blessed be the great Apollo!<lb/>

<p>Praised!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Hast thou read truth?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Officer</speaker>
<p>Ay, my lord; even so<lb/>
As it is here set down.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>There is no truth at all i' the oracle:<lb/>
The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>My lord the king, the king!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>What is the business?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>O sir, I shall be hated to report it!<lb/>
The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear<lb/>
Of the queen's speed, is gone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>How! gone!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Is dead.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves<lb/>
Do strike at my injustice.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>HERMIONE swoons</stage></p>


<p>
How now there!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>This news is mortal to the queen: look down<lb/>
And see what death is doing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Take her hence:<lb/>
Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:<lb/>
I have too much believed mine own suspicion:<lb/>
Beseech you, tenderly apply to her<lb/>
Some remedies for life.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt PAULINA and Ladies, with HERMIONE</stage></p>


<p>
Apollo, pardon<lb/>
My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!<lb/>
I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,<lb/>
New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,<lb/>
Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;<lb/>
For, being transported by my jealousies<lb/>
To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose<lb/>
Camillo for the minister to poison<lb/>
My friend Polixenes: which had been done,<lb/>
But that the good mind of Camillo tardied<lb/>
My swift command, though I with death and with<lb/>
Reward did threaten and encourage him,<lb/>
Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane<lb/>
And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest<lb/>
Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,<lb/>
Which you knew great, and to the hazard<lb/>
Of all encertainties himself commended,<lb/>
No richer than his honour: how he glisters<lb/>
Thorough my rust! and how his pity<lb/>
Does my deeds make the blacker!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter PAULINA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>Woe the while!<lb/>
O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,<lb/>
Break too.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>What fit is this, good lady?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?<lb/>
What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?<lb/>
In leads or oils? what old or newer torture<lb/>
Must I receive, whose every word deserves<lb/>
To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny<lb/>
Together working with thy jealousies,<lb/>
Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle<lb/>
For girls of nine, O, think what they have done<lb/>
And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all<lb/>
Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.<lb/>
That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;<lb/>
That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant<lb/>
And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,<lb/>
Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,<lb/>
To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,<lb/>
More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon<lb/>
The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter<lb/>
To be or none or little; though a devil<lb/>
Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:<lb/>
Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death<lb/>
Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,<lb/>
Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart<lb/>
That could conceive a gross and foolish sire<lb/>
Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,<lb/>
Laid to thy answer: but the last,&mdash;O lords,<lb/>
When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,<lb/>
The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,<lb/>
and vengeance for't<lb/>
Not dropp'd down yet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>The higher powers forbid!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath<lb/>
Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring<lb/>
Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,<lb/>
Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you<lb/>
As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!<lb/>
Do not repent these things, for they are heavier<lb/>
Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee<lb/>
To nothing but despair. A thousand knees<lb/>
Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,<lb/>
Upon a barren mountain and still winter<lb/>
In storm perpetual, could not move the gods<lb/>
To look that way thou wert.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Go on, go on<lb/>
Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved<lb/>
All tongues to talk their bitterest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Say no more:<lb/>
Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault<lb/>
I' the boldness of your speech.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>I am sorry for't:<lb/>
All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,<lb/>
I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much<lb/>
The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd<lb/>
To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help<lb/>
Should be past grief: do not receive affliction<lb/>
At my petition; I beseech you, rather<lb/>
Let me be punish'd, that have minded you<lb/>
Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege<lb/>
Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:<lb/>
The love I bore your queen&mdash;lo, fool again!&mdash;<lb/>
I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;<lb/>
I'll not remember you of my own lord,<lb/>
Who is lost too: take your patience to you,<lb/>
And I'll say nothing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Thou didst speak but well<lb/>
When most the truth; which I receive much better<lb/>
Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me<lb/>
To the dead bodies of my queen and son:<lb/>
One grave shall be for both: upon them shall<lb/>
The causes of their death appear, unto<lb/>
Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit<lb/>
The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there<lb/>
Shall be my recreation: so long as nature<lb/>
Will bear up with this exercise, so long<lb/>
I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me<lb/>
Unto these sorrows.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>ANTIGONUS</speaker>
<p>Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon<lb/>
The deserts of Bohemia?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mariner</speaker>
<p>Ay, my lord: and fear<lb/>
We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly<lb/>
And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,<lb/>
The heavens with that we have in hand are angry<lb/>
And frown upon 's.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIGONUS</speaker>
<p>Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;<lb/>
Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before<lb/>
I call upon thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mariner</speaker>
<p>Make your best haste, and go not<lb/>
Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;<lb/>
Besides, this place is famous for the creatures<lb/>
Of prey that keep upon't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIGONUS</speaker>
<p>Go thou away:<lb/>
I'll follow instantly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Mariner</speaker>
<p>I am glad at heart<lb/>
To be so rid o' the business.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIGONUS</speaker>
<p>Come, poor babe:<lb/>
I have heard, but not believed,<lb/>
the spirits o' the dead<lb/>
May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother<lb/>
Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream<lb/>
So like a waking. To me comes a creature,<lb/>
Sometimes her head on one side, some another;<lb/>
I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,<lb/>
So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,<lb/>
Like very sanctity, she did approach<lb/>
My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,<lb/>
And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes<lb/>
Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon<lb/>
Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,<lb/>
Since fate, against thy better disposition,<lb/>
Hath made thy person for the thrower-out<lb/>
Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,<lb/>
Places remote enough are in Bohemia,<lb/>
There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe<lb/>
Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,<lb/>
I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business<lb/>
Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see<lb/>
Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks<lb/>
She melted into air. Affrighted much,<lb/>
I did in time collect myself and thought<lb/>
This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:<lb/>
Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,<lb/>
I will be squared by this. I do believe<lb/>
Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that<lb/>
Apollo would, this being indeed the issue<lb/>
Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,<lb/>
Either for life or death, upon the earth<lb/>
Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!<lb/>
There lie, and there thy character: there these;<lb/>
Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,<lb/>
And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,<lb/>
That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed<lb/>
To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,<lb/>
But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I<lb/>
To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!<lb/>
The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have<lb/>
A lullaby too rough: I never saw<lb/>
The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!<lb/>
Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:<lb/>
I am gone for ever.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit, pursued by a bear</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter a Shepherd</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>I would there were no age between sixteen and<lb/>
three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the<lb/>
rest; for there is nothing in the between but<lb/>
getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,<lb/>
stealing, fighting&mdash;Hark you now! Would any but<lb/>
these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty<lb/>
hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my<lb/>
best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find<lb/>
than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by<lb/>
the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy<lb/>
will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very<lb/>
pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A<lb/>
pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:<lb/>
though I am not bookish, yet I can read<lb/>
waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been<lb/>
some stair-work, some trunk-work, some<lb/>
behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this<lb/>
than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for<lb/>
pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed<lb/>
but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Clown</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Hilloa, loa!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk<lb/>
on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What<lb/>
ailest thou, man?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!<lb/>
but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the<lb/>
sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust<lb/>
a bodkin's point.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Why, boy, how is it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,<lb/>
how it takes up the shore! but that's not the<lb/>
point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!<lb/>
sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the<lb/>
ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon<lb/>
swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a<lb/>
cork into a hogshead. And then for the<lb/>
land-service, to see how the bear tore out his<lb/>
shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said<lb/>
his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an<lb/>
end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned<lb/>
it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the<lb/>
sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared<lb/>
and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than<lb/>
the sea or weather.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Name of mercy, when was this, boy?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these<lb/>
sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor<lb/>
the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it<lb/>
now.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>I would you had been by the ship side, to have<lb/>
helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,<lb/>
boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things<lb/>
dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for<lb/>
thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's<lb/>
child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;<lb/>
open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be<lb/>
rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:<lb/>
open't. What's within, boy?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth<lb/>
are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up<lb/>
with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.<lb/>
We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires<lb/>
nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good<lb/>
boy, the next way home.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see<lb/>
if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much<lb/>
he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they<lb/>
are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury<lb/>
it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that<lb/>
which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the<lb/>
sight of him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter Time, the Chorus</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Time</speaker>
<p>I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror<lb/>
Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,<lb/>
Now take upon me, in the name of Time,<lb/>
To use my wings. Impute it not a crime<lb/>
To me or my swift passage, that I slide<lb/>
O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried<lb/>
Of that wide gap, since it is in my power<lb/>
To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour<lb/>
To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass<lb/>
The same I am, ere ancient'st order was<lb/>
Or what is now received: I witness to<lb/>
The times that brought them in; so shall I do<lb/>
To the freshest things now reigning and make stale<lb/>
The glistering of this present, as my tale<lb/>
Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,<lb/>
I turn my glass and give my scene such growing<lb/>
As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,<lb/>
The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving<lb/>
That he shuts up himself, imagine me,<lb/>
Gentle spectators, that I now may be<lb/>
In fair Bohemia, and remember well,<lb/>
I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel<lb/>
I now name to you; and with speed so pace<lb/>
To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace<lb/>
Equal with wondering: what of her ensues<lb/>
I list not prophecy; but let Time's news<lb/>
Be known when 'tis brought forth.<lb/>
A shepherd's daughter,<lb/>
And what to her adheres, which follows after,<lb/>
Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,<lb/>
If ever you have spent time worse ere now;<lb/>
If never, yet that Time himself doth say<lb/>
He wishes earnestly you never may.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter POLIXENES and CAMILLO</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:<lb/>
'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to<lb/>
grant this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though<lb/>
I have for the most part been aired abroad, I<lb/>
desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent<lb/>
king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling<lb/>
sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to<lb/>
think so, which is another spur to my departure.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of<lb/>
thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of<lb/>
thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to<lb/>
have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having<lb/>
made me businesses which none without thee can<lb/>
sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute<lb/>
them thyself or take away with thee the very<lb/>
services thou hast done; which if I have not enough<lb/>
considered, as too much I cannot, to be more<lb/>
thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit<lb/>
therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal<lb/>
country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very<lb/>
naming punishes me with the remembrance of that<lb/>
penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,<lb/>
my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen<lb/>
and children are even now to be afresh lamented.<lb/>
Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my<lb/>
son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not<lb/>
being gracious, than they are in losing them when<lb/>
they have approved their virtues.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What<lb/>
his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I<lb/>
have missingly noted, he is of late much retired<lb/>
from court and is less frequent to his princely<lb/>
exercises than formerly he hath appeared.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some<lb/>
care; so far that I have eyes under my service which<lb/>
look upon his removedness; from whom I have this<lb/>
intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a<lb/>
most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from<lb/>
very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his<lb/>
neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a<lb/>
daughter of most rare note: the report of her is<lb/>
extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I<lb/>
fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou<lb/>
shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not<lb/>
appearing what we are, have some question with the<lb/>
shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not<lb/>
uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.<lb/>
Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and<lb/>
lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>I willingly obey your command.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.<lb/>

</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>

<head>Scene 3</head>

<p><stage>A road near the Shepherd's cottage.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>When daffodils begin to peer,<lb/>
With heigh! the doxy over the dale,<lb/>
Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;<lb/>
For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.<lb/>

The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,<lb/>
With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!<lb/>
Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;<lb/>
For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.<lb/>

The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,<lb/>
With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,<lb/>
Are summer songs for me and my aunts,<lb/>
While we lie tumbling in the hay.<lb/>

I have served Prince Florizel and in my time<lb/>
wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:<lb/>

But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?<lb/>
The pale moon shines by night:<lb/>
And when I wander here and there,<lb/>
I then do most go right.<lb/>

If tinkers may have leave to live,<lb/>
And bear the sow-skin budget,<lb/>
Then my account I well may, give,<lb/>
And in the stocks avouch it.<lb/>

My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to<lb/>
lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who<lb/>
being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise<lb/>
a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and<lb/>
drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is<lb/>
the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful<lb/>
on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to<lb/>
me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought<lb/>
of it. A prize! a prize!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Clown</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod<lb/>
yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred<lb/>
shorn. what comes the wool to?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>
If the springe hold, the cock's mine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am<lb/>
I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound<lb/>
of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,&mdash;what will<lb/>
this sister of mine do with rice? But my father<lb/>
hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it<lb/>
on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for<lb/>
the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good<lb/>
ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but<lb/>
one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to<lb/>
horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden<lb/>
pies; mace; dates?&mdash;none, that's out of my note;<lb/>
nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I<lb/>
may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of<lb/>
raisins o' the sun.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>O that ever I was born!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Grovelling on the ground</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>I' the name of me&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and<lb/>
then, death, death!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay<lb/>
on thee, rather than have these off.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more<lb/>
than the stripes I have received, which are mighty<lb/>
ones and millions.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a<lb/>
great matter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel<lb/>
ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon<lb/>
me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>What, by a horseman, or a footman?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>A footman, sweet sir, a footman.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he<lb/>
has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,<lb/>
it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,<lb/>
I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>O, good sir, tenderly, O!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Alas, poor soul!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my<lb/>
shoulder-blade is out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>How now! canst stand?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Picking his pocket]</stage></p><p>
Softly, dear sir; good sir, softly. You ha' done me<lb/>
a charitable office.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have<lb/>
a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,<lb/>
unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or<lb/>
any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;<lb/>
that kills my heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with<lb/>
troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the<lb/>
prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his<lb/>
virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped<lb/>
out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay<lb/>
there; and yet it will no more but abide.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he<lb/>
hath been since an ape-bearer; then a<lb/>
process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a<lb/>
motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's<lb/>
wife within a mile where my land and living lies;<lb/>
and, having flown over many knavish professions, he<lb/>
settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts<lb/>
wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that<lb/>
put me into this apparel.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had<lb/>
but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am<lb/>
false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant<lb/>
him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>How do you now?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and<lb/>
walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace<lb/>
softly towards my kinsman's.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Shall I bring thee on the way?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our<lb/>
sheep-shearing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Prosper you, sweet sir!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit Clown</stage></p>


<p>
Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.<lb/>
I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I<lb/>
make not this cheat bring out another and the<lb/>
shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name<lb/>
put in the book of virtue!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Sings</stage></p>


<p>
Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,<lb/>
And merrily hent the stile-a:<lb/>
A merry heart goes all the day,<lb/>
Your sad tires in a mile-a.<lb/>

<head>Scene 4</head>

<p><stage>The Shepherd's cottage.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter FLORIZEL and PERDITA</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>These your unusual weeds to each part of you<lb/>
Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora<lb/>
Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing<lb/>
Is as a meeting of the petty gods,<lb/>
And you the queen on't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p>Sir, my gracious lord,<lb/>
To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:<lb/>
O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,<lb/>
The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured<lb/>
With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,<lb/>
Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts<lb/>
In every mess have folly and the feeders<lb/>
Digest it with a custom, I should blush<lb/>
To see you so attired, sworn, I think,<lb/>
To show myself a glass.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>I bless the time<lb/>
When my good falcon made her flight across<lb/>
Thy father's ground.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p>Now Jove afford you cause!<lb/>
To me the difference forges dread; your greatness<lb/>
Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble<lb/>
To think your father, by some accident,<lb/>
Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!<lb/>
How would he look, to see his work so noble<lb/>
Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how<lb/>
Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold<lb/>
The sternness of his presence?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>Apprehend<lb/>
Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,<lb/>
Humbling their deities to love, have taken<lb/>
The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter<lb/>
Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune<lb/>
A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,<lb/>
Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,<lb/>
As I seem now. Their transformations<lb/>
Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,<lb/>
Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires<lb/>
Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts<lb/>
Burn hotter than my faith.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p>O, but, sir,<lb/>
Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis<lb/>
Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:<lb/>
One of these two must be necessities,<lb/>
Which then will speak, that you must<lb/>
change this purpose,<lb/>
Or I my life.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>Thou dearest Perdita,<lb/>
With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not<lb/>
The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,<lb/>
Or not my father's. For I cannot be<lb/>
Mine own, nor any thing to any, if<lb/>
I be not thine. To this I am most constant,<lb/>
Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;<lb/>
Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing<lb/>
That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:<lb/>
Lift up your countenance, as it were the day<lb/>
Of celebration of that nuptial which<lb/>
We two have sworn shall come.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p>O lady Fortune,<lb/>
Stand you auspicious!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>See, your guests approach:<lb/>
Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,<lb/>
And let's be red with mirth.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Shepherd, Clown, MOPSA, DORCAS, and	others, with POLIXENES and CAMILLO disguised</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon<lb/>
This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,<lb/>
Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;<lb/>
Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,<lb/>
At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;<lb/>
On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire<lb/>
With labour and the thing she took to quench it,<lb/>
She would to each one sip. You are retired,<lb/>
As if you were a feasted one and not<lb/>
The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid<lb/>
These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is<lb/>
A way to make us better friends, more known.<lb/>
Come, quench your blushes and present yourself<lb/>
That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,<lb/>
And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,<lb/>
As your good flock shall prosper.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p><stage>[To POLIXENES]</stage></p><p>                  Sir, welcome:<lb/>
It is my father's will I should take on me<lb/>
The hostess-ship o' the day.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To CAMILLO</stage></p>


<p>
You're welcome, sir.<lb/>
Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,<lb/>
For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep<lb/>
Seeming and savour all the winter long:<lb/>
Grace and remembrance be to you both,<lb/>
And welcome to our shearing!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>Shepherdess,<lb/>
A fair one are you&mdash;well you fit our ages<lb/>
With flowers of winter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p>Sir, the year growing ancient,<lb/>
Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth<lb/>
Of trembling winter, the fairest<lb/>
flowers o' the season<lb/>
Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,<lb/>
Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind<lb/>
Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not<lb/>
To get slips of them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>Wherefore, gentle maiden,<lb/>
Do you neglect them?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p>For I have heard it said<lb/>
There is an art which in their piedness shares<lb/>
With great creating nature.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>Say there be;<lb/>
Yet nature is made better by no mean<lb/>
But nature makes that mean: so, over that art<lb/>
Which you say adds to nature, is an art<lb/>
That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry<lb/>
A gentler scion to the wildest stock,<lb/>
And make conceive a bark of baser kind<lb/>
By bud of nobler race: this is an art<lb/>
Which does mend nature, change it rather, but<lb/>
The art itself is nature.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p>So it is.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,<lb/>
And do not call them bastards.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p>I'll not put<lb/>
The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;<lb/>
No more than were I painted I would wish<lb/>
This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore<lb/>
Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;<lb/>
Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;<lb/>
The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun<lb/>
And with him rises weeping: these are flowers<lb/>
Of middle summer, and I think they are given<lb/>
To men of middle age. You're very welcome.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,<lb/>
And only live by gazing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p>Out, alas!<lb/>
You'd be so lean, that blasts of January<lb/>
Would blow you through and through.<lb/>
Now, my fair'st friend,<lb/>
I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might<lb/>
Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,<lb/>
That wear upon your virgin branches yet<lb/>
Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,<lb/>
For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall<lb/>
From Dis's waggon! daffodils,<lb/>
That come before the swallow dares, and take<lb/>
The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,<lb/>
But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes<lb/>
Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses<lb/>
That die unmarried, ere they can behold<lb/>
Bight Phoebus in his strength&mdash;a malady<lb/>
Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and<lb/>
The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,<lb/>
The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,<lb/>
To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,<lb/>
To strew him o'er and o'er!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>What, like a corse?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p>No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;<lb/>
Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,<lb/>
But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:<lb/>
Methinks I play as I have seen them do<lb/>
In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine<lb/>
Does change my disposition.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>What you do<lb/>
Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.<lb/>
I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,<lb/>
I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,<lb/>
Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,<lb/>
To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you<lb/>
A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do<lb/>
Nothing but that; move still, still so,<lb/>
And own no other function: each your doing,<lb/>
So singular in each particular,<lb/>
Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,<lb/>
That all your acts are queens.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p>O Doricles,<lb/>
Your praises are too large: but that your youth,<lb/>
And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,<lb/>
Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,<lb/>
With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,<lb/>
You woo'd me the false way.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>I think you have<lb/>
As little skill to fear as I have purpose<lb/>
To put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:<lb/>
Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,<lb/>
That never mean to part.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p>I'll swear for 'em.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever<lb/>
Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems<lb/>
But smacks of something greater than herself,<lb/>
Too noble for this place.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>He tells her something<lb/>
That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is<lb/>
The queen of curds and cream.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Come on, strike up!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DORCAS</speaker>
<p>Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,<lb/>
To mend her kissing with!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOPSA</speaker>
<p>Now, in good time!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.<lb/>
Come, strike up!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Music. Here a dance of Shepherds and	Shepherdesses</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this<lb/>
Which dances with your daughter?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>They call him Doricles; and boasts himself<lb/>
To have a worthy feeding: but I have it<lb/>
Upon his own report and I believe it;<lb/>
He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:<lb/>
I think so too; for never gazed the moon<lb/>
Upon the water as he'll stand and read<lb/>
As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.<lb/>
I think there is not half a kiss to choose<lb/>
Who loves another best.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>She dances featly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>So she does any thing; though I report it,<lb/>
That should be silent: if young Doricles<lb/>
Do light upon her, she shall bring him that<lb/>
Which he not dreams of.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Servant</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the<lb/>
door, you would never dance again after a tabour and<lb/>
pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings<lb/>
several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he<lb/>
utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's<lb/>
ears grew to his tunes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>He could never come better; he shall come in. I<lb/>
love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful<lb/>
matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing<lb/>
indeed and sung lamentably.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no<lb/>
milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he<lb/>
has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without<lb/>
bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate<lb/>
burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump<lb/>
her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,<lb/>
as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into<lb/>
the matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me<lb/>
no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with<lb/>
'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>This is a brave fellow.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited<lb/>
fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;<lb/>

learnedly handle, though they come to him by the<lb/>

Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take<lb/>
no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it<lb/>
will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOPSA</speaker>
<p>I was promised them against the feast; but they come<lb/>
not too late now.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DORCAS</speaker>
<p>He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOPSA</speaker>
<p>He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has<lb/>
paid you more, which will shame you to give him again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Is there no manners left among maids? will they<lb/>
wear their plackets where they should bear their<lb/>
faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are<lb/>
going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these<lb/>
secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all<lb/>
our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour<lb/>
your tongues, and not a word more.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOPSA</speaker>
<p>I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace<lb/>
and a pair of sweet gloves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way<lb/>
and lost all my money?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;<lb/>
therefore it behoves men to be wary.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>What hast here? ballads?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOPSA</speaker>
<p>Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'<lb/>
life, for then we are sure they are true.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's<lb/>
wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a<lb/>
burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and<lb/>
toads carbonadoed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOPSA</speaker>
<p>Is it true, think you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Very true, and but a month old.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DORCAS</speaker>
<p>Bless me from marrying a usurer!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress<lb/>
Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were<lb/>
present. Why should I carry lies abroad?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOPSA</speaker>
<p>Pray you now, buy it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe<lb/>
ballads; we'll buy the other things anon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon<lb/>
the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,<lb/>
forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this<lb/>
ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was<lb/>
thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold<lb/>
fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that<lb/>
loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DORCAS</speaker>
<p>Is it true too, think you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than<lb/>
my pack will hold.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Lay it by too: another.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOPSA</speaker>
<p>Let's have some merry ones.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to<lb/>
the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's<lb/>
scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in<lb/>
request, I can tell you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOPSA</speaker>
<p>We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou<lb/>
shalt hear; 'tis in three parts.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DORCAS</speaker>
<p>We had the tune on't a month ago.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my<lb/>
occupation; have at it with you.<lb/>

<p>O, whither?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DORCAS</speaker>
<p>Whither?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MOPSA</speaker>
<p>It becomes thy oath full well,<lb/>
Thou to me thy secrets tell.<lb/>

<p>Me too, let me go thither.<lb/>

<p>Or thou goest to the orange or mill.<lb/>

<p>Neither.<lb/>

<p>What, neither?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Neither.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DORCAS</speaker>
<p>Thou hast sworn my love to be.<lb/>

<p>Thou hast sworn it more to me:<lb/>
Then whither goest? say, whither?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my<lb/>
father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll<lb/>
not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after<lb/>
me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let's<lb/>
have the first choice. Follow me, girls.<lb/>

Will you buy any tape,<lb/>
Or lace for your cape,<lb/>
My dainty duck, my dear-a?<lb/>
Any silk, any thread,<lb/>
Any toys for your head,<lb/>
Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter Servant</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Master, there is three carters, three shepherds,<lb/>
three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made<lb/>
themselves all men of hair, they call themselves<lb/>
Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches<lb/>
say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are<lb/>
not in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if it<lb/>
be not too rough for some that know little but<lb/>
bowling, it will please plentifully.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much<lb/>
homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see<lb/>
these four threes of herdsmen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath<lb/>
danced before the king; and not the worst of the<lb/>
three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Leave your prating: since these good men are<lb/>
pleased, let them come in; but quickly now.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Why, they stay at door, sir.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p><p><stage>Here a dance of twelve Satyrs</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>To CAMILLO</stage></p>


<p>
Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.<lb/>
He's simple and tells much.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To FLORIZEL</stage></p>


<p>
How now, fair shepherd!<lb/>
Your heart is full of something that does take<lb/>
Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young<lb/>
And handed love as you do, I was wont<lb/>
To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd<lb/>
The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it<lb/>
To her acceptance; you have let him go<lb/>
And nothing marted with him. If your lass<lb/>
Interpretation should abuse and call this<lb/>
Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited<lb/>
For a reply, at least if you make a care<lb/>
Of happy holding her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>Old sir, I know<lb/>
She prizes not such trifles as these are:<lb/>
The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd<lb/>
Up in my heart; which I have given already,<lb/>
But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life<lb/>
Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,<lb/>
Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,<lb/>
As soft as dove's down and as white as it,<lb/>
Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd<lb/>
snow that's bolted<lb/>
By the northern blasts twice o'er.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>What follows this?<lb/>
How prettily the young swain seems to wash<lb/>
The hand was fair before! I have put you out:<lb/>
But to your protestation; let me hear<lb/>
What you profess.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>Do, and be witness to 't.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>And this my neighbour too?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>And he, and more<lb/>
Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:<lb/>
That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,<lb/>
Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth<lb/>
That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge<lb/>
More than was ever man's, I would not prize them<lb/>
Without her love; for her employ them all;<lb/>
Commend them and condemn them to her service<lb/>
Or to their own perdition.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>Fairly offer'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>This shows a sound affection.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>But, my daughter,<lb/>
Say you the like to him?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p>I cannot speak<lb/>
So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:<lb/>
By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out<lb/>
The purity of his.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Take hands, a bargain!<lb/>
And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:<lb/>
I give my daughter to him, and will make<lb/>
Her portion equal his.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>O, that must be<lb/>
I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,<lb/>
I shall have more than you can dream of yet;<lb/>
Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,<lb/>
Contract us 'fore these witnesses.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Come, your hand;<lb/>
And, daughter, yours.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;<lb/>
Have you a father?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>I have: but what of him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>Knows he of this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>He neither does nor shall.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>Methinks a father<lb/>
Is at the nuptial of his son a guest<lb/>
That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,<lb/>
Is not your father grown incapable<lb/>
Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid<lb/>
With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?<lb/>
Know man from man? dispute his own estate?<lb/>
Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing<lb/>
But what he did being childish?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>No, good sir;<lb/>
He has his health and ampler strength indeed<lb/>
Than most have of his age.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>By my white beard,<lb/>
You offer him, if this be so, a wrong<lb/>
Something unfilial: reason my son<lb/>
Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason<lb/>
The father, all whose joy is nothing else<lb/>
But fair posterity, should hold some counsel<lb/>
In such a business.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>I yield all this;<lb/>
But for some other reasons, my grave sir,<lb/>
Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint<lb/>
My father of this business.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>Let him know't.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>He shall not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>Prithee, let him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>No, he must not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve<lb/>
At knowing of thy choice.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>Come, come, he must not.<lb/>
Mark our contract.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>Mark your divorce, young sir,<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Discovering himself</stage></p>


<p>
Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base<lb/>
To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,<lb/>
That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,<lb/>
I am sorry that by hanging thee I can<lb/>
But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece<lb/>
Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know<lb/>
The royal fool thou copest with,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>O, my heart!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made<lb/>
More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,<lb/>
If I may ever know thou dost but sigh<lb/>
That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never<lb/>
I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;<lb/>
Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,<lb/>
Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:<lb/>
Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,<lb/>
Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee<lb/>
From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.&mdash;<lb/>
Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,<lb/>
That makes himself, but for our honour therein,<lb/>
Unworthy thee,&mdash;if ever henceforth thou<lb/>
These rural latches to his entrance open,<lb/>
Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,<lb/>
I will devise a death as cruel for thee<lb/>
As thou art tender to't.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p>Even here undone!<lb/>
I was not much afeard; for once or twice<lb/>
I was about to speak and tell him plainly,<lb/>
The selfsame sun that shines upon his court<lb/>
Hides not his visage from our cottage but<lb/>
Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?<lb/>
I told you what would come of this: beseech you,<lb/>
Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,&mdash;<lb/>
Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,<lb/>
But milk my ewes and weep.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Why, how now, father!<lb/>
Speak ere thou diest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>I cannot speak, nor think<lb/>
Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!<lb/>
You have undone a man of fourscore three,<lb/>
That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,<lb/>
To die upon the bed my father died,<lb/>
To lie close by his honest bones: but now<lb/>
Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me<lb/>
Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,<lb/>
That knew'st this was the prince,<lb/>
and wouldst adventure<lb/>
To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!<lb/>
If I might die within this hour, I have lived<lb/>
To die when I desire.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>Why look you so upon me?<lb/>
I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,<lb/>
But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;<lb/>
More straining on for plucking back, not following<lb/>
My leash unwillingly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Gracious my lord,<lb/>
You know your father's temper: at this time<lb/>
He will allow no speech, which I do guess<lb/>
You do not purpose to him; and as hardly<lb/>
Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:<lb/>
Then, till the fury of his highness settle,<lb/>
Come not before him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>I not purpose it.<lb/>
I think, Camillo?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Even he, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p>How often have I told you 'twould be thus!<lb/>
How often said, my dignity would last<lb/>
But till 'twere known!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>It cannot fail but by<lb/>
The violation of my faith; and then<lb/>
Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together<lb/>
And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:<lb/>
From my succession wipe me, father; I<lb/>
Am heir to my affection.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Be advised.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>I am, and by my fancy: if my reason<lb/>
Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;<lb/>
If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,<lb/>
Do bid it welcome.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>This is desperate, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;<lb/>
I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,<lb/>
Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may<lb/>
Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or<lb/>
The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides<lb/>
In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath<lb/>
To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,<lb/>
As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,<lb/>
When he shall miss me,&mdash;as, in faith, I mean not<lb/>
To see him any more,&mdash;cast your good counsels<lb/>
Upon his passion; let myself and fortune<lb/>
Tug for the time to come. This you may know<lb/>
And so deliver, I am put to sea<lb/>
With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;<lb/>
And most opportune to our need I have<lb/>
A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared<lb/>
For this design. What course I mean to hold<lb/>
Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor<lb/>
Concern me the reporting.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>O my lord!<lb/>
I would your spirit were easier for advice,<lb/>
Or stronger for your need.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>Hark, Perdita<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Drawing her aside</stage></p>


<p>
I'll hear you by and by.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>He's irremoveable,<lb/>
Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if<lb/>
His going I could frame to serve my turn,<lb/>
Save him from danger, do him love and honour,<lb/>
Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia<lb/>
And that unhappy king, my master, whom<lb/>
I so much thirst to see.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>Now, good Camillo;<lb/>
I am so fraught with curious business that<lb/>
I leave out ceremony.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Sir, I think<lb/>
You have heard of my poor services, i' the love<lb/>
That I have borne your father?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>Very nobly<lb/>
Have you deserved: it is my father's music<lb/>
To speak your deeds, not little of his care<lb/>
To have them recompensed as thought on.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Well, my lord,<lb/>
If you may please to think I love the king<lb/>
And through him what is nearest to him, which is<lb/>
Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:<lb/>
If your more ponderous and settled project<lb/>
May suffer alteration, on mine honour,<lb/>
I'll point you where you shall have such receiving<lb/>
As shall become your highness; where you may<lb/>
Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,<lb/>
There's no disjunction to be made, but by&mdash;<lb/>
As heavens forefend!&mdash;your ruin; marry her,<lb/>
And, with my best endeavours in your absence,<lb/>
Your discontenting father strive to qualify<lb/>
And bring him up to liking.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>How, Camillo,<lb/>
May this, almost a miracle, be done?<lb/>
That I may call thee something more than man<lb/>
And after that trust to thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Have you thought on<lb/>
A place whereto you'll go?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>Not any yet:<lb/>
But as the unthought-on accident is guilty<lb/>
To what we wildly do, so we profess<lb/>
Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies<lb/>
Of every wind that blows.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Then list to me:<lb/>
This follows, if you will not change your purpose<lb/>
But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,<lb/>
And there present yourself and your fair princess,<lb/>
For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:<lb/>
She shall be habited as it becomes<lb/>
The partner of your bed. Methinks I see<lb/>
Leontes opening his free arms and weeping<lb/>
His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,<lb/>
As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands<lb/>
Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him<lb/>
'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one<lb/>
He chides to hell and bids the other grow<lb/>
Faster than thought or time.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>Worthy Camillo,<lb/>
What colour for my visitation shall I<lb/>
Hold up before him?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Sent by the king your father<lb/>
To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,<lb/>
The manner of your bearing towards him, with<lb/>
What you as from your father shall deliver,<lb/>
Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:<lb/>
The which shall point you forth at every sitting<lb/>
What you must say; that he shall not perceive<lb/>
But that you have your father's bosom there<lb/>
And speak his very heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>I am bound to you:<lb/>
There is some sap in this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>A cause more promising<lb/>
Than a wild dedication of yourselves<lb/>
To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain<lb/>
To miseries enough; no hope to help you,<lb/>
But as you shake off one to take another;<lb/>
Nothing so certain as your anchors, who<lb/>
Do their best office, if they can but stay you<lb/>
Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know<lb/>
Prosperity's the very bond of love,<lb/>
Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together<lb/>
Affliction alters.<lb/>

<p>One of these is true:<lb/>
I think affliction may subdue the cheek,<lb/>
But not take in the mind.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Yea, say you so?<lb/>
There shall not at your father's house these<lb/>
seven years<lb/>
Be born another such.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>My good Camillo,<lb/>
She is as forward of her breeding as<lb/>
She is i' the rear our birth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>I cannot say 'tis pity<lb/>
She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress<lb/>
To most that teach.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p>Your pardon, sir; for this<lb/>
I'll blush you thanks.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>My prettiest Perdita!<lb/>
But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,<lb/>
Preserver of my father, now of me,<lb/>
The medicine of our house, how shall we do?<lb/>
We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,<lb/>
Nor shall appear in Sicilia.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>My lord,<lb/>
Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes<lb/>
Do all lie there: it shall be so my care<lb/>
To have you royally appointed as if<lb/>
The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,<lb/>
That you may know you shall not want, one word.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his<lb/>
sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold<lb/>
all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a<lb/>
ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,<lb/>
knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,<lb/>
to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who<lb/>
should buy first, as if my trinkets had been<lb/>
hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:<lb/>
by which means I saw whose purse was best in<lb/>
picture; and what I saw, to my good use I<lb/>
remembered. My clown, who wants but something to<lb/>
be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the<lb/>
wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes<lb/>
till he had both tune and words; which so drew the<lb/>
rest of the herd to me that all their other senses<lb/>
stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it<lb/>
was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a<lb/>
purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in<lb/>
chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,<lb/>
and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this<lb/>
time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their<lb/>
festival purses; and had not the old man come in<lb/>
with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's<lb/>
son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not<lb/>
left a purse alive in the whole army.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>CAMILLO, FLORIZEL, and PERDITA come forward</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Nay, but my letters, by this means being there<lb/>
So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>And those that you'll procure from King Leontes&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Shall satisfy your father.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear<lb/>
not, man; here's no harm intended to thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>I am a poor fellow, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from<lb/>
thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must<lb/>
make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,<lb/>
&mdash;thou must think there's a necessity in't,&mdash;and<lb/>
change garments with this gentleman: though the<lb/>
pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,<lb/>
there's some boot.<lb/>

I know ye well enough.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Are you in earnest, sir?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
I smell the trick on't.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments</stage></p>


<p>
Fortunate mistress,&mdash;let my prophecy<lb/>
Come home to ye!&mdash;you must retire yourself<lb/>
Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat<lb/>
And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,<lb/>
Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken<lb/>
The truth of your own seeming; that you may&mdash;<lb/>
For I do fear eyes over&mdash;to shipboard<lb/>
Get undescried.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p>I see the play so lies<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>Should I now meet my father,<lb/>

Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Adieu, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!<lb/>
Pray you, a word.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  What I do next, shall be to tell the king<lb/>
Of this escape and whither they are bound;<lb/>
Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail<lb/>
To force him after: in whose company<lb/>
I shall review Sicilia, for whose sight<lb/>
I have a woman's longing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>Fortune speed us!<lb/>
Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>The swifter speed the better.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt FLORIZEL, PERDITA, and CAMILLO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>I understand the business, I hear it: to have an<lb/>
open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is<lb/>
necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite<lb/>
also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see<lb/>
this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.<lb/>
What an exchange had this been without boot! What<lb/>
a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do<lb/>
this year connive at us, and we may do any thing<lb/>
extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of<lb/>
iniquity, stealing away from his father with his<lb/>
clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of<lb/>
honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not<lb/>
do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;<lb/>
and therein am I constant to my profession.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter Clown and Shepherd</stage></p>


<p>
Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:<lb/>
every lane's end, every shop, church, session,<lb/>
hanging, yields a careful man work.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>See, see; what a man you are now!<lb/>
There is no other way but to tell the king<lb/>
she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Nay, but hear me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Nay, but hear me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Go to, then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh<lb/>
and blood has not offended the king; and so your<lb/>
flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show<lb/>
those things you found about her, those secret<lb/>
things, all but what she has with her: this being<lb/>
done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his<lb/>
son's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,<lb/>
neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make<lb/>
me the king's brother-in-law.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you<lb/>

<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Very wisely, puppies!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Well, let us to the king: there is that in this<lb/>

<p>
How now, rustics! whither are you bound?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>To the palace, an it like your worship.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition<lb/>
of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your<lb/>
names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any<lb/>
thing that is fitting to be known, discover.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>We are but plain fellows, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no<lb/>
lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they<lb/>
often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for<lb/>
it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore<lb/>
they do not give us the lie.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Your worship had like to have given us one, if you<lb/>
had not taken yourself with the manner.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest<lb/>
thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?<lb/>
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?<lb/>
receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I<lb/>
not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,<lb/>
for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy<lb/>
business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier<lb/>
cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck<lb/>
back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to<lb/>
open thy affair.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>My business, sir, is to the king.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>What advocate hast thou to him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>I know not, an't like you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you<lb/>
have none.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>How blessed are we that are not simple men!<lb/>
Yet nature might have made me as these are,<lb/>
Therefore I will not disdain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>This cannot be but a great courtier.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>His garments are rich, but he wears<lb/>
them not handsomely.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:<lb/>
a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking<lb/>
on's teeth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?<lb/>
Wherefore that box?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,<lb/>
which none must know but the king; and which he<lb/>
shall know within this hour, if I may come to the<lb/>
speech of him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Age, thou hast lost thy labour.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Why, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a<lb/>
new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,<lb/>
if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must<lb/>
know the king is full of grief.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepard</speaker>
<p>So 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have<lb/>
married a shepherd's daughter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:<lb/>
the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall<lb/>
feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Think you so, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy<lb/>
and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to<lb/>
him, though removed fifty times, shall all come<lb/>
under the hangman: which though it be great pity,<lb/>
yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a<lb/>
ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into<lb/>
grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death<lb/>
is too soft for him, say I	draw our throne into a<lb/>
sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't<lb/>
like you, sir?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then<lb/>
'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a<lb/>
wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters<lb/>
and a dram dead; then recovered again with<lb/>
aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as<lb/>
he is, and in the hottest day prognostication<lb/>
proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the<lb/>
sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he<lb/>
is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what<lb/>
talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries<lb/>
are to be smiled at, their offences being so<lb/>
capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain<lb/>
men, what you have to the king: being something<lb/>
gently considered, I'll bring you where he is<lb/>
aboard, tender your persons to his presence,<lb/>
whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man<lb/>
besides the king to effect your suits, here is man<lb/>
shall do it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>He seems to be of great authority: close with him,<lb/>
give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn<lb/>
bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show<lb/>
the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,<lb/>
and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for<lb/>
us, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much<lb/>
more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>After I have done what I promised?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Ay, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful<lb/>
one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,<lb/>
he'll be made an example.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show<lb/>
our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your<lb/>
daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I<lb/>
will give you as much as this old man does when the<lb/>
business is performed, and remain, as he says, your<lb/>
pawn till it be brought you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;<lb/>
go on the right hand: I will but look upon the<lb/>
hedge and follow you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt Shepherd and Clown</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would<lb/>
not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am<lb/>
courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means<lb/>
to do the prince my master good; which who knows how<lb/>
that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring<lb/>
these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he<lb/>
think it fit to shore them again and that the<lb/>
complaint they have to the king concerns him<lb/>
nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far<lb/>
officious; for I am proof against that title and<lb/>
what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present<lb/>
them: there may be matter in it.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter LEONTES, CLEOMENES, DION, PAULINA, and Servants</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>CLEOMENES</speaker>
<p>Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd<lb/>
A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,<lb/>
Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down<lb/>
More penitence than done trespass: at the last,<lb/>
Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;<lb/>
With them forgive yourself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Whilst I remember<lb/>
Her and her virtues, I cannot forget<lb/>
My blemishes in them, and so still think of<lb/>
The wrong I did myself; which was so much,<lb/>
That heirless it hath made my kingdom and<lb/>
Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man<lb/>
Bred his hopes out of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>True, too true, my lord:<lb/>
If, one by one, you wedded all the world,<lb/>
Or from the all that are took something good,<lb/>
To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd<lb/>
Would be unparallel'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>I think so. Kill'd!<lb/>
She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me<lb/>
Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter<lb/>
Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,<lb/>
Say so but seldom.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOMENES</speaker>
<p>Not at all, good lady:<lb/>
You might have spoken a thousand things that would<lb/>
Have done the time more benefit and graced<lb/>
Your kindness better.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>You are one of those<lb/>
Would have him wed again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DION</speaker>
<p>If you would not so,<lb/>
You pity not the state, nor the remembrance<lb/>
Of his most sovereign name; consider little<lb/>
What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,<lb/>
May drop upon his kingdom and devour<lb/>
Incertain lookers on. What were more holy<lb/>
Than to rejoice the former queen is well?<lb/>
What holier than, for royalty's repair,<lb/>
For present comfort and for future good,<lb/>
To bless the bed of majesty again<lb/>
With a sweet fellow to't?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>There is none worthy,<lb/>
Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods<lb/>
Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;<lb/>
For has not the divine Apollo said,<lb/>
Is't not the tenor of his oracle,<lb/>
That King Leontes shall not have an heir<lb/>
Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,<lb/>
Is all as monstrous to our human reason<lb/>
As my Antigonus to break his grave<lb/>
And come again to me; who, on my life,<lb/>
Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel<lb/>
My lord should to the heavens be contrary,<lb/>
Oppose against their wills.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To LEONTES</stage></p>


<p>
Care not for issue;<lb/>
The crown will find an heir: great Alexander<lb/>
Left his to the worthiest; so his successor<lb/>
Was like to be the best.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Good Paulina,<lb/>
Who hast the memory of Hermione,<lb/>
I know, in honour, O, that ever I<lb/>
Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,<lb/>
I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,<lb/>
Have taken treasure from her lips&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>And left them<lb/>
More rich for what they yielded.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Thou speak'st truth.<lb/>
No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,<lb/>
And better used, would make her sainted spirit<lb/>
Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,<lb/>
Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,<lb/>
And begin, 'Why to me?'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>Had she such power,<lb/>
She had just cause.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>She had; and would incense me<lb/>
To murder her I married.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>I should so.<lb/>
Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark<lb/>
Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't<lb/>
You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears<lb/>
Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd<lb/>
Should be 'Remember mine.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Stars, stars,<lb/>
And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;<lb/>
I'll have no wife, Paulina.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>Will you swear<lb/>
Never to marry but by my free leave?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOMENES</speaker>
<p>You tempt him over-much.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>Unless another,<lb/>
As like Hermione as is her picture,<lb/>
Affront his eye.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEOMENES</speaker>
<p>Good madam,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>I have done.<lb/>
Yet, if my lord will marry,&mdash;if you will, sir,<lb/>
No remedy, but you will,&mdash;give me the office<lb/>
To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young<lb/>
As was your former; but she shall be such<lb/>
As, walk'd your first queen's ghost,<lb/>
it should take joy<lb/>
To see her in your arms.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>My true Paulina,<lb/>
We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.<lb/>

Like to his father's greatness: his approach,<lb/>
So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us<lb/>
'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced<lb/>
By need and accident. What train?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gentleman</speaker>
<p>But few,<lb/>
And those but mean.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>His princess, say you, with him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,<lb/>
That e'er the sun shone bright on.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>O Hermione,<lb/>
As every present time doth boast itself<lb/>
Above a better gone, so must thy grave<lb/>
Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself<lb/>
Have said and writ so, but your writing now<lb/>
Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,<lb/>
Nor was not to be equall'd;'&mdash;thus your verse<lb/>
Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,<lb/>
To say you have seen a better.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Pardon, madam:<lb/>
The one I have almost forgot,&mdash;your pardon,&mdash;<lb/>
The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,<lb/>
Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,<lb/>
Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal<lb/>
Of all professors else, make proselytes<lb/>
Of who she but bid follow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>How! not women?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Women will love her, that she is a woman<lb/>
More worth than any man; men, that she is<lb/>
The rarest of all women.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Go, Cleomenes;<lb/>
Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,<lb/>
Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt CLEOMENES and others</stage></p>


<p>
He thus should steal upon us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>Had our prince,<lb/>
Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd<lb/>
Well with this lord: there was not full a month<lb/>
Between their births.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st<lb/>
He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,<lb/>
When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches<lb/>
Will bring me to consider that which may<lb/>
Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter CLEOMENES and others, with FLORIZEL and PERDITA</stage></p>


<p>
Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;<lb/>
For she did print your royal father off,<lb/>
Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,<lb/>
Your father's image is so hit in you,<lb/>
His very air, that I should call you brother,<lb/>
As I did him, and speak of something wildly<lb/>
By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!<lb/>
And your fair princess,&mdash;goddess!&mdash;O, alas!<lb/>
I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth<lb/>
Might thus have stood begetting wonder as<lb/>
You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost&mdash;<lb/>
All mine own folly&mdash;the society,<lb/>
Amity too, of your brave father, whom,<lb/>
Though bearing misery, I desire my life<lb/>
Once more to look on him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>By his command<lb/>
Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him<lb/>
Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,<lb/>
Can send his brother: and, but infirmity<lb/>
Which waits upon worn times hath something seized<lb/>
His wish'd ability, he had himself<lb/>
The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his<lb/>
Measured to look upon you; whom he loves&mdash;<lb/>
He bade me say so&mdash;more than all the sceptres<lb/>
And those that bear them living.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>O my brother,<lb/>
Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir<lb/>
Afresh within me, and these thy offices,<lb/>
So rarely kind, are as interpreters<lb/>
Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,<lb/>
As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too<lb/>
Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,<lb/>
At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,<lb/>
To greet a man not worth her pains, much less<lb/>
The adventure of her person?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>Good my lord,<lb/>
She came from Libya.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Where the warlike Smalus,<lb/>
That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter<lb/>
His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,<lb/>
A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,<lb/>
To execute the charge my father gave me<lb/>
For visiting your highness: my best train<lb/>
I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;<lb/>
Who for Bohemia bend, to signify<lb/>
Not only my success in Libya, sir,<lb/>
But my arrival and my wife's in safety<lb/>
Here where we are.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>The blessed gods<lb/>
Purge all infection from our air whilst you<lb/>
Do climate here! You have a holy father,<lb/>
A graceful gentleman; against whose person,<lb/>
So sacred as it is, I have done sin:<lb/>
For which the heavens, taking angry note,<lb/>
Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,<lb/>
As he from heaven merits it, with you<lb/>
Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,<lb/>
Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,<lb/>
Such goodly things as you!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Lord</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord</speaker>
<p>Most noble sir,<lb/>
That which I shall report will bear no credit,<lb/>
Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,<lb/>
Bohemia greets you from himself by me;<lb/>
Desires you to attach his son, who has&mdash;<lb/>
His dignity and duty both cast off&mdash;<lb/>
Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with<lb/>
A shepherd's daughter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Where's Bohemia? speak.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord</speaker>
<p>Here in your city; I now came from him:<lb/>
I speak amazedly; and it becomes<lb/>
My marvel and my message. To your court<lb/>
Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,<lb/>
Of this fair couple, meets he on the way<lb/>
The father of this seeming lady and<lb/>
Her brother, having both their country quitted<lb/>
With this young prince.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>Camillo has betray'd me;<lb/>
Whose honour and whose honesty till now<lb/>
Endured all weathers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord</speaker>
<p>Lay't so to his charge:<lb/>
He's with the king your father.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Who? Camillo?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord</speaker>
<p>Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now<lb/>
Has these poor men in question. Never saw I<lb/>
Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;<lb/>
Forswear themselves as often as they speak:<lb/>
Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them<lb/>
With divers deaths in death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p>O my poor father!<lb/>
The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have<lb/>
Our contract celebrated.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>You are married?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;<lb/>
The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:<lb/>
The odds for high and low's alike.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>My lord,<lb/>
Is this the daughter of a king?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>She is,<lb/>
When once she is my wife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>That 'once' I see by your good father's speed<lb/>
Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,<lb/>
Most sorry, you have broken from his liking<lb/>
Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry<lb/>
Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,<lb/>
That you might well enjoy her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FLORIZEL</speaker>
<p>Dear, look up:<lb/>
Though Fortune, visible an enemy,<lb/>
Should chase us with my father, power no jot<lb/>
Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,<lb/>
Remember since you owed no more to time<lb/>
Than I do now: with thought of such affections,<lb/>
Step forth mine advocate; at your request<lb/>
My father will grant precious things as trifles.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,<lb/>
Which he counts but a trifle.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>Sir, my liege,<lb/>
Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month<lb/>
'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes<lb/>
Than what you look on now.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>I thought of her,<lb/>
Even in these looks I made.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To FLORIZEL</stage></p>


<p>
But your petition<lb/>
Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:<lb/>
Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,<lb/>
I am friend to them and you: upon which errand<lb/>
I now go toward him; therefore follow me<lb/>
And mark what way I make: come, good my lord.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>



</p></div2><div2 type="scene" n="2" id="d21">
<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>Before LEONTES' palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old<lb/>
shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:<lb/>
whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all<lb/>
commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I<lb/>
heard the shepherd say, he found the child.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>I would most gladly know the issue of it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>I make a broken delivery of the business; but the<lb/>
changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were<lb/>
very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with<lb/>
staring on one another, to tear the cases of their<lb/>
eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language<lb/>
in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard<lb/>
of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable<lb/>
passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest<lb/>
beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not<lb/>
say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the<lb/>
extremity of the one, it must needs be.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter another Gentleman</stage></p>


<p>
Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.<lb/>
The news, Rogero?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the<lb/>
king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is<lb/>
broken out within this hour that ballad-makers<lb/>
cannot be able to express it.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a third Gentleman</stage></p>


<p>
Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can<lb/>
deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news<lb/>
which is called true is so like an old tale, that<lb/>
the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king<lb/>
found his heir?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by<lb/>
circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you<lb/>
see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle<lb/>
of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,<lb/>
the letters of Antigonus found with it which they<lb/>
know to be his character, the majesty of the<lb/>
creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection<lb/>
of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,<lb/>
and many other evidences proclaim her with all<lb/>
certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see<lb/>
the meeting of the two kings?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>No.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,<lb/>
cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one<lb/>
joy crown another, so and in such manner that it<lb/>
seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their<lb/>
joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,<lb/>
holding up of hands, with countenances of such<lb/>
distraction that they were to be known by garment,<lb/>
not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of<lb/>
himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that<lb/>
joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,<lb/>
thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then<lb/>
embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his<lb/>
daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old<lb/>
shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten<lb/>
conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such<lb/>
another encounter, which lames report to follow it<lb/>
and undoes description to do it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried<lb/>
hence the child?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Like an old tale still, which will have matter to<lb/>
rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear<lb/>
open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this<lb/>
avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his<lb/>
innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a<lb/>
handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>What became of his bark and his followers?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and<lb/>
in the view of the shepherd: so that all the<lb/>
instruments which aided to expose the child were<lb/>
even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble<lb/>
combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in<lb/>
Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of<lb/>
her husband, another elevated that the oracle was<lb/>
fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,<lb/>
and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin<lb/>
her to her heart that she might no more be in danger<lb/>
of losing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>The dignity of this act was worth the audience of<lb/>
kings and princes; for by such was it acted.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Gentleman</speaker>
<p>One of the prettiest touches of all and that which<lb/>
angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not<lb/>
the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's<lb/>
death, with the manner how she came to't bravely<lb/>
confessed and lamented by the king, how<lb/>
attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one<lb/>
sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'<lb/>
I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my<lb/>
heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed<lb/>
colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world<lb/>
could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Are they returned to the court?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Gentleman</speaker>
<p>No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,<lb/>
which is in the keeping of Paulina,&mdash;a piece many<lb/>
years in doing and now newly performed by that rare<lb/>
Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself<lb/>
eternity and could put breath into his work, would<lb/>
beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her<lb/>
ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that<lb/>
they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of<lb/>
answer: thither with all greediness of affection<lb/>
are they gone, and there they intend to sup.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>I thought she had some great matter there in hand;<lb/>
for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever<lb/>
since the death of Hermione, visited that removed<lb/>
house. Shall we thither and with our company piece<lb/>
the rejoicing?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?<lb/>
every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:<lb/>
our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.<lb/>
Let's along.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt Gentlemen</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,<lb/>
would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old<lb/>
man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard<lb/>
them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he<lb/>
at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,<lb/>
so he then took her to be, who began to be much<lb/>
sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of<lb/>
weather continuing, this mystery remained<lb/>
undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I<lb/>
been the finder out of this secret, it would not<lb/>
have relished among my other discredits.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Shepherd and Clown</stage></p>


<p>
Here come those I have done good to against my will,<lb/>
and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and<lb/>
daughters will be all gentlemen born.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me<lb/>
this other day, because I was no gentleman born.<lb/>
See you these clothes? say you see them not and<lb/>
think me still no gentleman born: you were best say<lb/>
these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the<lb/>
lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>And so have I, boy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my<lb/>
father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and<lb/>
called me brother; and then the two kings called my<lb/>
father brother; and then the prince my brother and<lb/>
the princess my sister called my father father; and<lb/>
so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like<lb/>
tears that ever we shed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>We may live, son, to shed many more.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so<lb/>
preposterous estate as we are.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the<lb/>
faults I have committed to your worship and to give<lb/>
me your good report to the prince my master.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are<lb/>
gentlemen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Thou wilt amend thy life?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, an it like your good worship.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou<lb/>
art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>You may say it, but not swear it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and<lb/>
franklins say it, I'll swear it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Shepherd</speaker>
<p>How if it be false, son?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear<lb/>
it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to<lb/>
the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and<lb/>
that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no<lb/>
tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be<lb/>
drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst<lb/>
be a tall fellow of thy hands.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AUTOLYCUS</speaker>
<p>I will prove so, sir, to my power.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Clown</speaker>
<p>Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not<lb/>
wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not<lb/>
being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings<lb/>
and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the<lb/>
queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy<lb/>
good masters.<lb/>

<p><stage>A chapel in PAULINA'S house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter LEONTES, POLIXENES, FLORIZEL, PERDITA,	CAMILLO, PAULINA, Lords, and Attendants</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort<lb/>
That I have had of thee!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>What, sovereign sir,<lb/>
I did not well I meant well. All my services<lb/>
You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,<lb/>
With your crown'd brother and these your contracted<lb/>
Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,<lb/>
It is a surplus of your grace, which never<lb/>
My life may last to answer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>O Paulina,<lb/>
We honour you with trouble: but we came<lb/>
To see the statue of our queen: your gallery<lb/>
Have we pass'd through, not without much content<lb/>
In many singularities; but we saw not<lb/>
That which my daughter came to look upon,<lb/>
The statue of her mother.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>As she lived peerless,<lb/>
So her dead likeness, I do well believe,<lb/>
Excels whatever yet you look'd upon<lb/>
Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it<lb/>
Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare<lb/>
To see the life as lively mock'd as ever<lb/>
Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE	standing like a statue</stage></p>


<p>
I like your silence, it the more shows off<lb/>
Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,<lb/>
Comes it not something near?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Her natural posture!<lb/>
Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed<lb/>
Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she<lb/>
In thy not chiding, for she was as tender<lb/>
As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,<lb/>
Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing<lb/>
So aged as this seems.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>O, not by much.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>So much the more our carver's excellence;<lb/>
Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her<lb/>
As she lived now.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>As now she might have done,<lb/>
So much to my good comfort, as it is<lb/>
Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,<lb/>
Even with such life of majesty, warm life,<lb/>
As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!<lb/>
I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me<lb/>
For being more stone than it? O royal piece,<lb/>
There's magic in thy majesty, which has<lb/>
My evils conjured to remembrance and<lb/>
From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,<lb/>
Standing like stone with thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p>And give me leave,<lb/>
And do not say 'tis superstition, that<lb/>
I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,<lb/>
Dear queen, that ended when I but began,<lb/>
Give me that hand of yours to kiss.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>O, patience!<lb/>
The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,<lb/>
Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,<lb/>
So many summers dry; scarce any joy<lb/>
Did ever so long live; no sorrow<lb/>
But kill'd itself much sooner.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>Dear my brother,<lb/>
Let him that was the cause of this have power<lb/>
To take off so much grief from you as he<lb/>
Will piece up in himself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>Indeed, my lord,<lb/>
If I had thought the sight of my poor image<lb/>
Would thus have wrought you,&mdash;for the stone is mine&mdash;<lb/>
I'ld not have show'd it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Do not draw the curtain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy<lb/>
May think anon it moves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Let be, let be.<lb/>
Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already&mdash;<lb/>
What was he that did make it? See, my lord,<lb/>
Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins<lb/>
Did verily bear blood?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>Masterly done:<lb/>
The very life seems warm upon her lip.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>The fixture of her eye has motion in't,<lb/>
As we are mock'd with art.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>I'll draw the curtain:<lb/>
My lord's almost so far transported that<lb/>
He'll think anon it lives.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>O sweet Paulina,<lb/>
Make me to think so twenty years together!<lb/>
No settled senses of the world can match<lb/>
The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but<lb/>
I could afflict you farther.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Do, Paulina;<lb/>
For this affliction has a taste as sweet<lb/>
As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,<lb/>
There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel<lb/>
Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,<lb/>
For I will kiss her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>Good my lord, forbear:<lb/>
The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;<lb/>
You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own<lb/>
With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>No, not these twenty years.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERDITA</speaker>
<p>So long could I<lb/>
Stand by, a looker on.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>Either forbear,<lb/>
Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you<lb/>
For more amazement. If you can behold it,<lb/>
I'll make the statue move indeed, descend<lb/>
And take you by the hand; but then you'll think&mdash;<lb/>
Which I protest against&mdash;I am assisted<lb/>
By wicked powers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>What you can make her do,<lb/>
I am content to look on: what to speak,<lb/>
I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy<lb/>
To make her speak as move.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>It is required<lb/>
You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;<lb/>
On: those that think it is unlawful business<lb/>
I am about, let them depart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>Proceed:<lb/>
No foot shall stir.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>Music, awake her; strike!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Music</stage></p>


<p>
'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;<lb/>
Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,<lb/>
I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,<lb/>
Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him<lb/>
Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>HERMIONE comes down</stage></p>


<p>
Start not; her actions shall be holy as<lb/>
You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her<lb/>
Until you see her die again; for then<lb/>
You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:<lb/>
When she was young you woo'd her; now in age<lb/>
Is she become the suitor?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>O, she's warm!<lb/>
If this be magic, let it be an art<lb/>
Lawful as eating.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>She embraces him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAMILLO</speaker>
<p>She hangs about his neck:<lb/>
If she pertain to life let her speak too.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>POLIXENES</speaker>
<p>Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,<lb/>
Or how stolen from the dead.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>That she is living,<lb/>
Were it but told you, should be hooted at<lb/>
Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,<lb/>
Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.<lb/>
Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel<lb/>
And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;<lb/>
Our Perdita is found.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERMIONE</speaker>
<p>You gods, look down<lb/>
And from your sacred vials pour your graces<lb/>
Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.<lb/>
Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found<lb/>
Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,<lb/>
Knowing by Paulina that the oracle<lb/>
Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved<lb/>
Myself to see the issue.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAULINA</speaker>
<p>There's time enough for that;<lb/>
Lest they desire upon this push to trouble<lb/>
Your joys with like relation. Go together,<lb/>
You precious winners all; your exultation<lb/>
Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,<lb/>
Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there<lb/>
My mate, that's never to be found again,<lb/>
Lament till I am lost.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONTES</speaker>
<p>O, peace, Paulina!<lb/>
Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,<lb/>
As I by thine a wife: this is a match,<lb/>
And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;<lb/>
But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,<lb/>
As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many<lb/>
A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far&mdash;<lb/>
For him, I partly know his mind&mdash;to find thee<lb/>
An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,<lb/>
And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty<lb/>
Is richly noted and here justified<lb/>
By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.<lb/>
What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,<lb/>
That e'er I put between your holy looks<lb/>
My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,<lb/>
And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,<lb/>
Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,<lb/>
Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely<lb/>
Each one demand an answer to his part<lb/>
Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first<lb/>
We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.<lb/>
