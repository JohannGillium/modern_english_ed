<head>A Lover's Complaint</head>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>FROM off a hill whose concave womb reworded</l>
<l>A plaintful story from a sistering vale,</l>
<l>My spirits to attend this double voice accorded,</l>
<l>And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale;</l>
<l>Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,</l>
<l>Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,</l>
<l>Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Upon her head a platted hive of straw,</l>
<l>Which fortified her visage from the sun,</l>
<l>Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw</l>
<l>The carcass of beauty spent and done:</l>
<l>Time had not scythed all that youth begun,</l>
<l>Nor youth all quit; but, spite of heaven's fell rage,</l>
<l>Some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,</l>
<l>Which on it had conceited characters,</l>
<l>Laundering the silken figures in the brine</l>
<l>That season'd woe had pelleted in tears,</l>
<l>And often reading what contents it bears;</l>
<l>As often shrieking undistinguish'd woe,</l>
<l>In clamours of all size, both high and low.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Sometimes her levell'd eyes their carriage ride,</l>
<l>As they did battery to the spheres intend;</l>
<l>Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied</l>
<l>To the orbed earth; sometimes they do extend</l>
<l>Their view right on; anon their gazes lend</l>
<l>To every place at once, and, nowhere fix'd,</l>
<l>The mind and sight distractedly commix'd.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,</l>
<l>Proclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride</l>
<l>For some, untuck'd, descended her sheaved hat,</l>
<l>Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;</l>
<l>Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,</l>
<l>And true to bondage would not break from thence,</l>
<l>Though slackly braided in loose negligence.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>A thousand favours from a maund she drew</l>
<l>Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,</l>
<l>Which one by one she in a river threw,</l>
<l>Upon whose weeping margent she was set;</l>
<l>Like usury, applying wet to wet,</l>
<l>Or monarch's hands that let not bounty fall</l>
<l>Where want cries some, but where excess begs all.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>Of folded schedules had she many a one,</l>
<l>Which she perused, sigh'd, tore, and gave the flood;</l>
<l>Crack'd many a ring of posied gold and bone</l>
<l>Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud;</l>
<l>Found yet moe letters sadly penn'd in blood,</l>
<l>With sleided silk feat and affectedly</l>
<l>Enswathed, and seal'd to curious secrecy.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>These often bathed she in her fluxive eyes,</l>
<l>And often kiss'd, and often 'gan to tear:</l>
<l>Cried 'O false blood, thou register of lies,</l>
<l>What unapproved witness dost thou bear!</l>
<l>Ink would have seem'd more black and damned here!'</l>
<l>This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,</l>
<l>Big discontent so breaking their contents.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh&mdash;</l>
<l>Sometime a blusterer, that the ruffle knew</l>
<l>Of court, of city, and had let go by</l>
<l>The swiftest hours, observed as they flew&mdash;</l>
<l>Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew,</l>
<l>And, privileged by age, desires to know</l>
<l>In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>So slides he down upon his grained bat,</l>
<l>And comely-distant sits he by her side;</l>
<l>When he again desires her, being sat,</l>
<l>Her grievance with his hearing to divide:</l>
<l>If that from him there may be aught applied</l>
<l>Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,</l>
<l>'Tis promised in the charity of age.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'Father,' she says, 'though in me you behold</l>
<l>The injury of many a blasting hour,</l>
<l>Let it not tell your judgment I am old;</l>
<l>Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power:</l>
<l>I might as yet have been a spreading flower,</l>
<l>Fresh to myself, If I had self-applied</l>
<l>Love to myself and to no love beside.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'But, woe is me! too early I attended</l>
<l>A youthful suit&mdash;it was to gain my grace&mdash;</l>
<l>Of one by nature's outwards so commended,</l>
<l>That maidens' eyes stuck over all his face:</l>
<l>Love lack'd a dwelling, and made him her place;</l>
<l>And when in his fair parts she did abide,</l>
<l>She was new lodged and newly deified.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'His browny locks did hang in crooked curls;</l>
<l>And every light occasion of the wind</l>
<l>Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.</l>
<l>What's sweet to do, to do will aptly find:</l>
<l>Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,</l>
<l>For on his visage was in little drawn</l>
<l>What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'Small show of man was yet upon his chin;</l>
<l>His phoenix down began but to appear</l>
<l>Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin</l>
<l>Whose bare out-bragg'd the web it seem'd to wear:</l>
<l>Yet show'd his visage by that cost more dear;</l>
<l>And nice affections wavering stood in doubt</l>
<l>If best were as it was, or best without.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'His qualities were beauteous as his form,</l>
<l>For maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;</l>
<l>Yet, if men moved him, was he such a storm</l>
<l>As oft 'twixt May and April is to see,</l>
<l>When winds breathe sweet, untidy though they be.</l>
<l>His rudeness so with his authorized youth</l>
<l>Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'Well could he ride, and often men would say</l>
<l>'That horse his mettle from his rider takes:</l>
<l>Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,</l>
<l>What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop he makes!'</l>
<l>And controversy hence a question takes,</l>
<l>Whether the horse by him became his deed,</l>
<l>Or he his manage by the well-doing steed.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'But quickly on this side the verdict went:</l>
<l>His real habitude gave life and grace</l>
<l>To appertainings and to ornament,</l>
<l>Accomplish'd in himself, not in his case:</l>
<l>All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,</l>
<l>Came for additions; yet their purposed trim</l>
<l>Pieced not his grace, but were all graced by him.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'So on the tip of his subduing tongue</l>
<l>All kinds of arguments and question deep,</l>
<l>All replication prompt, and reason strong,</l>
<l>For his advantage still did wake and sleep:</l>
<l>To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,</l>
<l>He had the dialect and different skill,</l>
<l>Catching all passions in his craft of will:</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'That he did in the general bosom reign</l>
<l>Of young, of old; and sexes both enchanted,</l>
<l>To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain</l>
<l>In personal duty, following where he haunted:</l>
<l>Consents bewitch'd, ere he desire, have granted;</l>
<l>And dialogued for him what he would say,</l>
<l>Ask'd their own wills, and made their wills obey.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'Many there were that did his picture get,</l>
<l>To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind;</l>
<l>Like fools that in th' imagination set</l>
<l>The goodly objects which abroad they find</l>
<l>Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign'd;</l>
<l>And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them</l>
<l>Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them:</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'So many have, that never touch'd his hand,</l>
<l>Sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart.</l>
<l>My woeful self, that did in freedom stand,</l>
<l>And was my own fee-simple, not in part,</l>
<l>What with his art in youth, and youth in art,</l>
<l>Threw my affections in his charmed power,</l>
<l>Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'Yet did I not, as some my equals did,</l>
<l>Demand of him, nor being desired yielded;</l>
<l>Finding myself in honour so forbid,</l>
<l>With safest distance I mine honour shielded:</l>
<l>Experience for me many bulwarks builded</l>
<l>Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain'd the foil</l>
<l>Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'But, ah, who ever shunn'd by precedent</l>
<l>The destined ill she must herself assay?</l>
<l>Or forced examples, 'gainst her own content,</l>
<l>To put the by-past perils in her way?</l>
<l>Counsel may stop awhile what will not stay;</l>
<l>For when we rage, advice is often seen</l>
<l>By blunting us to make our wits more keen.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood,</l>
<l>That we must curb it upon others' proof;</l>
<l>To be forbod the sweets that seem so good,</l>
<l>For fear of harms that preach in our behoof.</l>
<l>O appetite, from judgment stand aloof!</l>
<l>The one a palate hath that needs will taste,</l>
<l>Though Reason weep, and cry, 'It is thy last.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'For further I could say 'This man's untrue,'</l>
<l>And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;</l>
<l>Heard where his plants in others' orchards grew,</l>
<l>Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;</l>
<l>Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling;</l>
<l>Thought characters and words merely but art,</l>
<l>And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'And long upon these terms I held my city,</l>
<l>Till thus he gan besiege me: 'Gentle maid,</l>
<l>Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity,</l>
<l>And be not of my holy vows afraid:</l>
<l>That's to ye sworn to none was ever said;</l>
<l>For feasts of love I have been call'd unto,</l>
<l>Till now did ne'er invite, nor never woo.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>''All my offences that abroad you see</l>
<l>Are errors of the blood, none of the mind;</l>
<l>Love made them not: with acture they may be,</l>
<l>Where neither party is nor true nor kind:</l>
<l>They sought their shame that so their shame did find;</l>
<l>And so much less of shame in me remains,</l>
<l>By how much of me their reproach contains.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>''Among the many that mine eyes have seen,</l>
<l>Not one whose flame my heart so much as warm'd,</l>
<l>Or my affection put to the smallest teen,</l>
<l>Or any of my leisures ever charm'd:</l>
<l>Harm have I done to them, but ne'er was harm'd;</l>
<l>Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,</l>
<l>And reign'd, commanding in his monarchy.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>''Look here, what tributes wounded fancies sent me,</l>
<l>Of paled pearls and rubies red as blood;</l>
<l>Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me</l>
<l>Of grief and blushes, aptly understood</l>
<l>In bloodless white and the encrimson'd mood;</l>
<l>Effects of terror and dear modesty,</l>
<l>Encamp'd in hearts, but fighting outwardly.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>''And, lo, behold these talents of their hair,</l>
<l>With twisted metal amorously impleach'd,</l>
<l>I have received from many a several fair,</l>
<l>Their kind acceptance weepingly beseech'd,</l>
<l>With the annexions of fair gems enrich'd,</l>
<l>And deep-brain'd sonnets that did amplify</l>
<l>Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>''The diamond,&mdash;why, 'twas beautiful and hard,</l>
<l>Whereto his invised properties did tend;</l>
<l>The deep-green emerald, in whose fresh regard</l>
<l>Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend;</l>
<l>The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend</l>
<l>With objects manifold: each several stone,</l>
<l>With wit well blazon'd, smiled or made some moan.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>''Lo, all these trophies of affections hot,</l>
<l>Of pensived and subdued desires the tender,</l>
<l>Nature hath charged me that I hoard them not,</l>
<l>But yield them up where I myself must render,</l>
<l>That is, to you, my origin and ender;</l>
<l>For these, of force, must your oblations be,</l>
<l>Since I their altar, you enpatron me.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>''O, then, advance of yours that phraseless hand,</l>
<l>Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;</l>
<l>Take all these similes to your own command,</l>
<l>Hallow'd with sighs that burning lungs did raise;</l>
<l>What me your minister, for you obeys,</l>
<l>Works under you; and to your audit comes</l>
<l>Their distract parcels in combined sums.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>''Lo, this device was sent me from a nun,</l>
<l>Or sister sanctified, of holiest note;</l>
<l>Which late her noble suit in court did shun,</l>
<l>Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;</l>
<l>For she was sought by spirits of richest coat,</l>
<l>But kept cold distance, and did thence remove,</l>
<l>To spend her living in eternal love.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>''But, O my sweet, what labour is't to leave</l>
<l>The thing we have not, mastering what not strives,</l>
<l>Playing the place which did no form receive,</l>
<l>Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves?</l>
<l>She that her fame so to herself contrives,</l>
<l>The scars of battle 'scapeth by the flight,</l>
<l>And makes her absence valiant, not her might.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>''O, pardon me, in that my boast is true:</l>
<l>The accident which brought me to her eye</l>
<l>Upon the moment did her force subdue,</l>
<l>And now she would the caged cloister fly:</l>
<l>Religious love put out Religion's eye:</l>
<l>Not to be tempted, would she be immured,</l>
<l>And now, to tempt, all liberty procured.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>''How mighty then you are, O, hear me tell!</l>
<l>The broken bosoms that to me belong</l>
<l>Have emptied all their fountains in my well,</l>
<l>And mine I pour your ocean all among:</l>
<l>I strong o'er them, and you o'er me being strong,</l>
<l>Must for your victory us all congest,</l>
<l>As compound love to physic your cold breast.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>''My parts had power to charm a sacred nun,</l>
<l>Who, disciplined, ay, dieted in grace,</l>
<l>Believed her eyes when they to assail begun,</l>
<l>All vows and consecrations giving place:</l>
<l>O most potential love! vow, bond, nor space,</l>
<l>In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,</l>
<l>For thou art all, and all things else are thine.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>''When thou impressest, what are precepts worth</l>
<l>Of stale example? When thou wilt inflame,</l>
<l>How coldly those impediments stand forth</l>
<l>Of wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!</l>
<l>Love's arms are peace, 'gainst rule, 'gainst sense,</l>
<l>'gainst shame,</l>
<l>And sweetens, in the suffering pangs it bears,</l>
<l>The aloes of all forces, shocks, and fears.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>''Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,</l>
<l>Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine;</l>
<l>And supplicant their sighs to you extend,</l>
<l>To leave the battery that you make 'gainst mine,</l>
<l>Lending soft audience to my sweet design,</l>
<l>And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath</l>
<l>That shall prefer and undertake my troth.'</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'This said, his watery eyes he did dismount,</l>
<l>Whose sights till then were levell'd on my face;</l>
<l>Each cheek a river running from a fount</l>
<l>With brinish current downward flow'd apace:</l>
<l>O, how the channel to the stream gave grace!</l>
<l>Who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses</l>
<l>That flame through water which their hue encloses.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies</l>
<l>In the small orb of one particular tear!</l>
<l>But with the inundation of the eyes</l>
<l>What rocky heart to water will not wear?</l>
<l>What breast so cold that is not warmed here?</l>
<l>O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,</l>
<l>Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'For, lo, his passion, but an art of craft,</l>
<l>Even there resolved my reason into tears;</l>
<l>There my white stole of chastity I daff'd,</l>
<l>Shook off my sober guards and civil fears;</l>
<l>Appear to him, as he to me appears,</l>
<l>All melting; though our drops this difference bore,</l>
<l>His poison'd me, and mine did him restore.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'In him a plenitude of subtle matter,</l>
<l>Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,</l>
<l>Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,</l>
<l>Or swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,</l>
<l>In either's aptness, as it best deceives,</l>
<l>To blush at speeches rank to weep at woes,</l>
<l>Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'That not a heart which in his level came</l>
<l>Could 'scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,</l>
<l>Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;</l>
<l>And, veil'd in them, did win whom he would maim:</l>
<l>Against the thing he sought he would exclaim;</l>
<l>When he most burn'd in heart-wish'd luxury,</l>
<l>He preach'd pure maid, and praised cold chastity.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'Thus merely with the garment of a Grace</l>
<l>The naked and concealed fiend he cover'd;</l>
<l>That th' unexperient gave the tempter place,</l>
<l>Which like a cherubin above them hover'd.</l>
<l>Who, young and simple, would not be so lover'd?</l>
<l>Ay me! I fell; and yet do question make</l>
<l>What I should do again for such a sake.</l>
</lg>

<lg type="stanza">
<l>'O, that infected moisture of his eye,</l>
<l>O, that false fire which in his cheek so glow'd,</l>
<l>O, that forced thunder from his heart did fly,</l>
<l>O, that sad breath his spongy lungs bestow'd,</l>
<l>O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,</l>
<l>Would yet again betray the fore-betray'd,</l>
<l>And new pervert a reconciled maid!'</l>
