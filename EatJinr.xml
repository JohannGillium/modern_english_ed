<head>The Old Jinrikisha [1st installment]<lb/>
<hi rend="italic">Conkey's Home Journal</hi> 6.5
(February 1, 1900): 1-2.<lb/>
By Onoto Watanna<lb/>
Drawing by John C. Gilbert</head>

<p>Now, before I begin
to tell you about the people who have
ridden in me, I would like to say a
few
little things about myself. Of
course, I understand that you would
far rather
hear about <hi
rend="italic">people</hi> than
<hi rend="italic">me</hi>, for
that is natural, to wish first
of
all, to hear of your kind, but please
remember that I have that same
feeling. I
am far more interested in jinrikishas<ref target="n1">[1]</ref>
than I am in people, so you can
understand somewhat of my unselfishness, when
I
propose, after only a few words about
myself, to confine myself almost
entirely
to telling you about those happy or
hapless mortals in whose lives I have

played my part.
</p><p>
I always was an
inquisitive jinrikisha. I remember
when I was being made, one of the
workmen,
or, as I sometimes like to call them,
one of my creators, remarked, after
he
had padded me with the softest of
rice straw and matting, that I was as
soft
and pliable to the touch as a pretty
woman. So my sex was set. This may
account
in a measure for a foolish soft-
heartedness I am sure you will learn
to notice
in me, and also the inquisitiveness
and contrariness of my nature, liking
and
disliking people just&mdash;<hi
rend="italic">because</hi>. Mind
you, not that <hi
rend="italic">I</hi>
would lay
these failings or virtues at the door
of the weaker sex. By no means. <hi
rend="italic">I</hi>
am merely speaking from a <hi
rend="italic">human</hi>
standpoint, for I have noticed that
whenever these traits <hi
rend="italic">are</hi> shown in
any one, there is always somebody
ready to say, &ldquo;Just like a
woman!&rdquo; though for my part I do
think men are just
as weak, inquisitive, and contrary as
women any day. But how I do chatter!
I
meant to tell you a little of my own
history.
</p><p>
Well, in the first
place, I was born, or built, in the
city of Tokyo. I was, in fact, one of
the
first vehicles built by the
celebrated Akiba Daisuke, who
introduced the
vehicle into Japan, although I don't
think he was really the inventor.
That
question was never settled. Some day
that Takayama Kasuke and two others
invented it somewhere in 1869, but,
on the other hand, an American
missionary
also claimed the honor. However this
may be, Akiba Daisuke was the first
to
start a regular business and
manufactory of the same.
</p><p>
Until quite recently
I was looked upon with great contempt
and disdain by those who chanced to
come
in contact with me, on account of my
old-fashioned and antiquated
appearance,
they much referring the new-fangled,
giddy, springy things that have tried

their best to push my nose out of
joint. So I was thrown in a deserted,
unused
store-room, where I could get hardly a
breath of the sweet, fresh air, and
only
a stray gleam of sunlight. There,
right in front of this store-room
stood a
public jinrikisha stand, where any
number of the new-fashioned common
<hi rend="italic">wood</hi>
and <hi rend="italic">bamboo</hi>
things were resting brazenly in the
sun! I was very, very
lonesome, though once in a while some
apple-faced, rosy children ran
through
the lumber room, and climbed into my
heart and played with me for hours.
Children always did love me. They
used to beg the man who owned me to
&ldquo;<hi
rend="italic">Please</hi>
draw this funny old rickshaw outside
for them,&rdquo; and I believe it was
in answer
to their little prayers and
entreaties that the great Sun-Goddess
one day shook
the ground with terrific force all
about us, and knocked the old lumber
house
into ruins. I never could tell how it
happened, but after the earthquake
had
passed, and when the runners were
busy clearing out the goods from
under the
pile of debris, they found me in a
safe little nook and hollow that some
stray
boards had built about me, with
scarcely a scratch to my back. They
pulled me
out, and for a time I was set
standing a little apart from the
ruins, my master
being undecided as to what he would
do with me. Now, it happened that
soon
after this one of the great lords in
the train of our beloved emperor
chanced
to be passing through this portion of
the city.
</p><p>
He rode past me at
first, with merely a wondering glance
of interest at my ancient appearance.
I
noticed, however, that he rode very
slowly, and just as he reached the
bend in
the road, he turned his horse's head,
and back he came trotting down the
street. For some time he stood
looking at me critically from where
he sat on
his beautiful white horse. Then he
dismounted, and began examining me
through a
pair of glasses, curiously at first,
and then enthusiastically. He began
feeling me all over, although I was
very dusty. He even took his
handkerchief
out and rubbed some of the dirt off
my back. I think he was looking for a

crest. He must have found it, and,
perhaps, several other interesting
things
about me, for he went through all the
antics of a connoisseur before a rare

piece of an old and almost forgotten
art. Anyhow, I think he was so
thoroughly
delighted with me that he gave my
master three hundred yen, and ordered
me
carried with great care to his
castle.
</p><p>
I can tell you I was
glad, though. My master had neglected
and treated me shamefully. I had
become sour
and cynical, and even felt I was
falling to decay. Of course, I was
well aware
that by ill-usage, and through being
out in all kinds of weather, I had
become
so matted with dirt and crusted with
old age, wrinkles, and cracks, that
it
would have been impossible for any
one to tell of what material I was
made, to
say nothing of a severe stroke of
lightning that had blistered one of
my sides.
Still, I hold that any one who knew
the genuine from the sham and could
tell
gold from brass, ought to have
recognized my caste in spite of all
odds against
me. And yet for many years I was used
merely as a common old and cheap
vehicle
in a public jinrikisha stand.
</p><p>
However, I was taken
by my new master to his castle,
cleaned and polished with the
greatest care,
and pampered and petted till I
scarcely knew myself. I soon became
happy again
and at peace with all the world. I
suppose I ought to stop right here,
but I do
want to tell you something else about
myself, though I feel a trifle shy in

this regard.
</p><p>
It sounds so vain
(and womanish, you would say), for me
to say I am handsome, in spite of age
and
sorrows. But it is true, and,
furthermore, I will add to this, that
once I was
beautiful; a sweet, dainty little
princess who rode in me, pronounced
me
exquisite. My body is lacquered
black, yellow, crimson, and green,
and adorned
with beautifully colored
representations of famous sceneries,
warriors, actors,
women, birds, fish, beasts, and
arabesques. In a corner of my back is
my
original owner's name and address. He
was one of the most powerful samurai
in his day, but of him, his family
and
their
fate, I will tell you later. In the
very center of my back you will find
his
crest, painted in gold, and that
alone ought to be sufficient for you
to know
whether or not I was of importance in
my day. I am padded with the finest
rice
straw and matting and silk, and the
satin that covers the padding is so
heavily
embroidered that you can scarcely
find a spot of the original plain
surface of
silk. I admit sadly that all the
polishing and remodeling in my
lacquered body,
all the darning and mending to my
cushions and inner padding that my
new and
kind master has given me, can never
restore the original splendor to my
appearance, never mend the heart-
breaking cracks in the lacquer; yet
the new
lining and the calash-top,
which are of the finest material,
are, in a measure, a consolation, and

certainly not to be despised.
Besides, as my new master would say,
<hi rend="italic">I</hi>
have a history, <hi
rend="italic">I</hi> have seen
life, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am
old, and in Japan,
&ldquo;blessed are the old.&rdquo;
So, though for many years I have been
cast aside,
neglected and mistreated as a good-
for-nought by the common and
ignorant, I am
once more restored to my original
luxury in surroundings and
associates, which
in every way comport with my
aristocratic birth and relations of
the past. I
have met with severe reverses in my
day, and had to be used in menial
capacities even, but I still hold
that my birth, and the fact of the
greatness
of my first master, entitle me to set
myself down as being among the few
really
fine and rare things of the world.
</p><p>
And, like most old
people, I at times become
reminiscent. I love to dwell on
memories of the past.
It will be satisfaction to me to
prattle of some of the little
comedies and
tragedies that I have been a silent,
though sympathetic and appreciative
witness of. And so I crave your
honorable august attention.

<div1 type="chapter" id="d4">
<head>I. The Lady Natsu</head>

<p>I was made specially
to order for the great Marquis Shomu
Jokichi, who was my original master
and
owner. His family had for many
centuries been one of the most
powerful under
the Tokugawa dynasty<ref target="n2">[2]</ref>,
and he himself had at one time been
lord of all Kummomotta. They belonged
to that proud and heroic
class of Japanese called the samurai,
and were one of the families who
suffered
death and disaster at the time of the
restoration of the government system,

when all classes of people became
recognized equally. To-day the samurai
class
is practically extinct in Japan.
Withal their vaunted heroism and
apparent cool
scorn for death; in spite of the fact
that the samurai were ever ready to
espouse the cause of the weak and
protect those who appealed to them,
they
were, nevertheless, as a class,
essentially tyrannous and oppressive,
taking
advantage of their rank to commit the
most outrageous and lawless acts. I
fancy
that the power vested in the samurai
was too unlimited, and they lost
sight of
the fine principles of their calling
in their pride. They were proud of
being
the Shogun's bodyguard, and under his
special protection. Though inferior
in
rank and income, they refused to bow
to the <hi
rend="italic">daimyo,</hi><ref target="n3">[3]</ref> whom
they despised as boors and
cowards, kept in power solely by
their hereditary possessions, and
they lost no
opportunity of showing their
contempt. The result was, ever eager
for brawls,
they often forced quarrels in the
street, and exercised to the full the

samurai's privilege of killing at
will any harmless citizen in their
bad books.
They naturally in time became very
much detested and had countless
enemies; on
one hand the <hi
rend="italic">daimyo,</hi> on the
other the common people, who had
enough
spirit to resist them.
</p>
<pb n="2"/>
<p>
And yet, the finest,
most noble, in fact, the very flower
of the country, were found chiefly
among
this class. Men of the highest
principle and honor, who could not
have been
otherwise than just and upright, and
who were in every way an honor to
their
calling, these were forced to suffer
and bear much opprobrium because of
the
acts of those who, either from
impetuosity or wickedness, made
themselves and,
therefore, their class, obnoxious to
all.
</p><p>
Notable for his
goodness, kindness, and justice in
those hot and feudal days was my
master.
Ever ready to keep the peace, and
serve the Shogun loyally and well,
he, after
many years of devoted and unselfish
service, retired to his castle which
was
situated on the shore of the Hayama
within sight of Fuji-yama, the
peerless mountain, and only a few
hours ride
from Tokyo.
</p><p>
And it was to his home that I was
taken, and where I spent the first
few years of my life.
</p><p>
The Marquis Shomu's
family consisted of himself, his
wife, and his daughter,<ref target="n4">[4]</ref> the Lady
Natsu, whose
name means summer. And she was fair
as the fairest blush of a summer day!

</p><p>
She was a child when
I first came to the family, and we
fell in love with each other at
sight. Every
day her maid would lead her by the
hand from the house, and every
retainer or
servant within sight would bow almost
to the ground as she passed, as a
mark of
respect, and in token that they would
serve and protect her forever. Then
she
would be lifted into my heart (I
always like to speak of that part of
me as my
heart), the maid would clamber in
beside her, and away we'd go, and all
along
the road Lady Natsu would lisp and
prattle and chatter and laugh, till
it
seemed as of the whole world were
made of sunshine and smiles. Ah!
those were
happy days!
</p><p>
She was a child of
nature, and nature loved and gave her
likeness to her child. Sometimes the

runners would run for miles without
pausing once. They were the swiftest-
footed
runners I have ever seen in my day.
The runners of to-day&mdash;bah! what
with their
lying and stealing and wheedling! But
Ido and Omi, never were there two
such
jolly, light-hearted, good-natured
creatures! And so it was with all the

servants and retainers of my lord's
household. It seemed as if he could
only
draw about him the good.
</p><p>
Sometimes we would
pause by shady spots along the
Hayama, some of them luxuriantly
beautiful,
lovely as a fairyland dream. The
slow, scintillating waters of the
Hayama, the
dazzling blaze of the fields, the
endless blue of the skies, nature
thrilled
with her beauty, and Natsu!&mdash;she
laughed and laughed and laughed. She
was
happy&mdash;we were all happy!
</p><p>
Thus, for ten happy
years I was the constant companion of
the Lady Natsu. She scarcely went out
of
the house but it was to be taken somewhere
by me, for she was the daughter of a
noble,
and it would have been unseemly for
her to have walked. On the sleeves of
all
her beautiful gowns there was a gold
crest, and the crest was exactly like
that
painted on my back in gold. The maid
would carry their lunches in dainty
lacquer boxes that bore the same
gold crest.
</p><p>
Sometimes the Lady
Natsu would wish to alight while she
ate her lunch, and though the maid
would
not have dared to permit her to do
so, had they been within sight of the

castle, yet she became quite lax
while in the woods, and would even
permit her
little mistress to perch on one of my
shafts held by the runners, whilst
she
chatted with them and shared her
little luncheon just as if she were
not the
daughter of a great lord, but simply
a shining, beautiful little sunbeam!

</p><p>
And the tales she
would tell them, the songs she would
sing! Sometimes the maid would
smuggle a <hi
rend="italic">samisen</hi><ref target="n5">[5]</ref>
under one of
my cushions, and then they would hold
the widest, gayest concerts right in
the
open air. Ido and Omi would go
through the most extravagant
contortions and
antics, to please their little
mistress, the maid would play the <hi
rend="italic">samisen,</hi>
and the Lady Natsu would sing and
dance. Then, when they would start
for home,
her head would fall sleepily back
against the maid, Oyoshi, and she
would
murmur, &ldquo;Please, Oyoshi-san, do
not tell my <hi
rend="italic">father,</hi>&rdquo;
for she feared he
would consider this conduct
unbecoming, as she was being brought
up with all
the care and strictness bestowed on
the daughters of nobles.
</p><p>
When the Lady Natsu
was about fifteen years of age, a
terrible disaster overtook her
father's
household.
</p><p>
With the fall of the
dynasty, the samurai lost their rank
and power, though as with the last
gasp
of the dying, they fought for their
lords and their rights. A great part
of
them were killed in frays; many
families met together and solemnly
took their
lives, rather than suffer the
disgrace of subjection by those they
had ever
deemed their inferiors. Among these
were my master and mistress. Their
estates
had been confiscated, their retainers
scattered. I will never forget that
night, when the souls of my beloved
master and his gentle wife passed
from
their earthly bodies and started on
the long, long road to the Meido<ref target="n6">[6]</ref>
together. Deserted
by friends, hunted by foes, their
lands laid to waste, and their wealth
stolen,
they decided that death surely was
more honorable and bearable than
life.
Faithful to the end, Oyoshi, the
maid, remained with them, weeping and
sharing
with them their sorrows. But when
they told her of their honorable
decision to
die, and bade her bring to them their
child, the Lady Natsu, so she, too,
might
accompany them, Oyoshi wept more
bitterly than ever.
</p><p>
She knelt at her
young mistress's feet as she told her
of the command of her parents, and
begged
that she be permitted to give her own
life in place of her young
mistress's.
</p><p>
The Lady Natsu's face
blanched whiter than the snows that
reflect the sunshine and shadows of
Fuji-yama, but her voice was quite
steady as she made calm answer:
</p><p>
&ldquo;Tell my parents that
I will go with them. I am willing to
obey their august will in all
things,&rdquo; and
with these filial words, she began to
robe herself in the purest and finest
of
silks, for she was the daughter of a
samurai, and in her veins flowed the
rich
blood of bravery and heroism.
</p><p>
When she had finished
dressing herself, she went all
through the house, bidding farewell
to all the
loved objects of her sweet life; she
kissed the sacred stones and wept
before
an image of Kwannon,
the great goddess of mercy. Then she
passed out of the castle, for she
wished
also to say farewell to the things of
nature that had known and loved her.

</p><p>
It was a beautiful
spring day. The sun was shining in a
gentle, mild, caressing way.
Everywhere
the exquisite delight of the whitest,
pinkest of cherry and plum blossoms
against a sky of vivid blue! Natsu
sobbed as she gazed at it all. Ah!
she was
so vital, so full of life! She <hi
rend="italic">could</hi> not
contemplate death with the
calmness and indifference of her
august ancestors.
</p><p>
And, lastly, she came
to me, to say farewell to the old
jinrikisha that she had known from
childhood.
She leaned her head against me in
silence. I do not know whether she
was
thinking of me or not. Perhaps from
where I stood at the top of a hill
she had
a fair vantage point from which to
see the beauty of the place she was
about to
leave. But I like better to think it
was sorrow at parting with me that
made
her climb suddenly into my heart,
close her eyes and nestle far back.
</p><p>
I do not know what
possessed me. My heart was full. I
felt I must do something to save her
life. A
sudden wild wind moved me a trifle;
my back was turned toward the hill,
my
shafts from it. Suddenly I began to
roll&mdash;down, down, down&mdash;on
and on&mdash;down the
long interminable hill. What forced
me along, I cannot say, and worst of
all, I
felt I was losing all command of
myself.
</p><p>
The Lady Natsu sat up
and held on to my sides with wide
eyes of terror and shrieked aloud.
When I
came to a standstill, I was quite a
distance from the base of the hill,
and one
of my shafts was broken right off. I
stopped with a great jerk, and the
Lady
Natsu, who had fainted from fright,
fell to the ground.
</p><p>
She lay there all
that night. The next morning a party
of citizens on their road to Tokyo
came
across us, and brought the girl back
to consciousness. They felt very
sorry for
her, and treated her as gently as
they knew how. They told her her
parents were
now dead, and one of them advised her
to go along with them. The girl was
weak
and trembling, but the sweet, brave
spirit in her still was there. She
saw
there was other women with them, and
that they looked good and kind; she
understood that her parents were
dead, that the samurai's power had
fallen,
that she had nought to depend on but
herself, and she <hi
rend="italic">still loved
life</hi>.
She went with them.
</p><p>
I was a good deal
smashed and battered by my tumble and
roll down the hill. On reaching
Tokyo, I
was sold to a <hi
rend="italic">daimyo</hi> for a
small sum in gold; this man afterward
traded
me to a merchant for debt, who in
turn sold me as a second-hand vehicle
to a
public jinrikisha stand, where I
served for many, many years.
</p><p>
Only once again I saw
my mistress, the Lady Natsu. I had
been hired with several other
jinrikishas to
carry a large party of pleasure
seekers to a picturesque tea-garden
on the
highway between Yedo and Kyoto. As I
passed in at the gate, a number of
giggling, gay geisha girls ran
laughingly down to welcome the party.
I thought
I heard a familiar voice. It was
singing the beautiful, though sad,
song,
&ldquo;Sayonara&rdquo; (Good-night).
As the last weird, piercing notes
died away, she rose
to her feet and joined the other
girls at the gate. Then I saw her
quite
plainly. She was the Lady
Natsu!&mdash;the same, but not the
same. She was
beautiful, aye! more beautiful than
ever, but on her face there was the
stamp
of repressed pain and tragedy, and as
she saw me&mdash;and I think she
recognized
me&mdash;her eyes were drowned in a
mist of tears.
</p><p>
Her gowns were still
of the finest silk, still very rich,
and, yes, still bore the proud crest
of
her ancestors.
</p><p>
I want to say that
many of the daughters of the samurai
after the Restoration took up the
calling of the geisha
girl, and, in fact, may have been the
first original ones. It was necessary
for
them to be beautiful, clever,
accomplished. This they were, and
more; for they
were modest, gentle, virtuous, and
refined. The geisha girl of today is
common
and coarse in comparison. Many great
lords, <hi
rend="italic">daimyos</hi> and
nobles chose for
their brides girls working in this
capacity, so that some of them at
least were
restored to a life that resembled the
luxury and ease to which they had
been
brought up and become accustomed.

Whether the Lady
Natsu met this happy fate, I do not
know, but I have never ceased to pray
the
great Goddess of Mercy to dry her
tears.</p>

II. The American Girl</head>
<p>
Tokyo was alive and gay with throngs
of foreign visitors, for it was the
month of April, the
happiest time for visiting the Land
of Flowers. The jinrikishas were in
constant demand, and the faces of
the proprietors of the stands were
wreathed
with smiles of satisfaction, for
business was indeed prosperous. Not
only were
the vehicles in demand by the rich
Japanese, who drove almost daily to
the
temples to celebrate the birthday of
the great Buddha, but the extravagant

American tourist was in evidence
everywhere.
</p><p>
I always did like the
Americans. Not because they paid, as
a rule, more than any one else for
what
they got, as that would have profited
me little, but because of the genuine

kindness and good fellowship about
them. In fact, there was absent from
them
that too apparent patronage toward
the Japanese which most foreigners
seem to
cultivate.
</p><p>
I am going to tell
you about a young American girl, who
hired me from my master, and went
fearlessly
for a long ride. Now you will want to
understand why I use the word
"fearlessly." You see, it is not
customary for a young girl to go out
entirely
alone in Japan, and certainly not a
great distance. Yet this girl, who
could
not have been a day over twenty
years, came briskly out of her hotel,
and with
a few quick words to the runner, bade
him take her to Okubo, the western
suburb
of the capital.
</p><p>
Now, though it is
quite painful for me to speak at all
ill <ref target="n7">[7]</ref>
of those whose business it is to take
charge of me and my kind, that is,
the
runners, yet to tell my story about
this American girl, I am obliged to
do so.
Well, the runner is, alas! too often
notoriously unprincipled. He has no
compunction whatever in overcharging
the scale of fares fixed by the
police.
Although it is customary to make the
terms and pay in advance at the
stand,
nevertheless, the jinrikiman seldom
fails to extract from the customer
extra
fees for himself, and sometimes the
entire trip is spent with his begging
and
bargaining and quarreling and
higgling with his customer even while
he runs,
especially if he fancies he has an
easy customer, one whom he dares take

advantage of&mdash;such as a
foreigner who is anxious and in a
hurry to reach a
certain point and who will shut him
up by paying him.
</p><p>
The American girl
wore a pretty blue shirt waist and
sailor hat with a white fleecy veil
twisted
carelessly about it and knotted at
the back. She had keen blue eyes,
pretty red
lips, and sun-kissed golden brown
hair. There was something deliciously
frank
and engaging and wholesome about her.
She was tall and well formed, and
carried
her little head and body with all the
grace of a thoroughbred.
</p><p>
Shiku, the runner,
looked at her sideways out of his
little sharp eyes, and a wicked
calculating
look that made my heart sicken stole
over his face, as he took my shafts
in his
hands and started down the road. I
forgot to say that Tomi, the artful
proprietor of the stand, had already
charged her double fare.
</p><p>
She seemed very
happy, and although she was entirely
alone, she hummed at times softly to

herself, and seemed to be thoroughly
enjoying the drive. She was a
restless,
nervous girl, and unlike most riders
in the jinrikisha, who usually lounge

lazily back, she was all alert and
alive, letting no part of the
exquisite
landscape escape her. With her little
black camera she took no less than a

score of snap shots, and she had a
little note-book with her, which she
kept
scribbling in constantly.
</p><p>
We made our first
stop at a pretty tea garden, which
was set in the very heart of a blue
valley,
shaded by the shadows of the
mountains and the refreshing delight
of the pine
tree.
</p><p>
Here the girl
alighted, and bade the runner await
her. "I'll be back in a minute," she
told
him pleasantly.
</p><p>
The man begged for
drink money. She drew her pretty
brows together a moment, but gave him
a
handful of <hi
rend="italic">sen.</hi> Then she
entered the garden.
</p><p>
Very few girls visit
tea gardens alone, and had my runner
not been the unscrupulous fellow he
was,
he would have warned the girl.
However, I doubt if it would have
made much
difference to the girl, who was self-
reliant and fearless. She found a
seat for
herself where she could have a good
view of the various dancers and a
little
waitress in attendance on her. She
chatted constantly with the dancing
girls,
and threw her money extravagantly
among them. Of course, they
immediately
recognized her as an American girl,
and, of course, they cheated her.
</p><p>
"Yes, she would like
to see everything," she told the
servile proprietor, and they showed
her
everything.
</p><p>
She wandered
curiously through the gardens,
encountering scores of the pleasure-
loving
Japanese and a few&mdash;a very
few&mdash;foreigners. Once she paused
by the dancers, and
grew so fascinated and enthusiastic
with their odd movements, that she
clapped
her own little hands in unison with
the dancers. And as she stood
watching with
all the eager interest of a stranger
to Japan and her enticement, one of
those
tall, Vandyke-bearded men, who look
every inch the English tourist, came
quite
close to her and looked with slow,
studying eyes at the girl's sweet
face. It
is only natural that one of her
sensitive, nervous nature immediately
knows
when she is regarded. The girl faced
round to him, and their eyes met and
held
each other for a long moment. Then
the American girl blushed rosy red,
to the
tips of her little ears even, and the
man's cool, appreciative eyes grew
tender
with awakening admiration.
Involuntarily, he raised his hat and
spoke.
</p><p>
"Pardon me, are you
alone?"
</p><p>
The girl had
recovered herself. She hesitated a
moment before answering, and then
swept
aside the momentary shyness in
replying.
</p><p>
"I am," she said
simply, with a touch of sweet dignity
to her voice.
</p><p>
The Englishman
blundered&mdash;in his desire to
shield her.
</p><p>
"May I not accompany
you?"
</p><p>
The words jarred
against the girl.
</p><p>
"No, sir!" she
flashed.
</p><p>
It was the man's turn
to flush now, and he did so beneath
his bronzed skin. He understood that
the
girl had resented his manner of
addressing her.
</p><p>
"Because you were my
countrywoman I fancied&mdash;" he
began lamely.
</p><p>
"Ah! I am not that,"
said the girl. "I am an American
girl. <hi rend="italic">You</hi>
are <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
American,"
she
smiled bewitchingly, through the
half-defiant, half-coquettish eyes.
</p><p>
"You bewilder me," he
said simply.
</p><p>
The girl's little
chin was raised scornfully. She
turned her back on him, and fixed her
attention
once more on the dancers, but the
beautiful red was still fluctuating
in her
cheeks. The man was responsible for
that; hence she was not so
indifferent as
she feigned. The Englishman stood
behind her for a while, and there was
a queer
look of dawning feeling on his face,
as though he was marveling and
questioning
some emotion that must have suddenly
awakened in him.
</p><p>
I never did believe
in love at first sight. Yet here I
was a witness to a sure-enough case.
Yes,
the Englishman had fallen in love
with the American girl, and already
he was
suffering some of love's pain, for
had she not snubbed him unmercifully?

</p><p>
He walked slowly away
from her, down to the gate, his hands
thrust deep into his pockets. He took
his
stand by the numerous waiting
vehicles, apparently determined to
wait for the
girl. As soon as he was out of sight,
the girl took out her little
scribbling
pad. There were tiny, bewitching
dimples playing about her mouth and
chin.
Later on, I saw partly what she had
written. It was something like this:

</p><p>
"It certainly <hi
rend="italic">was</hi>
unpardonable for him to have
addressed me. I wonder who he is? He
had
such&mdash;eyes! but, ugh! An
Englishman! It behooves a patriotic
American girl to
detest them. Dad says we are the same
nation. I like them for some things.
I
really do. No! I don't
either&mdash;they are horrid! Murder!
what a paradox I am.
They patronize us&mdash;we always
tell ourselves&mdash;but&mdash;" the
pencil must have flown
vehemently over the page here, for it
was written very disjointedly, though

most emphatically underlined.
</p><p>
"How we <hi
rend="italic">did</hi>
thrash them, though!"
</p><p>
Then this American
maid, who believed in keeping up an
old and long-dead feud, whose blood
had
often boiled at silly, untrue
articles written by some of her
countrypeople to
the effect that the English despised
the American nation and considered
them
beneath them marched down to the gate
with the light of war still lingering
in
her eyes. She added another sentence
to her notes when she was once in the

jinrikisha, and the Englishman at the
gate had watched her. "Just like an
Englishman&mdash;to&mdash;to take it
for granted that because a girl is
<hi rend="italic">alone</hi> or
doing anything out of the ordinary
that he could in&mdash;no, not insult

exactly&mdash;but dare to <hi
rend="italic">speak</hi> to her,
indeed! And&mdash;I wonder <hi
rend="italic">why he stopped
speaking?</hi>"
</p><p>
The runner sped on
and on, past little rippling brooks,
over long valleys and rice fields,
under
the shadows of the graceful pine-
trees, and at last through a
luxuriant and
dense forest, miles away from all
points and towns. There he paused in
the
heart of the woods and set the shafts
down with a bang.
</p><p>
The American girl had
been lying back with her eyes
closed&mdash;thinking&mdash;who
knows? of the Englishman.
As the runner stopped so abruptly,
she sat up in surprise.
</p><p>
"Wha&mdash;what's the
matter?" she asked.
</p><p>
The shifty eyes of
the runner looked warily about him,
and then&mdash;
</p><p>
"Fifty <hi
rend="italic">yen,</hi>"
he said.
</p><p>
"Fifty <hi
rend="italic">yen!</hi>"
gasped the girl. "What do you mean?
How dare&mdash;What&mdash;?"
</p><p>
"Thad you are mos'
vaery reech," the man said doggedly;
"thad I nod tek you aeny furder
without
thad you give me fifty <hi
rend="italic">yen,</hi> no! one
hundred <hi
rend="italic">yen!</hi>" He
grinned

through his hideous teeth.
</p><p>
The American girl sat
stock still, staring at the man with
fixed eyes of horror and
stupefaction.
Then she recovered herself, and her
fear gave place to indignation.
</p><p>
"You cowardly thief!"
she said slowly; "you take those
shafts up this instant and continue.
I&mdash;I have
paid you all you shall get."
</p><p>
The man remained
immovable. Then he said in fairly
good English: "Yaes&mdash;I tek thad
shafts up,
bud first I will put you out. Then I
proceed on my way&mdash;and&mdash;"
he waved his
hands significantly around the
forest, and then pointed at the
skies.
</p><p>
The girl understood,
and grew very white. It would be
impossible for her to walk. What
could she do?
And to make matters worse, she did
not even have the money wherewith to
pay him
had she so desired. She had exhausted
her little fund in the tea garden.
And
then the forest! It was about four in
the afternoon already. Soon the
shadows
would deepen, and&mdash;she&mdash;<hi
rend="italic">would be
alone!</hi> She dared not contemplate
it.
The man would keep his word and
desert her, she knew that from his
set, evil
face. She knew it would be useless to
appeal to him. She gathered all her
courage and strength together.
</p><p>
"I will not get out
of the&mdash;the jinrikisha," she
said, "and if you <hi
rend="italic">dare</hi> to lay a
finger on
me&mdash;I&mdash;I'll <hi
rend="italic">kill</hi> you."
</p><p>
The man grinned.
"Whad you kill me with?" he asked
curiously, anxious
</p><p>
<pb n="6"/>
to know whether she carried any
weapon with her. A Japanese
woman might have carried a small
sword or dagger. The girl fell into
the trap
and betrayed herself, and he knew she
was defenseless.
</p><p>
"With my hands," she
said, with intrepid bravery. "You
miserable, skinny, little rat, you.
An
American girl
could&mdash;could&mdash;is stronger
than <hi rend="italic">you,</hi>"
but she was measuring
his little form with despairing eyes,
even while she attempted to frighten
him.
</p><p>
For answer the runner
took hold of my shafts and quietly
turned me sideways, holding me in his

perilous position for fully two
minutes, while the girl clung
desperately to
the sides.
</p><p>
"You pay thad
moaneys? he grinned, enjoying her
evident fear of falling.
</p><p>
"I will <hi
rend="italic">not.</hi>"
She was not tamed yet by any means.

</p><p>
"Then I will&mdash;whad
you call thad&mdash;<hi
rend="italic">dump</hi> you."
</p><p>
"Wait!"
</p><p>
The man thought she
would now pay. He put me back in
position, and the girl quickly
alighted and
advanced toward him.
</p><p>
"Do you know that
my&mdash;my friends and relatives
will miss me soon, and come to look
for me&mdash;you
will be punished&mdash;and&mdash;"
</p><p>
"Thad so? Well, I
thing I go nudder city with thad
moaneys you goin' ter pay me."
</p><p>
"Oh!"
</p><p>
He assured an
attitude of impatience and took my
shafts up. "An' thad you nod goin'
ter pay
me, I kin go nudder city where the
perlice noto onderstan. I waid long
time
now, and wish you goon-nide."
</p><p>
"Oh! no! no! no! no!"
the girl clung to my shafts
pitifully, and tried to hold him.
</p><p>
"You shall not
go&mdash;leave me alone&mdash;yet,"
she said breathlessly.
</p><p>
And now they were
both fighting for my shafts. Her
little delicate hands clung madly,
feverishly
to them, and tried to wrestle with
him for them. She must have felt that
so
long as she could hold me he would
not leave her alone. The man belonged
to the
very lowest type of the ruffian. The
girl was almost his match in
strength.
Finding that he could not wrest the
shafts from the girl, and being
somewhat
fearful of her strength, he sought a
fiendish method of taking her by
surprise
with pain and then dashing for his
liberty. He bit one of her little
tightly
clasped hands. And then the American
girl screamed&mdash;screamed aloud:
</p><p>
"Help! help! oh,
help! Fire! Murder! Thief! Help!"
</p><p>
Darkness was already
at hand. Only a few rays of the dying
sunset crept through the forest and
spread a melancholy stray gleam of
light. But a voice, a full manly
voice
answered that frantic cry, and the
voice was close at hand!
</p><p>
A minute after strong
hands were laid on the runner, and
the distracted girl was clinging,
pitifully,
unconscious of what she was doing, to
a big stranger, and she was sobbing
like
a child against his shoulder.
</p><p>
It was the
Englishman, and he let the girl cry
on her, heart out, in his
arms&mdash;nay! I
believe he encouraged her to do so.
</p><p>
Then when she had
quieted down, he led her gently to
his own kurumma, and walked up to the
new shivering
runner, who was being held by two of
his kurummayas. No explanation from
the
girl was needed. He already
understood. Perhaps had anticipated
it somewhat,
for he had deliberately followed the
road her runner had taken. With his
hand
on the collar of the wretched,
shivering, cringing runner, he
marched him over
to the girl.
</p><p>
"I shall give him the
damnedest<ref target="n8">[8]</ref>
thrashing he ever had in his life,"
he said. "Then when we get to Tokyo,
I'll
hand him over to the police."
</p><p>
The girl recognized
his voice, and in the semi-darkness
saw his tall, goodly form beside the

vehicle.
</p><p>
"You&mdash;you&mdash;
Englishmen&mdash;are&mdash;are
so <hi
rend="italic">good</hi>&mdash;and&mdash;and <hi
rend="italic">brave,</hi>" she
said between her
sobs. Then she
added timidly: "I&mdash;I&mdash;don't
you recognize me?"
</p><p>
She had forgotten what he had said
about the runner.
</p><p>
"Yes&mdash;I spoke to
you&mdash;tried to warn you in the
tea garden. I am afraid I offended
you. I beg
your pardon. The runner&mdash;" She
felt instinctively that he was
smiling in
despite of the situation, and she
laughed a trifle hysterically
herself.
</p><p>
"Let him go," she shivered; "it would
do no good."
</p><p>
"Yes," there was a
queer note in his voice now,
"I&mdash;er&mdash;believe I will.
He&mdash;ah&mdash;may have done <hi
rend="italic">me</hi>
a service, you know."
</p><p>
"And <hi rend="italic">me,</hi>"
she
breathed very gently.
</p><p>
The Englishman
released his hold on the runner's
collar, and in the darkness found the
girl's
little grateful hand extended.

III.</head>
<p>The Englishman and the American
girl were in the habit of making
almost daily trips
into the forest where the girl had
had such a horrible experience with
my
runner. They did not seem to bear the
smallest malice toward the man,
however,
and even made a point of choosing me
as the vehicle to ride in, though
they had
two new runners now. Shiku had
disappeared; no one knew where or
what had
become of him.
</p><p>
The
Englishman was the Honorable Frank
Arthur Montrose, and he was the heir
to a
noble English house and title. He had
stopped at Japan on a trip round the

world, and liking the country full
well, had decided to pitch his tent
for an
indefinite period there. He had been
on the island over six months when he
met
the American girl. They say
Englishmen are slow and laborious in
their
courtships. I do not know as to that.
I only know that hardly a month after

their encounter in the woods, the
American girl was wearing an
engagement ring,
and I think the Englishman usually
addressed her as "sweetheart,"
"darling," "dearie,"
or something like that, when they
were alone together.
</p><p>
However,
I intended in this chapter to tell
you not of Montrose and the American
girl,
whose name, by the way, was Beryl
Evans, but of Montrose's little
sister,
Elinore. Somehow when I have anything
to say connected with Montrose and
Beryl
Evans, I always forget my subject in
my prattle about <hi
rend="italic">them.</hi> You see
they
managed somehow to creep into the
softest part of my heart. They hired
me every
day for a whole month&mdash;their
courtship month, and I tell you what,
Tomi, my
proprietor, was delighted though,
because most people preferred one of
the
newer and more fashionable vehicles
to me, and he had a hard job to let
me at
all. So you see I had a good
opportunity to get well acquainted
with the couple,
and it is not at all extraordinary
that a fondness for each other sprang
up
between us, for I always had a
weakness for lovers, and most people
who rode in
me more than once or twice usually
got attached to me for some reason or

another. I fancy there was something
more comfortable and sympathetic
about me
than the other vehicles.
</p><p>
But
pardon an old vehicle's garrulity for
straying from my subject.
</p><p>
Elinore
Montrose had come to Japan, not
merely to join her brother, but to
meet there
and marry the man to whom she had
been betrothed for three years, and
who was
with her brother in Japan. The girl
had conceived the notion that a
marriage in
Japan would be quite ideal, and had
coaxed her brother into permitting
her to
join him, for he has always been her
adviser and confidant in all things.

</p><p>
She
was a fair, quite, sweet looking
girl, with pale golden hair, dreamy
blue eyes,
and a skin as white and pink as a
baby's. She was shy and retiring in
disposition, one of those dependent,
loving little women with big pathetic

faithful eyes, frail and ethereal as
a lily, but staunch, and intensely
true to
those she loved.
</p><p>
Ernest
Crowder, the young man to whom she
was betrothed, was in Yokohama at the
time
she arrived, and they expected him
back any day. They had hidden from
him the
fact of the girl's contemplated visit
to Japan, wishing to surprise him;
and
now the days were spent in eager
anticipation of his return to Tokyo
and his
surprised delight at finding the girl
there.
</p><p>
Very
joyously and happily did the two
girls chatter and confide in each
other. Both
of their love stories were so
different. The English girl had known
her lover
ever since they were little boy and
girl sweethearts together&mdash;the
American
girl had known hers but one short
month! They were planning to be
married
together on the same day.
</p><p>
Now it happened that Ernest Crowder
returned unexpectedly to Tokyo one
evening, and being tired out from his
journey went to his hotel without
sending word to any of his friends.
Next morning he arose quite early,
hired a
jinrikisha and sped off into the
country. I did not know where at the
time, but guessed that he was not
merely
going for a desultory ride, but was
bound for some particular place, and,
in fact, Crowder, before he left
Tokyo,
was in the habit of going off by
himself for those rides, and seldom
returned before evening.
</p><p>
Later
in the day the American and English
girls started out together. They were
in
me, of course. They were both in a
happy mood, Beryl chattering on and
on to
the little English girl who lay back
with a pretty dreamy smile playing
about
her mouth and eyes. Once she said
very gently, "I shall always love
Japan,
Beryl,
because&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;shall
have been so happy here."
</p><p>
"Do you know," said Beryl, studying
her curiously, "that if I were in
your place I should be perfectly
wretched
till I was with him, yet you seem as
happy as if you were really together.
How <hi rend="italic">can</hi>
you
wait so patiently? I should be in a
fit of nervousness all the time,
especially now when you are so near
to him
and&mdash;"
</p><p>
"You see I have grown used to it,"
Elinore answered, smiling at the
other girl's impetuosity, "and now
the waiting
is almost over. That makes me so
happy." She grew quite fluent, and
began telling Beryl about herself.
</p><p>
"We have been engaged three years
now," she said. "When father was
alive he would not consent to our
marrying. We
had to wait. Father did not like
Ernest;" she stirred uneasily. "After
he, father, was gone, why we became
engaged
and mother and brother were <hi
rend="italic">so</hi> good about
it. But&mdash;but brother thought we
ought to
wait a while and he got Ernest to
think that way, too. You see Ernest
was poor&mdash;quite poor&mdash;with
such a
very little income. I don't think
brother really wanted us to marry,
but&mdash;" she smiled, "he always
did give in
to <hi rend="italic">me.</hi> So

we became engaged and they said that
must satisfy me for the time being. I

think brother thought we'd run off
and get married some time, and that
was why before starting out on his
trip he
persuaded Ernest to accompany him. I
cried dreadfully over it at the time,
for I did not know when I would see
them
again. But I got used to it, and
Ernest used to write me such dear
letters. Brother grew quite fond of
Ernest&mdash;he couldn't help
it&mdash;and it was at <hi
rend="italic">his</hi> suggestion
that I finally came
here. We have not seen each other for
three years. I have never loved,
never hardly thought of, or looked at
another man but&mdash;Ernest. Beryl
dear&mdash;" the little hand in the
American girl's was begging for her
sympathetic understanding. "Ah!
Beryl, you do not know how I love
him."
</p><p>

But the American girl did know.
</p><p>
"You
are such an intense little thing,"
she said slowly. "Oh! Elinore, I
wouldn't
love any man too much. They are not
worth it."
</p><p>
From
whence got she this bitter cynicism?
The American girl was the younger by

perhaps three years, but she had
lived in the world, the big universal
world,
where the other girl had lived in a
tiny one of her own. Her remark
shocked
Elinore.
</p><p>
"Beryl!" she faltered.
</p><p>
"There! I didn't mean that," Beryl
said, impatient with herself. "I
meant that&mdash;that
you English girls make godheads out
of your men."
</p><p>
"Don't&mdash;don't
you love brother Frank very much?"
asked the other timidly, "Is he not
worth
all the love in the world?"
</p><p>
The American girl laughed.
</p><p>
"No&mdash;indeed no; he is not! <hi
rend="italic">My</hi> love is
sufficient for him."
</p><p>
"Oh!
I meant that," Elinore said with
great relief.
</p><p>
"I
know, dear," Beryl continued. "Still,
I don't love him quite the way you
would.
I don't, I <hi
rend="italic">won't worship</hi>
him. If there is any worshiping to be
done,
why, he can do it. But there, let's
talk of something else. See that
pretty
little house over there? Isn't it
sweet? Looks as if t'were made of
bright
sugar candy, like the candy houses in
the fairy books. Well, dear, we've
come
an awful long way, and I'm a wee bit
hungry and thirsty. Suppose we get
out
here, trot up that hill and beg of
the good fairy who is bound to be in
that
delightful fairy cottage, something
to eat and drink. Ho! Mister runner,

the&mdash;ah&mdash;selfish heart of
thirstiness thirsty is," she laughed
at the jumble
she made of the Japanese formal and
polite request for water, which she
had
once had translated to her. I believe
it was thus: "The throat of
selfishness
thirst is."
</p><p>
As
they approached the little house,
they could see the figure of a
Japanese girl
framed in the doorway. She seemed but
a part of and added to the beauty of
the
scene. The two girls paused in the
bushes to look at the pretty picture.
The
Japanese girl was very small and
dainty. She had a rose colored kimono
on, and
red poppies in her hair and <hi
rend="italic">obi.</hi> Her
little hands&mdash;such pretty,
dainty,
slender little ones, were clasped
together, and the girl was quietly
dreaming,
all unconscious of the sweet picture
she presented.
</p><p>
"I
will do without drink or food for a
moment," Beryl whispered, with the
excited
enthusiasm of an artist. "Oh! my
camera&mdash;I can't wait to sketch
it." She turned
the camera toward the doorway, and
then&mdash;
</p><p>
A
man's voice, a lazy, mellow,
caressing voice, broke the stillness
of the summer
quiet.
</p><p>
"Well,
and what is my little Jap dreaming
of?" He had come from out the
cottage, and
now stood with his arms about the
little figure in the doorway. The
girl raised
a radiant adoring face to his, and
flung her arms with all the abandon
and
delight of her nature about her neck.
"Of <hi rend="italic">you!</hi>"
she said. "Oh! <hi
rend="italic">eijin-san,</hi>
<hi rend="italic">you</hi> are so
good to come bag at me agin."
</p><p>
The American girl
shut up her camera with a delighted
bang, and turned to her companion.
</p><p>
The
English girl's face was white as
death, and she was staring with fixed
eyes of
despair and horror straight before
her.
</p><p>
The
figures in the doorway had
disappeared.
</p><p>
"Elinore!"
the American girl shook her arm,
"Good gracious! what is it, dear?"
</p><p>
The
girl opened her pale lips to reply,
but no sound escaped them.
</p><p>
"Elinore,
Elinore&mdash;you are going to
faint." She dropped the camera and
supported the
girl.
</p><p>
The
man in the little Japanese house must
have heard their voices, for they
were
quite near at hand. He came toward
them, peering into the bushes.
</p><p>
"Any one there?" he called.
</p><p>
"Yes,"
the American girl answered before the
other girl could stop her. Elinore
had by
this time somewhat recovered her
strength, and was standing very
erect. She
took a few forced steps toward the
man, followed by Beryl, and
</p>
<pb n="29"/><p>
there in the open, right before the
little Japanese woman, who had
quietly joined the man, she faced
him. Had a
wraith suddenly arisen from the grave
the man could not have grown whiter
or
shown more abject fear and
consternation. For a long moment no
one spoke a
word. Then the man took a step toward
the English girl, his arms half
outstretched.
</p><p>
"Elinore,"
he said, and the piercing tenderness
in his voice was not feigned. But the
girl
withered him with a look of utter
scorn.
</p><p>
"Don't
dare&mdash;dare touch me," she said
in a passionate whisper.
"No&mdash;you&mdash;." She could
say no more&mdash;but stood still in
the path, a white, accusing, dumb
figure.
</p><p>
In
a flash the American girl understood.
She placed herself before the
trembling
English girl, and her voice vibrated
with her scorn.
</p><p>
"<hi
rend="italic">No</hi>&mdash;<hi
rend="italic">don't</hi>&mdash;<hi
rend="italic">dare</hi>&mdash;<hi
rend="italic">touch</hi>&mdash;<hi
rend="italic">her</hi>&mdash;<hi
rend="italic">you</hi>&mdash;<hi
rend="italic">you
hound!</hi>" she cried. "Oh! we are
only women. We can't answer or speak
to
you&mdash;such as <hi
rend="italic">you,</hi>
but&mdash;Elinore has a
brother&mdash;she&mdash;. Ah!" she
changed
her tone; "Don't think that Elinore
wants you&mdash;<hi
rend="italic">you.</hi> She
don't. She would
not touch you with a stick."
</p><p>
The
man ignored her. All his mind and
heart were centered on the other
girl.
</p><p>
"Elinore,
forgive me. I can explain&mdash;"
</p><p>
The
English girl was weakening. She would
have broken down but for her friend.
That
young woman was burning with
indignation sufficient for both of
them.
</p><p>
"Who
is that Japanese woman?" she
demanded.
</p><p>
Again
the man ignored her, his eyes fixed
imploringly on Elinore.
</p><p>
Beryl
turned to the Japanese girl, who had
been regarding them all with puzzled
eyes.
</p><p>
"Who
is he? What is he to you?" she
demanded imperiously.
</p><p>
The
Japanese girl smiled. She looked with
great pride at the man, and
then&mdash; "Aa!
Tha's Mister Ernest Crowder. Tha's my
hosban'. Me? I Mrs. Ernest
Crowder&mdash;tha's
<hi rend="italic">me.</hi> How
nize thad is!"
</p><p>
"No,
no!" the man burst out fiercely, "It
is not true. It was a&mdash;I&mdash;"

</p><p>
"We
understand," Beryl said, with cold
contempt. "A Japanese marriage! We,
Elinore
and I, consider it as binding as any
other, and&mdash;but we are wasting
our time on
you. Come, Elinore," she turned to
the girl, "Let us leave Mr. And Mrs.

Crowder." The man attempted to stay
them. He caught hold of Elinore's
hand, and
held on to it desperately. The
American girl's voice was relentless
as fate.
</p><p>
"For
Elinore's sake we would keep it from
her brother, but, if you dare to hold

us&mdash;her&mdash;I'll tell him
everything, and he will thrash you
within an inch of
your life," she said slowly.
</p><p>
The
man's excitement had vanished
somewhat. He held himself in check.
</p><p>
"Who
are you and what business is it of
yours? You have no proof of anything
against
me&mdash;and Elinore, <hi
rend="italic">my</hi> Elinore,
would not turn against me."
</p><p>
"No
proof?" the girl echoed, scornfully.
"As soon as I get home I will develop
and
send you proofs of a certain picture
I took of you and that Japanese woman
in
the doorway."
</p><p>
The
man had turned a sick gray color. He
did not try to hold them after that.
Not
one word did the English girl say all
the way home. Beryl held the dumb
white
figure in her arms, and begged her to
say something&mdash;if only a
word&mdash;but the
girl seemed as if turned to stone,
and sat looking straight before her,
with a
white, set countenance. She did not
even hear the other girl's voice, for

hearing, speech, memory&mdash;all
seemed to have gone. When they
reached the hotel,
the American girl alighted first.
Montrose was at the door, and went
down to
the gate to meet them. He saw the
figure in the vehicle and staggered
back as
if shot.
</p><p>
"My
God!"
</p><p>
"She&mdash;it
is&mdash;a sunstroke," the American
girl began, and broke down. "Oh, no,
no," she
wailed, "You shall know the
truth&mdash;she&mdash;she has seen
<hi rend="italic">him.</hi>"
</p><p>
"Him?"
</p><p>
"Yes&mdash;Ernest
Crowder."
</p><p>
"And?"
</p><p>
"I
will show you something that will
explain to-morrow."
</p>

     <p>Ernest Crowder hung like a
dog around the hotel where the
English girl lay dying. He would
waylay the
doctors, the
nurses, Beryl, and even Montrose, and
beg to be allowed to
go to her, declaring over and over
that he loved her only.
But the brother and Beryl had no
mercy on him, and the man
grew thin and haggard as a wraith.
But one day when Beryl
came from out the sick room, the man
again tried to soften
her, and repeated his prayer.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Let me see her only once
for a moment, for God's sake.
I have suffered&mdash;atoned a
thousand times over. It is killing
me&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>
     The tears were gone from Beryl's
eyes. They grew hard
and cold as steel.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;you may come in now&mdash;and
see her.&rdquo;</p><p>
     She pushed the door open, and
the man, fearful that she
might change her mind, rushed in
ahead of her.</p><p>
     The English girl was lying back
among the white
pillows, but her face was whiter than
they. Her eyes were
closed, and the soft fair hair was
scattered in loving rich
profusion about the pillows. She was
dead.</p><p>
     The man threw himself on his
knees and gave way to his
grief and contrition, sobbing and
talking incoherently like
a little, fever-sick child, covering
the cold little hands
with his kisses, and imploring her to
speak one word to him.
I heard them speak of it
afterwards&mdash;those who had
witnessed
this meeting&mdash;and I would have
felt sorry for the young man
but for some events which occurred
subsequently.</p><p>
     A few days after the burial of
Elinore Montrose, the
young Japanese woman who had called
herself Crowder's wife,
came down from the little house on
the hill with Crowder's
little two-year-old daughter, and
went to the English hotel
in search of the man she considered
her husband. It happened
that Beryl Evans encountered her, and
though her first
impulse was to avoid the girl whom
she held partially
responsible for her friend's death,
yet her better sense
triumphed, and she could not resist
the girl's wistful,
friendly smile as she saw and
recognized Beryl's face among
all the strangers who were sitting on
the hotel piazza.</p><p>
     &ldquo;You want to
see&mdash;?&rdquo; Beryl began, as
the Japanese girl
hesitated, abashed before so many
strangers.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Ah! kin' Americazan
ladys, I lig' say something to my
hosban', thad Mister Ernest Crowder.
Ah! that's nize day.
Your health is good?&rdquo; she
hastened to add.</p><p>
     It was impossible to be cold or
even frigidly polite
before this morsel of good will and
confidence.</p><p>
     &ldquo;He is somewhere about the
hotel, doubtless,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Wait, I'll have a boy tell
him.&rdquo;</p><p>
     She had drawn the girl into the
parlors, and was
unconsciously caressing the child's
little hand, which had
found the way into hers.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Is&mdash;is this your
little girl?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yaes.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;And his, I
suppose,&rdquo; she added
bitterly.</p><p>
     &ldquo;His? How is thad? Ah,
yaes, of course&mdash;I nod vaery
clever nod for to onderstan'. Yaes,
thad Mr. Ernest Crowder
liddle girl.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Beryl was
stifling at the thought. &ldquo;How
many
children have you?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Two&mdash;jus two liddle
girls.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Two?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Ah! I see you mag'
mistake&mdash;nod onderstan'? Nudder
one
b'long nudder hosban',&rdquo; smiled
the Japanese girl. &ldquo;Thad
hosban' daed long time ago. I nod luf
with him vaery much,
jus' liddle bit, but what kin I do. I
got marry thad hosban'
account I am vaery poor. But thad Mr.
Ernest Crowder how he
mag' me luf with him!&rdquo; She
sighed with ecstatic memory.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Where's your other
child?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;I leave at home. Thad
Mistero Ernest Crowder prefer
his liddle girl. Ha! you thing so?
Well, me? I want please
thad Mr. Ernest Crowder all with my
heart&mdash;because,&rdquo; her
eyes grew very tender again, &ldquo;I
luf with him so moach.&rdquo;</p><p>
     The American girl closed her
eyes to shut out the
girl's happy face. In her heart she
was resenting and
begrudging the happiness which she
thought ought to have
gone to Elinore.</p><p>
     Crowder came into the room,
unwillingly, nervously. He
was sick and restless, and perhaps
was not wholly
responsible for his cruelty.</p><p>
     &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;
he asked the Japanese girl. She
advanced joyously, confidently toward
him, and now stood
back a pace, marveling at the man's
changed and stern voice.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Thad you nod cum see me
for so long,&rdquo; she began
timidly.</p><p>
     He interrupted her impatiently.
&ldquo;You had better
understand,&rdquo; he said brutally,
&ldquo;that I am not coming back
again at all. This means, according
to your law&mdash;that&mdash;I
have divorced you&mdash;if you hold
to that marriage stuff.&rdquo;</p><p>
     The girl had grown very white
and was regarding him
with pitiful, scared eyes.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Bud you mek me luf with
you,&rdquo; she said falteringly,
&ldquo;an' I bin mos' vaery good. An'
thad liddle bebby. You&mdash;you
nod goin' ter desert me sure
thing?&rdquo; She had had examples
over and over of such cases in
foreign marriages, but she
still clung to a vain hope that he
was only teasing her, as
he had been so fond of doing in the
past.</p><p>
     The man was regarding her with
cold eyes of dislike. To
him all her charm was now gone, and
he even laid his misery
at the door.</p><p>
     &ldquo;The child?&mdash;well,
according to your law, again, I am
entitled to it. But you may keep her.
I will provide, of
course, and you&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>
     Beryl broke in here. The man's
heartlessness maddened
her.</p><p>
     &ldquo;You don't mean to say you
would disown&mdash;desert your
own wife and child!&rdquo;</p><p>
     He looked her full in the face
now.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and in this case I will not
tolerate
your interference. Had you not
prevented my seeing Elinore,
I could have made my peace with
her&mdash;perhaps saved her
life.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes, and it is better
then that she is dead,&rdquo; the
girl
said passionately.</p><p>
     He closed his lips with grim
pain, and continued
slowly:</p><p>
     &ldquo;To-morrow I sail by the
Empress of India. God knows
where I am
going&mdash;anywhere&mdash;only to
forget. I loved her, do
you
understand&mdash;Elinore&mdash;not
this woman.&rdquo; He turned to the
Japanese girl. &ldquo;You had better
go home now,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yaes,&rdquo; she said
obediently, but she did not
stir.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked
commandingly, and she with one
sorrowful look at his face went
slowly out of the house.</p><p>
     &ldquo;You pitiful
coward!&rdquo; the American girl
said, but he
was regardless of her or anyone's
scorn now.</p><p>
     Next day the Japanese girl
walked all the way to the
wharf to make sure that he was going
away. She watched him
sitting on deck, his cap pulled over
his eyes, moodily
looking out across the bay. And after
the boat had passed
out of sight, she climbed the hill
with very slow and weary
steps.</p><p>
     Later she opened a vein and bled
to death.</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="5a" id="d9"><head>V.</head>

     <p>Ever since the Japanese girl
had visited her, Beryl had
been reproaching herself because she
fancied that she might
have been kinder to her. Beryl Evans
was a creature of
impulse. She could not bear to think
of anyone in pain, and
so could not forget the white,
wistful, wounded face of the
Japanese girl. She wondered whether
she was actually
suffering. Somebody had told her that
they did not suffer
much&mdash;these Japanese
women&mdash;they had so little heart!
But
Beryl was not so sure of
this&mdash;and, besides, did they not
also add to this that so many of her
countrywomen had
created hearts in them. That was the
American conceit, she
thought. The Japanese women did have
hearts&mdash;only they did
not show it&mdash;and so when some of
them did love a foreigner
then the foreigners took the full
credit of awakening the
heart, not merely in the one woman,
but the race itself. Her
thoughts tortured her so that she
confided in her brother,
Philip, a young fellow of eighteen
who was with her. She
shrank from telling Montrose, fearing
that the mention of
the Japanese girl would recall more
vividly to him his
sister's sad death.</p><p>
     &ldquo;You see, Phil,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;it wasn't her fault at
all.
She never knew anything about
Elinore, and he was so cruel
to her.&rdquo;</p><p>
     Philip proposed that they pay
her a visit, and
accordingly, they set out for that
purpose. It was only the
day after the Japanese girl had
killed herself, so that when
they reached the little house, they
(having heard nothing of
the tragedy) were astonished to hear
the sounds of loud
weeping in the house.</p><p>
     In answer to their knock, an
amazing horde of Japanese
came outside. They were inclined to
be brusque and hostile
to the strangers, for they fancied
them to be relatives of
Crowder, and it was only after a good
deal of persuasion and
diplomacy on the part of Beryl and
her brother that they
consented to their entering the
house.</p><p>
     When Beryl saw the dead Japanese
girl reposing on a bed
of cherry and wild plum blossoms, she
became so weak that
she sank down to the floor, and
laying her head against the
cot on which the girl was lying, wept
as if she had been a
near and dear friend to her.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Oh, think of it,
Phil&mdash;two of them&mdash;both so
good and
lovely&mdash;for him&mdash;a thing
like him.&rdquo;</p><p>
     She turned to the relative who
had acted as spokesman
to them.</p><p>
     &ldquo;What will become of the
children? Who will take
them?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;All the relatives were
willing and even eager to have
her oldest child&mdash;who was, like
themselves, a Japanese girl-
-but as for the other&mdash;the
little one with the sun in her
hair and eyes,&rdquo; he shrugged his
shoulders, &ldquo;he himself had
not much use for the half-castes.
They were usually good-for-
nothing&mdash;erratic, hot-tempered,
jealous&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>
     Yes, Beryl and Philip had
already heard of the isolated
lives of the half-castes. Who that
has lived in Japan has
not known of it?</p>

<div2 type="section" n="5b" id="d11">

     <p>The older child was being
made much of among the
relatives, but the little one was
crying passionately for
her mother in a corner by herself. My
runner had taken a
circuitous path up the hill to the
house, and I could see
directly into the room, and, indeed,
hear all that passed.
I, however, only caught a dim glimpse
of the older child.
She went over to her little sister
once and endeavored to
comfort her, but was called away by
some bitter relative.</p><p>
     Phil Evans took the sobbing
little one in his arms, and
brushed the tangled curls out of her
eyes. They were larger
than Japanese eyes, and so bright.
They looked right into
the young man's face as though trying
to read it. Something
in the expression of genuine
tenderness and pity for her
assured her that she was with a
friend. She let her little
restless head sink contentedly on his
shoulder, while one
little hand stole caressingly to his
face.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Oo, such nize mans. Koto
so tired,&rdquo; she murmured in
almost unintelligible English, and a
few minutes afterward
was asleep.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Come, Phil. We must go
now,&rdquo; his sister told him after
a while. He had wandered outside the
house, and was sitting
on the trunk of a fallen tree,
looking thoughtfully down at
the sleeping child in his arms. She
was the prettiest little
one he had ever seen, and Phil's
weakness lay in his love
for children. Her hair was very black
and silky, but when
the sun touched it, strange gleams of
dark red seemed to
reflect back the light. It was the
child's Saxon blood,
perhaps. A half-caste's hair is
usually either black or dark
red, that is, black hair with red in
it. The little one had
long black silky lashes and russet
red cheeks.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Poor little thing!&rdquo;
murmured Beryl, pityingly, &ldquo;I
suppose its days of love and perhaps
happiness are over now
that its only real friend is
gone&mdash;its mother. These
Japanese despise and dislike it for
its father's sake. They
will neglect it, maybe mistreat
it.&rdquo;</p><p>
     Philip uttered a short, quick
ejaculation, and rose to
his feet.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Beryl, they wouldn't; no
one could be anything but
kind to a dear little thing like
this. No! I won't, I
couldn't believe it. Besides, it is
the nature of the
Japanese to be gentle and tender.
Everyone says so.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Oh, I didn't mean they'd
be cruel exactly, but why,
they'd neglect it, let it alone
altogether. Besides, there
are ways of being cruel to people
without hurting them&mdash;
physically, I mean. We must be going
now, Phil. I promised
Frank to be home soon. He does not
know where we are.&rdquo; She
beckoned to the Japanese to take the
child from him.</p><p>
     &ldquo;What&mdash;who&mdash;will
take care of her?&rdquo; the young
man
questioned.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Tha's whad I
dunno,&rdquo; the man said
indifferently. &ldquo;Mos'
those relatives b'long nudder
hosban'&mdash;nod to the girl. She
have vaery few relatives&mdash;vaery
poor girl when our relative
marry with her.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Oh! then she would not
even be brought up by her own
relatives.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Tha's so,&rdquo; the man
admitted, shrugging his shoulders.
     The young man took a few slow
strides up and down,
holding the little one close to him,
resting his chin
against the little dark head. He
stopped short in his walk
of a sudden.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Can I have her?&rdquo; he
said simply.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Phil, are you
crazy?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;No; I&mdash;I&mdash;never
wanted anything so much in my life
before,&rdquo; he said boyishly.
&ldquo;I'd be good to her, Beryl,
really I would.
I'd&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes, I know all about it.
You'd be good,&rdquo; his sister
was laughing, &ldquo;of course, you
would be&mdash;in your way. You
silly boy. Why, you don't know
anything about bringing a
child up&mdash;the responsibility,
the care, the&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;I'd keep her with me till
she grew a little older, and
then she could go to school like any
other child, and&mdash;why,
Beryl, I
could&mdash;learn.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Learn! Oh, silly, come on
now, like a good boy. Now,
what would Miss Morgan
say?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Miss Morgan? Oh,
I&mdash;I forgot her,&rdquo; he
confessed, a
trifle despondently now.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Forgot Miss Morgan! You
haven't been her shadow for
all these weeks for nothing, have
you?&rdquo;</p><p>
     For the first time in Philip's
life, perhaps, he was
glad of his youth.</p><p>
     &ldquo;No; I like her, of
course,
but&mdash;but&mdash;er&mdash;I'm only
eighteen, you know,
Beryl.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes, eighteen years, too
young to marry,
and&mdash;er&mdash;too
young, certainly, to be a papa of a
baby of two and more.&rdquo;</p><p>
     The young man was hesitating.
The child moved
restlessly in its sleep, sighing, as
children do after
having cried themselves to sleep.
Unconsciously it snuggled
closer in his arms.</p><p>
     &ldquo;I&mdash;I can't&mdash;I
won't give her up,&rdquo; the young
man said.
He turned to the Japanese, and his
voice was quite
determined. &ldquo;Can I have
her?&rdquo;</p><p>
     The man consulted for a while
among the relatives, and
after a short, a very short,
colloquy, informed Philip of
their unanimous consent. He could not
help thinking that
they were glad to be rid of
her.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Just one thing
more,&rdquo; he said, and his voice
had a
full manly ring now. &ldquo;Here is
my permanent address. Any mail
addressed to me there will be
forwarded to me wherever I am.
When this little one's sister is old
enough, and if she
wishes, you will permit her to write
to her?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they
agreed.</p><p>
     &ldquo;And&mdash;&rdquo; he
added, blushing, &ldquo;I will try
and have her
always remember her mother's country
and her sister. We will
take some Japanese woman as maid or
nurse to her, and she
won't forget her own language
then.&rdquo;</p><p>
     And so three, instead of two,
rode back in me to the
hotel. Maybe the small added burden
was responsible for the
creaking I did. But, no, that was
only my joyful laughter. I
could not contain myself, for I was
so happy in their
goodness.</p><p>
     I do not know what he said to
his friends or relatives,
what explanation he made. He was
doubtless independent of
them all, and I know he did not
regret his bargain, for, for
many days before they sailed, I would
see them together,
always together, those two, always
laughing and happy. They
stayed for some months longer on the
island and then one
day, the day after Beryl's marriage
to Montrose, they all
took passage for America, and I saw
the last of them for
many, many years.</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="6" id="d12">
<head>VI.</head>

     <p>Ah, me! it is so pleasant
even for an old jinrikisha to
be loved. Many a time have I sighed
for the days when the
Lady Natsu had loved me for myself,
and yes, even for the
American girl, Beryl Evans. It was
fifteen years since she
had left Japan. How old, how very,
very old I was getting!
Well, well, I wonder why it is that
while old people are
supposed to be treated with so much
care and respect, old
things are cast aside and despised.
Oh, you human beings,
some of you prating about kindness
that ought to be shown to
this and that dumb animal, wild
animals, birds, and even
fishes and insects, I wonder if there
ever were any of you
who paused to realize that inanimate
things, such as chairs
and tables and old jinrikishas, etc.,
have feelings also and
love to be loved. Take my case: I am
extremely sensitive,
and I never have forgotten any one in
my life who has been
kind to me, and I'll add to this, I
have never forgotten any
one who has been unkind. I am only an
old jinrikisha, but my
memory, it is white and black and
bruised with the ill
treatment I have received at the
unscrupulous hands of the
ignorant jinrikisha man who owned me
for a number of years
before that blessed earthquake, of
which I have already told
you, threw me before my new and most
loved master of all.
I'll only say this, that just
previous to that I grew fretty
and cranky, and began to feel and
show my age so badly that
even the children ceased to care to
play in me.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said one
impudent little fellow one day as he
kicked me (that kick remains on me
to-day), &ldquo;the old thing's
all broken down. Let's go and play
somewhere else&rdquo;; and off
they went like the wind, fickle
little jades, only to return
the next day.</p><p>
     Soon after finding me, my
master, who was somewhat of a
lover of antiquities<ref target="n9">[9]</ref>, began
hunting up the records of my
original family. He became very much

<pb n="13"/>

absorbed and interested in his task,
tracing the family back
one generation after another, back of
even my dear master,
Shomu Jokichi; and I am proud to tell
you that the family
record showed one long unbroken line
of nobles, noted for
their kindness, generosity, bravery,
and goodness. My new
master collected old family relics
and heirlooms, and
exhibited them very proudly as being
once the property of
the great Shomu family.</p><p>
     But the crowning act of interest
in the family and
their fallen fortunes was to search
diligently in order to
find if any member of the family were
still alive. To this
end, he employed the most expert
lawyers and even
detectives.</p><p>
     At the end of each week they
would report to him. At
the end of a couple of months the
record consisted as
follows&mdash;I mean dating from the
Lady Natsu&mdash;as those who had
gone before her I was not interested
specially in, and
doubtless you are not either:</p><p>
     &ldquo;First: The Lady Natsu, a
geisha girl&mdash;afterward
married to a poor, but noble, young
man in Kyoto, named
Inouye; offspring from this issue,
one child, also named
Natsu.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Second: Natsu, married
twice, first to a worthy and
well-to-do merchant of Tokyo, named
Nosse, by whom she had
one child, now living, named also
Natsu; secondly, she
married an Englishman, named Crowder,
by whom she had one
child, also living, named 'Koto.'
This child had been
adopted by English people, presumed
to be the relatives of
the said Crowder.&rdquo;</p><p>
     My young master, whose name was
Komatsu Taro, was very
much pleased with all this.</p><p>
     &ldquo;The next thing to be
done,&rdquo; he said, rubbing his
hands
cheerfully together, &ldquo;is to
find the two children now
living. I wish to know
them.&rdquo;</p><p>
     Three days afterward he received
communication that the
eldest daughter, Natsu, had been
found. She was living with
relatives of her father.</p><p>
     Komatsu Taro gave an immense
banquet, to which were
invited all the nobles of his
acquaintance, in order to meet
the young girl, Natsu, and her
relatives, who, though not
themselves descendants of the Shomu
family, were
nevertheless, for her sake,
welcome.</p><p>
     I can tell you I was nearly
bursting with pride and
delight, and my anxiety to see the
young girl who bore the
same name as my beloved little
mistress of the past was
unbounded.</p><p>
     About eight in the evening the
guests began to arrive.
I had a good position from where I
could see each and all
the guests. I could hardly contain
myself in my eagerness to
see the young girl. Scores of guests
passed in at the gate,
but the girl did not make her
appearance till later in the
evening. My master, who had worked
himself up to such a
state of interest in the family, kept
coming over to my
side, and looking about him
expectantly.</p><p>
     When she finally arrived, she
was accompanied by her
relatives, about twenty or thirty in
all.</p><p>
     As she came up the pathway
toward me, for my master was
receiving his guests at my side, I
felt as if the ghost of
my dear young mistress had risen from
the grave, and was now
sweeping down toward me.</p><p>
     I need not describe her to you.
The picture of the dear
Lady Natsu of the past will serve.
The same refined,
delicate beauty, the same sunny sweet
smile, the same little
hands and tiny feet. The gods were
indeed good to me in my
old age!</p><p>
     She bowed low with her relatives
before Komatsu,
murmuring her gratitude for what they
termed his great
condescension for deigning to notice
any one so unworthy.
And he looked at her long and
earnestly.</p><p>
     It was permissible for him to
address and converse with
her. Modern etiquette permitted them
this privilege. Komatsu
was a much traveled man; he had been
educated abroad in
foreign lands, and his eyes had
looked into those of women
whose beauty could dazzle the senses,
but I doubt me if ever
before he had met any one who pleased
him as the little
figure that now stood before him,
quietly and modestly.
Maybe her style of beauty never would
have appealed to a
Western eye, but to a Japanese,
everything about her, from
the crown of her little shiny head to
the tips of her tiny
feet, was the ideal of what is meant
by Japanese beauty.</p><p>
     &ldquo;And you have a
sister?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes, a little
sister,&rdquo; she told him.
&ldquo;She is an
American.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;And is she like
you?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes&mdash;no; not so
honorably homely&mdash;a little bit
like
me, but the sun is in her hair and
eyes.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;And the moon smiles in
yours,&rdquo; said Komatsu
slowly.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Ah, I thank you,&rdquo;
blushed Natsu. &ldquo;You
mean&mdash;that&mdash;I&mdash;I
am beautiful?&rdquo; She marveled at
this, for she had been kept
in great seclusion, and her beauty
had been hidden from her
by her careful relatives, but Komatsu
had learned the
Western art of flattery toward
womankind.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes&mdash;you are
beautiful.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Ah-h!&rdquo; she caught
her breath. The flattery was very
sweet. She wished he would say some
more. &ldquo;Thank you again,&rdquo;
she murmured, with her eyes cast
down.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Once your great-
grandfather rode in and owned this
jinrikisha,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;See, here is his crest. You
are of a
great family.&rdquo;</p><p>
     The girl examined it
curiously.</p><p>
     &ldquo;It is like what my mother
ever worked on my kimono in
gold braid. See?&rdquo; She showed
him a crest on the sleeve of
her gown. He took a long time in
examining it and then
comparing it with that on my back,
and his hands touched
hers, and she blushed and looked down
again.</p><p>
     &ldquo;It is very good of you to
come tonight,&rdquo; he said,
wishing to make her speak
further.</p><p>
     &ldquo;That was so good of you
to invite,&rdquo; she smiled.</p><p>
     And after she had gone out from
his house, Komatsu
rushed off to his relatives and to
the nakoda like a
possessed man.</p><p>
     &ldquo;I must have her&mdash;all
my goods, my land, everything I
possess is hers. Haste thee! Make
good labor to secure her
for me for bride.&rdquo; Komatsu's
brain was filled with fire, a
restlessness and desire to possess
her, and after the formal
fashion of the rich Japanese they
became betrothed. The girl
was not loath. She had been very much
attracted by Komatsu,
and her relatives smiled on the union
also.</p><p>
     But one thing delayed the
wedding. The girl, who had
kept up a correspondence with her
sister ever since they
could write, was anxious to have her
attend the wedding.
They were waiting for her to come. At
the time the news of
her sister's betrothal reached her,
the young girl was in
England, where she was studying. It
was such a sweet letter
she wrote her sister that I want to
reproduce it here:</p><p>
     &ldquo;My little big
sister,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;I know
you are little
even though you always like to call
yourself my big sister,
because, forsooth, you are two paltry
years older than I!
What can I say that will half express
my heart's desire that
all good happiness and joy may be
yours?</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes, I am coming. I have
written to him, my dear
guardian, whom I have not seen now
for nearly five years&mdash;
ever since I have been studying my
music, in fact, and he
has cabled me to go at once.
Moreover, he, too, is going to
repeat his visit to Japan. He says it
is fifteen years since
he was there, and that he was a boy
then. And for me? It is
indeed about time that I visited my
home that I love, though
I may not remember it, for what are
the memories of a child
of two? Await me then, dear sister,
and may all the gods of
Japan, and all the world, smile on
you. Koto.&rdquo;</p>

     <p>He had come out on the same
steamer as Koto, and report
had it among the passengers that he
was in love with her. He
was good looking after a fashion,
tall and athletic, with
even features, a little brown
moustache, and large, rather
sentimental eyes. He was an all-
around nice young fellow,
one of the kind that girls invariably
fall in love with.</p><p>
     When Koto moved all her
belongings into the little
house where her sister lived with an
old uncle and aunt, and
announced that she proposed living in
Japanese style while
she was in Japan, Jack had looked
dubious, and expressed it
as his opinion that she never would
get used to living like
the Japanese, after her long
residence among &ldquo;God's chosen
people.&rdquo; His advice to her was,
&ldquo;Stay at the American hotel
by all means, and enjoy Japan through
colored glasses.&rdquo; I
believe some old globe-trotter had
given Jack this same
advice before he had started out on
his trip to Japan. But
Koto was unalterable in her
resolve.</p><p>
     &ldquo;No, sir; I'm going to
live with Natsu for&mdash;hm! The
rest of her maiden days,&rdquo; she
said emphatically.</p><p>
     Jack Carruthers moped around the
hotel for a few days
after she left, feeling desperately
lonely and blue, and
then with a grim sort of feeling that
was divorced from the
better part of himself, he set out to
hunt up the little
house where Koto now lived, and which
Jack thought was a
&ldquo;doosid&rdquo; long way from
the &ldquo;doosid&rdquo;
hotel.</p><p>
     Arrived there, he was met at the
door by Koto herself,
and being a stranger to Japan and
things Japanese, he fell
an easy victim. The first impression
a stranger has on
entering a Japanese house is that the
dainty, pretty, and
altogether charming little house
reminds him of some vague
picture in a fairyland scene, or an
Elysian dream. Then just
as he has<ref target="n10">[10]</ref> arrived at
this conclusion, some little doll of
a
Japanese girl (generally happening to
be especially pretty
at this time, too) will arrive on the
scene, and the
harshest critic immediately becomes
an ardent admirer. So it
was with Carruthers.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Well&mdash;ah&mdash;upon
my word, Miss Crowder, this is
a&mdash;er&mdash;
most chawming little place;
delightful&mdash;ah&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo; he stopped
short, and stared with fascinated
eyes toward the fusuma
which was slowly sliding apart.</p>

<div2 type="section" n="7b" id="d15">

     <p>Then through the parted shoji
the most wonderful little
figure Jack had ever seen issued. At
first he noticed only
the strange dazzling of bright
colors, dashes of red,
yellow, green, blue; and he noticed
that there were bright
poppies in her hair, held in place by
shining kanzhashi<ref target="n11">[11]</ref>.
Half way across the room, she made
her prostration; this
before he had time to even look at
her face, and then for a
long time Jack saw nothing but a
delightful little bobbing
head and the lightning glance of the
brightest eyes.</p><p>
     He put his two hands in his
pockets and stared with all
his eyes. Then he turned for
enlightenment to Koto. She was
smiling, and was regarding the pretty
picture with as much
pleasure as he.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Oh, he isn't an 'august
excellency,' Natsu. You waste
your courtesies on him&mdash;he is
only&mdash;&rdquo; she smiled
provokingly
at him, and Natsu stopped bowing and
rose promptly to her
feet, very much flushed and shy, her
little head drooping in
the most charming manner
imaginable.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Come over here and meet
Mr. Carruthers, Natsu, the
Honorable Jack Carruthers. Can you
say that?</p><p>
     Natsu's eyes were fixed
studiously on the toes of
Jack's shoes. She raised them very
timidly.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Mister Onble Jag
Ca&mdash;Ca&mdash;I kin nod say thad
other.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Never mind. Call him just
'Jack.' Every one does.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jack,
who had found his speech as quickly
as she had herself spoken.
&ldquo;Call me
just&mdash;ah&mdash;Jack. It will-
-er&mdash;sound
so&mdash;ah&mdash;bewitching from
you, don't you know?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;You lig' me call you
thad?&rdquo; she asked shyly.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Jag!&rdquo; said Natsu
promptly.</p><p>
     He laughed outright.</p><p>
     &ldquo;I meant, of
course&mdash;when you addressed me,
you know.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;&mdash;dressed?&rdquo;
she did not understand.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes,
addressed&mdash;ah&mdash;spoke to
me.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yaes, I spoke at you
then. Jus' say 'Jag.' Tha's mos'
nize name I aever
heard!&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Ah, it's a common
one,&rdquo; the young man said
modestly.
&ldquo;Where did
you&mdash;er&mdash;learn to speak
English&mdash;so
chawmingly?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Oh, I nod
speag&mdash;whad is
thad?&mdash;chomin&mdash;ly!&rdquo;
She
mimicked his voice with a pretty
grimace.</p><p>
     &ldquo;It
means&mdash;chawmingly, of course. I
mean, nicely,&rdquo; he
added hastily as he caught a glimpse
of Koto's laughing
eyes.</p><p>
     &ldquo;You thing' I speag'
chomin&mdash;ly nize?&rdquo;
questioned Natsu
very sweetly.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Thangs.&rdquo;</p><p>
     She brought a mat, and he
understood that she expected
him to sit on it. Jack reached the
floor with alacrity, for
you see she was already there
herself, and she looked so
inviting.</p><p>
     And this is how they met, Jack
Carruthers and Natsu.</p><p>
     I do not know what the girl's
thoughts were in regard
to him, but when the young man was
leaving that evening he
said to Koto almost imploringly.
&ldquo;May I not come here again,
as often as I want, I
mean?&rdquo;</p><p>
     Koto smiled indulgently.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Ask Natsu,&rdquo; she
said.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Natsu&mdash;&rdquo; he
repeated the name softly, &ldquo;may
I?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yaes.&rdquo;</p><p>
     When the two girls were alone
together, Natsu said very
quietly to her sister:</p><p>
     &ldquo;You lig' thad Mister
Omble Jag Cuthers vaery
much?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes, very
much.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Aa! an you lig' me be
kin' with him?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes. You see he was
awfully good to me in lots of
ways. On the voyage out, and since I
reached here&mdash;looking
after my luggage and things like
a&mdash;a porter; and he is so
anxious to know all about Japan,
especially since he has met
you. So you give him some lessons,
Natsu.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yaes,&rdquo; assented the
Japanese girl very willingly.
&ldquo;I
tich' thad Omble Jag Cuthers be lig'
Japanese. Whad you
thing?&rdquo;</p><p>
     And she kept her word. Before
Jack had been barely two
weeks on the island he was madly
infatuated with everything
Japanese. He had the
&ldquo;fever,&rdquo; in fact.</p><p>
     The two sisters were as unlike
each other as the night
from the day. It would be hard to
determine which one was
the prettiest or the most charming.
In her queer quaint way,
nothing could have been more
bewitching than little Natsu.</p><p>
     But Koto was beautiful, with a
wild, inexplicable
beauty that defied description. She
did not look Japanese;
she did not look American. Her face
was mysterious in its
mixed beauty, but the immeasurable
wistfulness of the half-
caste was stamped indelibly on her
features and reflected in
the somber depths of her great, dark
eyes. There were glints
of red and sunlight in her hair and
eyes, which made them
superbly lovely, and there was a rich
flush and glow
constantly in her cheeks, which made
her dusky beauty doubly
alluring. Although but a child in
age, but seventeen at this
time, and two years younger than
Natsu, yet she seemed much
older than her sister.</p><p>
     When Natsu talked to her very
shyly at first and then
very confidently about her
&ldquo;honorably august
betrothed,&rdquo;
Koto, who was at the most romantic
age, would wish ardently
to know whether he was &ldquo;in
love&rdquo; with her, &ldquo;what he
said to
her?&rdquo; and all the rest.</p><p>
     Natsu was amazed and puzzled at
these questions.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Luf?&mdash;no. Of course,
the august Komatsu Taro had never
told her he loved her. Who ever heard
of such a thing! Did
the honorably august Americans do so?
How fonny! How nize!&rdquo;
and she sighed with vivid
imagination.</p><p>
     &ldquo;You don't mean to tell
me,&rdquo; said Koto slowly, pausing
in the act of brushing her long hair,
&ldquo;that you are marrying
without love! That&mdash;oh! oh! You
shan't! you mustn't!&rdquo;</p><p>
     She put the brush down, and sat
opposite Natsu,
regarding her with severe
seriousness.</p><p>
     &ldquo;You will be dreadfully
unhappy if you marry without
love. I know all about it. The girls
used to talk it over,
and we all made up our minds we never
would marry for
anything but love. Why, Natsu, that's
the most&mdash;the most&mdash;
the greatest feeling we are capable
of&mdash;the most worthy, the
truest&mdash;it makes us almost
divine.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;You thing' so.&rdquo;
Natsu was intoxicated at such a
description. &ldquo;Tell me
more&mdash;say some more 'bout thad
luf,&rdquo;
she begged. But her sister's
impulsive passion had sobered
down.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Japanese girl naever
luf&mdash;nod onerstan to luf,&rdquo;
continued Natsu timidly, thinking to
provoke another such
outburst from her sister. Natsu had
lived always in an
atmosphere of suppressed feeling. She
herself was demure and
very meek in deportment, but at heart
she did admire fire
and life, though she would have felt
it sacrilegious to have
admitted this.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Oh, you're so different
from us,&rdquo; said Koto somewhat
despairingly. &ldquo;Still, Natsu,
you are different, too, from
the Japanese, because you have an
American sister, don't you
see?&rdquo;</p><p>
     Natsu said she saw.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Well, then, miss, you
have no business whatever to
marry for anything

<pb n="12"/>

but love, you understand? And I
won't&mdash;no, I'll refuse to
give my consent to any union save for
that reason.&rdquo;</p><p>
     Koto really felt very much
concerned about her sister,
and lay awake the entire night
thinking the matter over.</p><p>
     &ldquo;And to think I was so
glad at the idea of her
marrying. I'm afraid that I can't let
a Japanese have her
after all, though I did want her to
marry one of them;
still, they never love, she says, and
Natsu shan't go
through life without being
loved.&rdquo;</p><p>
     Natsu remained awake, too, but
her thoughts ran riot
and were in great confusion. Hitherto
the word &ldquo;love&rdquo; had
not existed in her vocabulary at all.
Her relatives, and,
indeed, she herself had come to
believe that a marriage with
Komatsu Taro would mean the acme of
bliss. But here was her
clever and beautiful worldly sister,
whom Natsu had always
looked up to in a vague sort of way,
without knowing why she
did so, telling her that it was a
sin, a crime, to marry
without love, and Natsu wished so
much to be free of sin.
And she had said, moreover, that she
would be unhappy all
the rest of her life if she did so.
Natsu desired happiness
above all else. Did she not pray to
all the gods in the
skies each morning to always lighten
her life with this
happiness, even though her august
ancestors (relatives) had
told her it was sinful? She had never
known of any girl
marrying for this love. She would
find out more about it.
Koto, she decided very shrewdly to
herself, was biased in
favor of this love, and, therefore,
was incompetent to give
advice. She would ask some one else.
She did so. Next day
she asked Carruthers, and he
undertook, volunteered, in
fact, to teach her the meaning of the
word in all its
phases. This, he said, would take
time, and he expected her
to be an attentive pupil.</p><p>
     Now all this time my dear master
was in Yokohama, where
he was attending to some important
business. I had been made
as a gift to Natsu, though I still
continued to call him
master to myself.</p><p>
     And so each day I was forced to
be a witness to the
&ldquo;lessons&rdquo; in love given
Natsu by young Carruthers. He was a
very clever, I might say
extraordinary, teacher, and she so
apt a pupil.</p><p>
     I believe the last lesson I saw
him give her consisted
of holding very close in his own her
two little hands, and
drawing them up to his lips, where he
held them a long time,
at the same time looking straight
into the half-troubled,
half-pleased eyes of the girl.</p><p>
     And afterward when he left her,
she looked at the two
silky little hands quite
curiously.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Tha's mos fonny thing I
never seed, thad luf,&rdquo; she
said.</p><p>
     Thus Komatsu Taro had found her.
He stood in the
doorway a long time, looking at the
girl, and all his heart
and soul were in his eyes. Talk of
Japanese not loving!
That's all you foreigners
know.</p><p>
     &ldquo;What is it, ane-
san?&rdquo; (ane-san is the one
endearing
word in the Japanese language), he
asked gently, taking the
same small hands in his, and looking
at them very tenderly.</p><p>
     &ldquo;See,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;he kissed them like
this.&rdquo; She
brought them to her own lips.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Komatsu did
not understand. He thought perhaps
she meant one of her honorable
relatives.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Why&mdash;the Omble Jag
Cuthers!&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;And who is he?&rdquo;
Komatsu had grown white, but his
voice
was sharp and stern in its brevity.
It frightened Natsu. She
had never heard him speak thus, nor
frown so heavily on her.</p><p>
     &ldquo;He&mdash;&rdquo; she
faltered, trembling, &ldquo;just big
red-haired
barbarian&mdash;nice friend for
me.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Ah! I understand,&rdquo;
said Komatsu, who had traveled
much, and knew the world, &ldquo;one
of the brave foreigners from
the west, who undertake to teach our
women strange things.
And so they have found you out
also.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted
Natsu, who did not fully
understand.</p><p>
     &ldquo;And you&mdash;you, Natsu,
should have been proof against
such people,&rdquo; he said slowly,
&ldquo;for you are
betrothed.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Ah&mdash;ah&mdash;&rdquo;
the girl was hesitating between a
momentary
fright and pettishness. She wished
Komatsu Taro was not so
cold. Why could he not teach her this
fascinating &ldquo;luf?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;But I am not betrothed
to you forever,&rdquo; she said with
bewilderment. &ldquo;My sister tells
me not to marry without this
love.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;And you do not love me,
Natsu?&rdquo; He was faltering
now.</p><p>
     She opened her eyes wide, and
stared at him, not
comprehending.</p><p>
     &ldquo;No&mdash;o.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;And you love
this&mdash;this foreigner&mdash;the
barbarian?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;He tich' me thad&mdash;to
onerstan' thad luf.&rdquo; She had
lapsed into broken English.</p><p>
     Komatsu said never a word after
that, but all the light
of his life seemed to wither from his
face.</p><p>
     When he met Koto he was stiffly
polite, cold and
frigidly formal and courteous. She
could not decide whether
to like him or not. Something
somewhat wistful in his
expression when he looked at Natsu
touched and appealed to
her; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; she told
herself, &ldquo;he is too cold to
really love
her. I must see that she, my own dear
little sister, marries
for love only.&rdquo;</p><p>
     All the next day Komatsu stayed
away from the house.
Natsu was nervous and fretful. She
talked constantly of her
&ldquo;august betrothed,&rdquo; but
she was impatient and angry with him
for not coming.</p><p>
     Toward sunset Jack Carruthers
came up the hill and
coaxed her into going out with him
for a little row on the
bay. As they left the house and
passed slowly down the river
road together, Komatsu Taro knocked
on the little door, and
asked of her honorable relatives
permission to see Natsu.
They told him she had gone out on the
bay with the foreign
barbarian friend of her
sister.</p><p>
     And could he see the
sister?</p><p>
     Yes, she was within. Would he
deign to enter their
miserable unworthy hovel?<ref target="n12">[12]</ref></p><p>
     Komatsu addressed Koto entirely
in English, in which
language he conversed excellently,
with the merest accent.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yesterday,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;I had conversation with
your
sister.&rdquo; He paused in order for
her to acknowledge this. The
girl stirred uneasily, wondering what
it was he could have
to say to her.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Will you tell me why you
do not wish her to marry with
me, Miss Koto?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;I&mdash;I not want her to
marry with you!&rdquo; the girl
blushed
with shame. She felt sorry for him
already. &ldquo;Why,
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes, she told
me.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Oh, I told her that she
should not marry for anything
but love, and,&rdquo; firmly,
&ldquo;I meant that.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes, I understand. There
is&mdash;there was surely much
love between us.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Oh, no! she said not
herself.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;She did not know it. The
Japanese have no word for the
emotion. That is all. Why do you
suppose I would wish to
marry with her, unless
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Koto sprang
quite excitedly to her feet. She was
covered with contrition. &ldquo;They
you do love her?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Forever,&rdquo; he said
fervently.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Oh, oh! I am so
glad,&rdquo; she declared
impulsively. &ldquo;I
did really want her to marry some
nice Japanese, and you
were so good to our 'ancestors.' It
seemed a shame for her
to marry without love, and I made up
my mind I'd try and
dissuade her from it.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he was
hesitating painfully.
&ldquo;Do&mdash;you think she-
-your sister, has already love
elsewhere?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;I didn't think of
that;&rdquo; the girl sat down again,
and
looked rather dejected.
&ldquo;He&mdash;he has been with her
so much
lately, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes, she told
me.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;She told you. Oh, isn't
she an innocent sweet little
thing, though? Do&mdash;do you really
love her? Of course you do.
No one could help himself<ref target="n13">[13]</ref>. Well, now I
tell you what, I
really want to help you. I would
rather have you as brother-
in-law than any one I know. Yes, I
really would,&rdquo; she
continued, looking him up and down,
&ldquo;I like you. Now, here's
a bit of advice. Go to Natsu, and
tell her that you love
her. A woman likes to hear that, even
a Japanese woman. Tell
her that&mdash;and&mdash;and make
love to her, if you
can.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;I will try,&rdquo;
Komatsu said seriously, and then he
thanked the girl very
earnestly.</p><p>
     When Jack Carruthers brought
Natsu home it was past
nine, and the spray was in her hair,
and had dampened her
hands and face. Her eyes were
luminous, and yet half
frightened. She had been hearing and
seeing strange things,
mayhap.</p><p>
     Koto took her into her arms, and
quietly drew her down
beside her.</p><p>
     &ldquo;What did he say,
Natsu?&rdquo; she asked.</p><p>
     &ldquo;He say thad&mdash;thad I
luf him.&rdquo;</p><p> &ldquo;Oh&mdash;h! and&mdash;and do
you?&rdquo;</p>
	<p> &ldquo;I donno.&rdquo;</p>

     <p>The next day when Jack called
at the little house Koto
met him alone.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Ah&mdash;er&mdash;where
is Na&mdash;Miss Natsu?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;She went over to see
some of her 'honorable'
relatives. She'll be back soon. Don't
you like to talk to me
any longer, Jack?&rdquo; this last
reproachfully. It made the
young man start and look at her very
sharply, then he stood
still, looking a trifle embarrassed,
holding his silk hat in
his hand. Koto was studying him in a
queer little dissecting
fashion. She couldn't help thinking
how very nice and dressy
he looked in his long Prince Albert
coat and top hat.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Jack, are you in love
with Natsu?&rdquo; she asked
abruptly,
watching his face curiously as she
put the question.</p><p>
     He flushed, surprised at the
sudden query.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Ye&mdash;why, of
course,&rdquo; he began lightly, and
then
looking up, caught the studying
glance of the girl's eyes.
They held him for a moment, and then
he pulled himself
together and stood erect with his
shoulders squared.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Of course I like
her&mdash;who could help it? She is a
dear
little thing.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;H'm! But you don't love
her, do you?&rdquo; Her eyes were
still on his face, as though she
would read the truth there.</p><p>
     He answered promptly this
time.</p>

<div2 type="section" n="8b" id="d18">

  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;ah&mdash;really,
of course not, you
know.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;You don't, then,&rdquo; she
was half musing to herself
now.</p><p>
  It was a long time since she and
Jack had had a really
confidential chat together. She had
purposely left him alone
with Natsu as much as possible, and
perhaps Jack had, for
the delicious time being, while his
mind was full of the
delight of studying and teaching
Natsu, forgotten that he
had once thought himself very much in
love with Koto
herself. She, however, he had always
thought, had never
given him a fair trial. He had never
been sure of her; never
knew whether she liked him or was
just amusing herself with
him.</p><p>
  I don't know what his thoughts were
in regard to the two
sisters just then. One thing was
certain, and that was that
Koto needed to use only a very little
witchery to call him
back to her side. And so she laughed
and talked to him all
that afternoon, and under those
bright, alluring eyes he
forgot almost the very existence of
the other girl. Such is
the nature of some men.</p><p>
  When Natsu came home she found them
sitting together in
the twilight. Koto had seen her
coming up the path and had
purposely gone very near to Jack. He
was looking at her with
the blind intoxicated glance of the
man in love. But Koto's
little play was altogether wasted on
Natsu. That young lady
refused to and indeed could not see
that there was anything
out of the ordinary in the spectacle
they presented. In
fact, it pleased her. She smiled in
artless enjoyment.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Hah, Mister Jag,&rdquo; her
little sibilant voice broke in on
them, &ldquo;tha's lig' you loogin'
ad me also.&rdquo;</p><p>
  They turned to her, the young man
with a rather forced
polite smile, saying
&ldquo;Aw&mdash;yes, of course so.
Indeed?&rdquo; and
Koto with a feigned start, and as
though she was surprised
at her entrance into the room.</p><p>
  Jack had been three weeks teaching
Natsu the meaning of
the Western love. That night, when
Koto had made him realize
that he himself had but learned it,
he told Natsu the
lessons were over. &ldquo;In fact,
Miss
Natsu&mdash;you&mdash;aw&mdash;are a
finished graduate.&rdquo;</p>

<p rend="center">* * *</p>

  <p>"Ah! an&mdash;an I unerstan'
altogether?&rdquo; asked Natsu, not
sure
whether she ought to be joyful or
sad.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Yes&mdash;er&mdash;of
course,&rdquo; he answered lightly,
pulling at his
little moustache, and looking very
nonchalant, for he was
congratulating himself that he had
pulled up in time.</p><p>
  &ldquo;An&mdash;an&mdash;who I
luf?&rdquo; demanded Natsu.</p><p>
  Jack fidgeted.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Why&mdash;ah&mdash;that, of
course, is for you to
say.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Me? Well me, I
thing'&rdquo;&mdash;she went nearer
to him very
confidingly&mdash;&ldquo;thad I
bedder to luf with you. Whad you
thing'?&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;not me. You
see&mdash;er&mdash;my affections
are&mdash;ah&mdash;
already engaged, don't you
know.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Your&mdash;whad is
thad?&rdquo;</p><p>

&ldquo;Affections&mdash;love.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Hah&mdash;your luf
is&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Well, ah&mdash;to be
brief&mdash;I love some one else
already.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;An&mdash;an nod me?&rdquo;
She threw him one dreadful glance of
reproach, and then turned her back on
him, her head
drooping.</p><p>
  She felt bewildered, forsaken,
forlorn. Her heart had been
warmed with a rich understanding of
love, and now it was all
taken from her. And then the memory
of the previous night
was so vivid with her, had been with
her all day, so that
she had thought of nothing else. She
remembered every word
he had said then. They had gotten out
of the boat at a tiny
island and were watching the dying
sunset fade in the west.
She had been irritable and nervous
all the day, and her
heart was hungry for a little
sympathy&mdash;love. She had told
him how she felt.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Mebbe I lig' be luf,&rdquo;
she had said timidly. &ldquo;Whad you
thing'?&rdquo;</p><p>
  For answer Jack had put his arm
quickly about her, and
kissed her lips with such passion
that the girl thrilled
from head to foot.</p><p>
  &ldquo;You shall be, then,&rdquo;
he had whispered.
  Now she was shivering, while he
with his hands in his
pockets was talking carelessly,
jocularly of anything,
everything. Natsu did not know what
he was saying; she only
heard his voice, and it sounded cruel
and hurt her brutally.
  She was very weary that night when
she<ref target="n14">[14]</ref> told
Koto, when
they were in bed together, and her
sister kissed her with
added tenderness, and whispered that
&ldquo;she understood all
about it.&rdquo;</p><p>
  And all through that night Natsu
lay awake.

<pb n="8"/>

Her thoughts were not altogether of
Jack. They were confused-
-and she was thinking more of this
love itself, rather than
the man. She felt as if she had found
something she had been
long seeking, but that, alas! that
something pained and hurt
her. Thereafter never would she know
rest without that love
in her life, that strange Western
love, made up of sweet
words, tender glances, and touches
that thrill, and that
which is unknown to the Japanese,
kisses and caresses.</p><p>
  The first real trouble of her life
had come to her, and
she was like a little child lost in
the dark and crying
vainly for the light, the illusive,
delicious, deceitful
light.</p><p>
  When Komatsu Taro came the next day
Koto gave him warning.
Her quick woman's wit and
understanding took in the
situation and state of the girl's
mind at once, for she had
lived with Natsu long enough to know
of the manner in which
she had been brought up, with an
inexorable law always to
suppress the feelings and emotions.
Love, as she had now
learned it, had come as a revelation
to her, and she was of
that nature to find vent now for all
the suppressed longings
in her heart.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Now don't tell her in words
yet that you love her,&rdquo; Koto
said,
&ldquo;Only&mdash;only&mdash;just let
her feel it&mdash;understand
it.&rdquo; She
looked at him critically. &ldquo;Are
you Westernized enough for
that?&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Alas! yes,&rdquo; said
Komatsu Taro, enigmatically.</p><p>
  She was sitting all alone in the
little room, looking out
of the window and the sun poured all
its wealth on her. Her
chin rested between her two little
hands, and she was
dreaming&mdash;of love perhaps. When
she lifted her eyes to Taro,
they made him sick with jealous pain,
for he understood the
thoughts were not for him.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Of whom do you think, ane-
san?&rdquo; he asked her, sitting
down beside her, closer than a
Japanese usually would.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Of no one,&rdquo; she
answered softly in Japanese.</p><p>
  &ldquo;And do you never think of
me, ane-san?&rdquo; he asked somewhat
sadly. &ldquo;You are never absent
from my thoughts.&rdquo;</p><p>
  Yes, she told him, she thought of
him very often.<ref target="n15">[15]</ref></p><p>
  He drifted quietly into the subject
that absorbed her.</p><p>
  &ldquo;And you like this&mdash;this
love?&rdquo; she asked him,
bewildered
surprise in her eyes.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Yes; why not
I?&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Oh, you are
Japanese.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;And you&mdash;are you not
also Japanese?&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;But I have learned the ways
of the west-ocean
people.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;And I&mdash;have I not lived
among them?&rdquo; He went still
nearer
to her. &ldquo;Ane-san,&rdquo; he
said very gently, &ldquo;this love is
not
foreign to Japan, little one. It is
all about us always. We
know it, feel it, and are happy in
it. It is the secret of
the general happiness here in Japan.
These Westerners teach
us nothing new, only that they would
have us cease
suppressing our feelings. That we
regard the etiquette of
our class in talking not of this love
previous to marriage
is lamentable in some ways,
lamentable where one learns the
lesson unconsciously, perhaps, from a
stranger&mdash;a foreign
barbarian. You are tired, ane-san.
The little heart is
tired. Rest against me.&rdquo;</p><p>
  His words were so tender, so
serious and manly. Even I,
who had learned to love the girl, not
only for her
ancestor's sake but for herself,
could have shaken her for
her lack of understanding. She did
not respond to him, but
answered instead thus.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes, augustness. I am
weary, but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;
she rose,
looking somewhat frightened at the
ardor of his glance, for
never before had Komatsu Taro laid
bare his heart so plainly-
-&ldquo;but I will go to my sister,
and find rest perhaps with
her.&rdquo;</p><p>
  Komatsu Taro grew cold and frigid
under these words. He
bowed low in strict Japanese form as
she passed out of the
room.</p><p>
  She went to her sister and showed
her her little hands.</p><p>
  &ldquo;He too hol' them,&rdquo; she
said.</p><p>
  &ldquo;That was nice. Didn't you
like him to do that?&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;I&mdash;I dunno,&rdquo; said
Natsu. &ldquo;I also lig' that omble
Jag'
Cuthers hol' me my hands thad
sof'.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Oh, he does that to every
girl&mdash;any girl that'll let
him.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Hah! An' Komatsu Taro also
do thad at aeny girl thad led
him?&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;No&mdash;you know he
doesn't. Why don't you love him,
Natsu?
He's awfully nice. I've changed my
mind altogether about
your not marrying him. I'd love to
have him for a brother-in-
law. I declare I'm almost in love
with him myself.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;You!&rdquo; It made Natsu
laugh at the idea. &ldquo;Well, I
thing
thad Komatsu Taro nod goin' ter luf
with you.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Of course not. He is madly
in love with you. Any one can
see it.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Me?&mdash;he luf me! Well I
can nod see thad. Why he nod hol'
me my han's always so sof'?&mdash;why
he nod hol' me&mdash;jus' me
altogether, and kees
me&mdash;lig'&mdash;lig' thad Omble
Jag Cuthers?
He telling me thad thad is thad
luf.</p><p>
  &ldquo;P'raps he
will.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;He! Komatsu
Taro!&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Yes; would you like him
to?&rdquo;</p><p>
  Natsu hung her head shyly. She was
confused. She could not
imagine Komatsu holding her close and
kissing her. She
sighed.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Alas, he nod onderstan' 'to
amberace.'&rdquo;</p><p>
  It was Koto's turn to laugh.</p><p>
  &ldquo;You know, Natsu, embraces,
and kisses, and caresses don't
always prove love. They generally
accompany it&mdash;but they
aren't love. You've got it all mixed
up. I'm sure I don't
know how to explain it to you,
either. Don't know that I
understand it altogether
myself.&rdquo; She pinched her
sister's
cheek. &ldquo;Just give His
Excellency Komatsu Taro a chance to
'amberace' you, and then you'll
see!&rdquo;</p><p>
  She left Natsu all alone, to think
not of the Honorable
Jack Carruthers, but of Taro and the
possibility of him
making love to her in the Western
way. The idea thrilled
Natsu in spite of the impossibility
of it.</p><p>
  &ldquo;What&mdash;Komatsu
Taro!&mdash;the polite, the
circumspect, the
cold!&rdquo;</p><p>
  But her vagrant thoughts would
stray to him, and every
little tender act she had ever known
in connection with him
she recalled to mind, from the time
they had first met and
had smiled in each other's eyes. She
had thought him then an
extraordinarily bold lover because he
had told her of her
beauty. After the betrothal, however,
he had been so careful
in deportment toward her, and in
obeying the etiquette and
rules of the high class. Ah! she was
glad that perhaps after
all he did love her. True, he had
never told her so. But did
her clever sister not say&mdash;that
that was not proof. Natsu
had always thought he desired her for
a bride on account of
her ancestors and maybe because of
her beauty. Love from him
also had not entered into her
calculations. She had not
thought of it even in those days. She
had entered into the
betrothal herself mostly because his
wealth and high
standing dazzled her, and because her
relatives were so
delighted at it. She went to sleep
that night with a smile
on her lips.</p>

                           <p rend="center">* * *</p>

  <p>But next day Komatsu Taro sent
back the betrothal presents
she had made him, and the shock was
such that she almost
staggered as she carried them to her
sister. You see, it
meant that he offered to release her.
Natsu thought it also
meant that he had ceased to care for
her. Her world was
slipping from under her feet.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she said
faintly; &ldquo;thad was
mistake&mdash;he does nod
luf with me.&rdquo; And just then,
one of the servants put her
head into the room and announced that
Komatsu Taro was
below; that he wished the presents
back; he had regretted,
in fact, he had come himself for
them. Koto pushed Natsu out
of the room.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Go down to him,
Natsu&mdash;quick! He needs
you.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Ah! I think maybe you don't
love me?&rdquo; she said pitifully,
when she was before him. Komatsu Taro
smiled. Maybe he
understood. He held his arms out a
moment, and then drew her
into them, just as Jack Carruthers
had done, and he too held
her close and kissed her.</p><p>
  Natsu quivered. She was clinging
unconsciously to him,
letting his kisses reach her lips.
Her little heart was
charged with wonderment, mysterious
delight, for were not
the caresses of Komatsu Taro even
more to her than those of
anyone in all the world? It was that
she had wanted, this
Western manifestation of love, once
felt and understood,
ever after a need, a crying
necessity.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Will you love me, little
Natsu-san?&rdquo; said Komatsu Taro,
&ldquo;or has the heart already gone
to&mdash;&rdquo; He released her a
moment.</p><p>
  The girl was breathless, radiant.
She put herself back
into his arms. &ldquo;No! no!
no!&rdquo; she said,

&ldquo;I did not understand.
I&mdash;ah, Taro-sama, it is you I
love&mdash;
forever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Komatsu Taro and Natsu were
married in the month of
August. The fields were burning with
a vivid glory of natane<ref target="n16">[16]</ref> and azalea blossoms, and the
sun touched their wild crimson
and yellow till they seemed to throb
with life in their
magnificent splendor.</p><p>
  Jack Carruthers was invited and
attended the wedding, for
Natsu had told Komatsu Taro in great
confidence that she
thought &ldquo;there was much love
between him and her honorable
sister.&rdquo;</p><p>
  I was very happy that day, for more
than one reason.</p><p>
  One morning, about a week before
the wedding took place,
and as Taro, Natsu, Koto and Jack sat
at the door, chatting
merrily together, for they were all
great friends now, I saw
a cyclist come riding leisurely
toward the house. He
alighted at the garden gate, pushed
his cap back on his
head, and consulted the number of the
house.</p><p>
  &ldquo;It must be some one from the
hotel,&rdquo; said Koto, as she
went half way down the garden
walk.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Does&mdash;Miss Koto Crowder
live here?&rdquo;</p><p>
  I had heard that voice assuredly
before, and now was
puzzling my old head to know where
and when I had seen him.
He was good to look at, with his fine
wiry figure and keen
clever bronzed face.</p><p>
  &ldquo;I am Miss Crowder,&rdquo;
quoth Koto with grave dignity.</p><p>
  His sharp eyes were taking the
girl in, and as she spoke,
they suddenly softened and melted
into a smile of winning
tenderness.</p><p>
  Have you ever noticed how those
clever clean-shaven faces
with stern critical eyes can become
positively changed and
made to look almost boyish when they
laugh or smile? So it
was with this man. His smile was good
to see, and I had
known but one man who had smiled
thus.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Please open the gate,&rdquo;
he said briskly; &ldquo;I would like
to
kiss you!&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; began Koto
indignantly, blushing beautifully all
the same.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;&mdash;he
was still smiling&mdash;&ldquo;I am
your&mdash;er&mdash;papa&mdash;
Phil Evans. Didn't you expect me? and
don't you know me?&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; said Koto,
and opened the gate with excited
hands.</p><p>
  But when he took the two little
outstretched hands he
satisfied himself by kissing them
only, for you see, he was
not facing the little girl he had
last seen, but a
beautiful, tall young woman.</p>

<div2 type="section" n="9b" id="d21">

<p>&ldquo;To think I didn't know
you!&rdquo; she began, reproaching
herself breathlessly. &ldquo;You
aren't changed a bit. You are
exactly the same. No&mdash;now, take
your hat off. Oh, yes, you
are changed, too, Uncle Phil. There's
some gray on the
temples, but it is so nice. Oh, you
dear, dear, dear old
thing.&rdquo; She slipped her arm
through his, and squeezed it
ecstatically.</p><p>
  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Phil,
comically. &ldquo;The last five years
has been
doing its changing business on you,
instead of me. I'm 'bout
the same, but you?&rdquo; He looked
at her critically. &ldquo;I would
never have known you.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Oh, Uncle Phil!&rdquo; she
reproached.</p><p>
  She introduced him triumphantly to
them all, just as a
young girl might a parent.</p><p>
  As he shook hands with each one
separately, he looked at
them keenly in that quick, sizing-up
way of his.</p><p>
  Koto began to coax him to live with
them, but he laughed
at the idea, lazily declaring that he
was so comfortably
fixed at the hotel he couldn't bother
moving. He added that
she'd better begin packing her little
traps, as he wanted
her with him just as soon as ever
Natsu was married.</p><p>
  &ldquo;We lig' thad she lif with
us,&rdquo; Natsu began
timidly.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Can't help it,&rdquo; said
Philip Evans, smiling at the shy
little figure; &ldquo;I've a prior
claim.&rdquo;</p><p>
  And the day after the wedding he
carried the girl off with
him sure enough. The two sisters
cried at parting, for they
had grown to love each other very
dearly.</p><p>
  &ldquo;I'll come and see you every
day,&rdquo; promised Koto
extravagantly, for Komatsu Taro's
castle was quite a
distance off from Tokyo. Jack
Carruthers proffered his
escort to her whenever she wished to
visit them.</p><p>
  And Koto kept her word, and visited
her sister each day.
Always young Carruthers accompanied
her. Once in a while
Phil Evans also was with them, but
not very often. I
understood he had a good deal of
business to attend to in
Tokyo. I believe he had secured the
contract for an immense
electric railroad to be constructed.
Phil had stepped into
his father's shoes as president of an
immensely rich
American syndicate, controlling
railroads and mines all over
the world.</p><p>
  Koto and Jack always walked on
these trips to the castle.
They would arrive there&mdash;she
with her arms laden with
flowers, smiling and mischievous, for
I believe she teased
him constantly. He was either
desperately blue, or insanely
happy, according to how she had
treated him.<ref target="n17">[17]</ref></p><p>
  He was awfully in love with her. I
used to wonder how she
could resist the unspeakable glances
of his eyes. They were
so large and soft, the kind most
girls like, but she laughed
and chatted and coquetted with him,
till he didn't know
where he stood with her, whether he
had cause for hope or
despair. Although she had only just
reached her eighteenth
year, Koto, after a fashion, was a
finished coquette. It was
as natural to her as living.</p><p>
  One day he burst out and made her
listen to him, for I
believe she had cleverly held him off
from speaking.</p><p>
  They were standing right near me,
and I could see their
faces and hear all that passed. He
was white, and his lips
were dry&mdash;his eyes looked
unusually large, with dark shadows
under them, as though he had not
slept lately. I felt sorry
for him. She had her head held rather
proudly, and there was
the most provoking little smile
twinkling about her eyes and
dimpling her mouth.</p><p>
  &ldquo;You shall listen to me.
Koto, don't you know I love
you?&rdquo;</p><p>
  The words were spoken so quickly
and earnestly that the
drawl that somewhat spoiled his
speech was entirely absent.</p><p>
  She was not looking at him. Her
eyes were looking out of
the window, and feigned to be
intensely interested in
something she saw.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jack,&rdquo; she answered
him, &ldquo;just look at that sweet
little
red bird. Oo-h!&rdquo; This last as
he caught hold of her hands
and held them almost roughly.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Look at me, Koto!&rdquo; he
commanded.</p><p>
  She did so, and her eyes faltered
and fell. She ceased to
smile.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Koto, give me a little
hope.&rdquo;</p><p>
  Still she did not reply.</p><p>
  &ldquo;I have loved you ever since
I met you. You remember that
first day, don't you?&mdash;the deck
chairs were all tied
together and you were mad because you
had lost yours.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Yes, and you found it for
me.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;You were so glad when I
brought it over,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;It was awfully good of you,
Jack.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Koto, you will have
me&mdash;be my wife?&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;It would be nice, I think,
to get
married&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; she
began slowly.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Yes, yes, it would be, Koto.
We are both young, and I
have plenty. We could go wherever we
pleased&mdash;do whatever we
wanted, and&mdash;I love you
so.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;And I?&rdquo;&mdash;she drew
her hands from his&mdash;&ldquo;Jack,
I don't know
whether I love you. I'm not sure of
it. I&mdash;I think perhaps I
do, but&mdash;now supposing I'm
mistaken? That would be
dreadful!&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;No, no&mdash;don't suppose
that,&rdquo; he begged
eagerly.</p><p>
  &ldquo;But we must, Jack. Now I did
not suffer one bit when I
thought you were in love with Natsu.
Seems to me I really
was pleased, and if I had loved you,
I ought to have been
perfectly miserable.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Oh, you knew it didn't
amount to anything&mdash;only an
infatuation.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;It was a pretty serious
thing to poor little Natsu,&rdquo;
she
said coldly.</p><p>
  &ldquo;She seemed just a child,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;If she's a child, I must be
a baby, for I'm two years
younger,&rdquo; said Koto
girlishly.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Oh, but you look&mdash;you
seem so much older.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Oh, thank you, Mr.
Carruthers.&rdquo; This with a little
toss
of her head.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Now, don't get offended.
I&mdash;ah&mdash;am such a da&mdash;I
beg
pardon&mdash;I do&mdash;I really
do&mdash;but&mdash;Koto, don't lets
wander from
the question&mdash;the great
one&mdash;Will you have
me?&rdquo;</p><p>
  Koto considered a moment, her head
on one side. None of
her girl friends, that was sure, had
such a nice looking
sweetheart. She could go back amongst
them and exhibit him
with great pride. Still, she was
pretty sure of him and in
no hurry.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Well, I tell
you&mdash;I&mdash;think&mdash;I
will&mdash;but wait&rdquo;&mdash;as
he
tried to put his arm about her waist
joyously&mdash;&ldquo;I must get
Uncle Phil's consent
first.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Oh, he'll give it, of course
he will.&rdquo; Jack laughed
confidently. &ldquo;We may as well
consider it settled
now.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Well, you've got to wait
till he says yes,&rdquo; said Koto, a
trifle pettishly.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Let me measure the little
finger for the ring anyhow.&rdquo; He
slipped a string round it, laughing
joyously, and kissing
the finger while the girl stood
blushing, and looked as
though she was undecided how to feel,
whether to laugh with
him, for there is something
fascinating to a girl in an
engagement ring, or whether she was
going to cry, as she
half felt like doing.</p><p>
  She would not permit him to kiss
her even once, though he
begged so hard, and when she reached
the hotel, and ran off
to her room alone, she sat down and
looked at her third
little finger as girls do who have
just become engaged.</p><p>
  &ldquo;But&mdash;but,&rdquo; she
said to the pretty picture in the
glass,
&ldquo;I&mdash;I am not so sure. No,
I am not so sure.

<pb n="8"/>

I wonder what Uncle Phil will say.
I'll tell him to-morrow.
He'll have to quit teasing me about
'mooney eyes,' and all
that, like&mdash;like he speaks
of&mdash;of Jack. That's a common
name, but oh&mdash;I'm engaged to
him. No&mdash;Yes&mdash;No&mdash;I
am. It's
the same thing. Of course Uncle Phil
will say 'Yes.' I
almost wish he wouldn't. Yes I
do&mdash;because&mdash;I am not sure
of
myself after all.&rdquo;</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="11" id="d23">
<head>XI.</head>

  <p>&ldquo;Jack is so sure of Uncle
Phil's consenting. So am I, of
course. At the same time, I do want
to please him. I used to
be able to domineer over and twist
him round my little
finger, but of late, since he came to
Japan, I've noticed a
tendency on his part&mdash;well, at
times&mdash;to act with great
independence and authority, and
sometimes&mdash;even, to avoid
me. He tells me to do this or that in
a way I positively
can't disobey. Oh, dear, Uncle Phil's
changed some, that's
sure. He doesn't chat with me like he
used; he doesn't pet
me up. Oh, I wish I was a little girl
again, so I could
creep back into his heart again.
Nowadays I feel almost like
a stranger to him. He is good to me,
of course, but he keeps
me somehow at a distance from
him&mdash;and we used to be such
chums before I left America. He is
always looking at me,
too, and I never know whether he is
approving or
disapproving of me. I hope he likes
Jack. He has made fun of
us sometimes, though. I'll just have
to try my hand at
jollying him up before I tell him.
I'll get him in a good
humor, and then&mdash;why, I never
dreamed I<ref target="n18">[18]</ref> would need
any
courage to tell Uncle Phil anything.
And yet, somehow&mdash;his
eyes are so horribly keen, so
critical at times, and then
again so full of fun. And then he
looks so ridiculously
young, especially in his hunting and
bicycle clothes. I am
awfully proud of him. I declare I
wish I was really his
niece or his daughter. Dear me, I
couldn't be that&mdash;I'm much
too old. Uncle Phil's, let me see,
thirty-three years old.
That's pretty old. Ah! there he is
coming up the road. I'm
going to tell him this very
minute&mdash;if&mdash;if&mdash;I
can.&rdquo;</p><p>
  Now, I'm sure that none of you ever
gave the old
jinrikisha credit for being a mind
reader. But I am that,
nevertheless. That's how I knew just
what Mistress Koto was
troubling her pretty head
over.</p><p>
  Well, he, Phil Evans, came swinging
down the road, while
she was in the midst of this mental
soliloquy. She, artful
little minx, ran down the road to
meet him, and took his arm
in the most coaxing and loving way
imaginable. In fact, I
had never seen her so broadly loving
and familiar with him
before, barring, of course, when she
was a little child in
Japan and followed him round like his
shadow.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Oh, Uncle Phil,&rdquo; she
began, but he had quietly let his
own arm fall so that her little hand
had to drop from it
also.</p><p>
  There was a peculiar expression on
his face&mdash;hers was
hurt, and she looked as though she
were going to cry.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Come and sit over
here,&rdquo; he said quietly, drawing
a bench
under a large tree. &ldquo;Now, what
is it? You want something,
eh? Is that what all your palaver
means? He was talking
lightly.</p><p>
  His bantering words silenced the
girl for a moment, and
she sat on the bench, her eyes cast
down, her hands
nervously twisting her little
handkerchief into knots.</p><p>
  He was standing up, one foot on the
bench, and he was
looking at her keenly, in the
critical way that always made
the girl nervous and afraid of
him.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Well, little girl,&rdquo;
his voice was tender, gentle and
encouraging now.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Ja&mdash;Jack&mdash;Mr.
Carruthers&mdash;wants to marry
me.&rdquo;</p><p>
  It was out now, and she was
blushing furiously, though her
eyes were a trifle defiant, as though
she expected him to
ridicule, perhaps, laugh at
her.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Ah, indeed?&rdquo; He took a
cigar from his pocket,
deliberately cut the end off, and lit
it.</p><p>
  The hand that held it trembled ever
so slightly, in spite
of his apparent nonchalance.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and&mdash;I
thought I'd better ask you about
it,&rdquo; she
added shyly, still blushing.</p><p>
  &ldquo;You did!&rdquo;</p><p>
  His answers were so enigmatical, it
provoked the girl.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Yes, I did, and why don't
you say something?&rdquo; Again, the
defiant flash to the eyes.</p><p>
  &ldquo;What do you want me to
say?&rdquo; This, very coolly.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Why&mdash;why, I don't
know, I'm sure.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Are you in love with
him?&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Ye-
es&mdash;no&mdash;yes&mdash;that
is&mdash;I don't know, I'm
sure.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;H'm!&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;I&mdash;I think I
am.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;And you want my
consent?&rdquo; A touch of sarcasm
might have
been noticed here. It was strange,
but since he had returned
to Japan, these two seemed to be
always disagreeing with
each other, and a nameless, and I
thought cruel, antipathy
often seemed between them. It was the
man's fault.</p><p>
  The girl's color had died
out.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said slowly,
&ldquo;I&mdash;I thought I owed it to
you to
have your consent before I answered
him. I won't marry any
one you disapprove of&mdash;or you
don't want me to.&rdquo;</p><p>
  She was very meek now, apparently.
It made the man smile.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Well, then, I disapprove of
the Honorable Jack
Carruthers.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;What!&rdquo; She had sprung
breathlessly to her feet, all the
blood rosy red in her face, her eyes
flashing. &ldquo;You&mdash;&rdquo; It
was certain now that she had not
expected him to do
otherwise than consent. She was
indignant at his daring to
speak slightingly of her Jack.</p><p>
  &ldquo;What have you against
him?&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Oh, nothing in
particular,&rdquo; he answered
laconically,
shrugging his shoulders.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo; her
feeling choked her, &ldquo;I believe
you hate me,&rdquo;
she continued slowly, &ldquo;and want
to spite me for some reason-
-I believe you&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Oh no, don't say
that.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;But it must be true,
or&mdash;or&mdash;you would not be so
cruel&rdquo;&mdash;
the angry tears filled her eyes now,
and she was trembling.</p><p>
  Phil Evans threw the unsmoked cigar
away, and took a step
nearer to her. All the indifference,
the critical scrutiny
of the girl was gone now.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Shall I tell you why I will
not give my consent, not
merely to your having this Jack, but
to any one, in fact?&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Yes, tell me,&rdquo; and
then something in his face frightened
her, and she contradicted herself,
shrinking back from him.
&ldquo;No, no, don't tell
me.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Yes, I will. It's because I
want you for myself. Because
I love you&mdash;do you
understand?&rdquo;</p><p>
  He was white as death, and his face
was close to hers.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Oh, no, no, no, you don't
mean that! Oh, Uncle Phil, no,
no&mdash;think of
it&mdash;it&mdash;oh, oh,&mdash;you
love me! Don't look at me
like that. I&mdash;no, no&mdash;don't
touch me. Let me think&mdash;oh,
Uncle Phil, let me go,
ah!&rdquo;</p><p>
  She broke loose from him, and ran
like a beautiful,
frightened fawn, into Komatsu's
castle, and up to her own
little room, for she was spending the
day with them. There
she threw herself down on the little
couch, but she could
not think&mdash;could not compose her
wild thoughts. She tried to
call up some anger against the man,
but the anger was
thrilled with a delight she had never
known before. And
Jack? he held no place in her
thoughts. It was only&mdash;Uncle
Phil, Phil, Phil, dear, dear, dear
Phil. Just Phil&mdash;and she
kissed the little hands that he had
kissed, and went back
and forth to the mirror to see the
face he had kissed.
  Natsu knocked on the door, and
called to her.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Tha's a ledder for you,
Koto.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;A letter? What is that? Oh,
yes. Come in. Yes, give it to
me. Who is it from? Why, it's his
writing. Let me see.&rdquo;</p><p>
  She opened the envelope and read
slowly, the first time
not fully comprehending, and then
again to make sure that
she was not dreaming. Then she
dropped the letter and sat
down. It was quite short.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Forgive me, little
girl,&rdquo; it ran. &ldquo;I forgot
myself but
for a moment. It is all over now.
Yes, marry Jack. He is a
fine young fellow, and you have my
consent.&rdquo;</p><p>
  She picked the letter up, and read
it over again, and
smiled as she read and kissed and
cried over it a little
while. Her sister had left her alone.
She put her hat on her
head and ran down the stairs.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Natsu, I&mdash;I'm going to
the hotel. I have some business to
attend to.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Ah, yaes. Bud tha's too lade
goin' to thad hotel.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Oh, no, I feel so good
and&mdash;and nervous. It will do me
good&mdash;the walk.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;You certainly can't walk
it,&rdquo; put in Komatsu Taro,
&ldquo;and I
may not accompany you, as I have an
important meeting to
attend this evening. Moreover, all
the vehicles are in
use.&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;Let me ride in this
beautiful old one&mdash;our
grandfather's,&rdquo; said Koto,
daringly, speaking half at
random.</p><p>
   To her astonishment Komatsu agreed
to this, saying that I
was practically as strong as a new
vehicle, even if a trifle
heavy. And this was how I came to
witness their second
meeting.</p><p>
  They sent word to him that she was
waiting outside in the
jinrikisha to see him, that she had
not the time to come in.
And he came down to the gate of the
hotel garden where we
were waiting.</p><p>
  It was twilight, and the air was
sweet and balmy.</p><p>
  &ldquo;You have come all this way
so late?&rdquo; he asked her.</p><p>
  &ldquo;Yes, come, get into it, too.
There are two runners, and I
have something to tell you.&rdquo; He
obeyed her passively. As
soon as the runners started, she
commenced again.</p><p>
  &ldquo;What did you write that
letter for?&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;I did not wish to be the one
nightmare amidst your
happiness,&rdquo; he said in a low
voice.</p><p>
  She had lost all her shyness of the
afternoon.</p><p>
  &ldquo;And why&mdash;why would you
be a nightmare?&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;You confessed to your
love&mdash;for&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>
  &ldquo;No, did I? If I did so, I
mistook my own heart. I haven't
confessed to my love for any one yet.
I will now. Uncle
Philip&mdash;no, Phil,
will&mdash;will you take me in your
arms again,
and kiss me as you did this
afternoon?&rdquo;</p>

<p rend="center">* * *</p>

  <p>His sister Beryl and her husband
wrote them long letters
urging against the folly of their
marrying, because of the
girl's extreme youth. Even Komatsu
Taro urged them to wait a
while, but Natsu was wildly delighted
at it all, and her
little romantic soul was full.</p><p>
  &ldquo;I am going back to school
for one year,&rdquo; Koto told her,
&ldquo;I am eighteen now. He&mdash;he
wants me to go, and, oh, Natsu,
he will come to see me lots, and live
near me, and, it's to
please his sister, you know, but I
don't believe we'll
really be able to wait out the year,
will we?&rdquo; she turned to
Phil, blushing so beautifully.</p><p>
  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said,
catching his breath.</p>

     <p>Koto was an arrant coward.
That was why she shivered
and cried at the thought of having to
go to Jack and tell
him that she had been
mistaken&mdash;she did not care for
him,
could not, would not marry him. So
she put it to Natsu: &ldquo;How
can I tell him now, Natsu? You see I
as good as told him
that I'd have him. He is so assured
about it all now, and&mdash;
and, oh, I do hate to hurt any
one.&rdquo;</p><p>
     Natsu thought the question over
very seriously, sitting
at Koto's feet, her own little ones
drawn under her, looking
very quaint and pretty.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said,
finally, &ldquo;whad kin you do? You
jus'
gotter tell him. I onderstan' thad
you nod lig'. Me? I nod
lig' needer, bud whad kin we
do?&rdquo;</p><p>
     Koto didn't see any more than
Natsu that there was
anything for them to do but face it
out.</p><p>
     &ldquo;He'll feel dreadfully, I
know,&rdquo; she said,
moodily.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yaes&mdash;tha's true.
Sa-ay, don' you thing' I feelin'
thad dreadfully tarrible also, when
thad Omble Jag Cuthers
tellin' me he don' luf me. Whad you
thing? Well, sa-ay I
thing' thad Jag he gotter git over
thad tarrible pain and
mis-er-able-ness jus' lig' me&mdash;I
gittin' over. He bedder go
git nudder gell ter luf with, jus'
lig' me&mdash;I goin' git my
august hosban' to luf with me, tha's
same thing.&rdquo;</p><p>
     Koto laughed, a trifle provoked.
Natsu certainly was a
poor consoler.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Well, I suppose I'll have
to tell him,&rdquo; she admitted
with great distaste. &ldquo;He's
coming at four o'clock.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Sa-ay, I tellin' you
somethings.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Led me telling him
thad!&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Oh, Natsu, will
you?&rdquo;</p><p>
     Here was a way of escape Koto
had not thought of.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Oh, you darling, and
you'll tell him so gently and
kindly, won't you?&rdquo;</p><p>
     But Natsu would not be advised,
and informed Koto that
if she were to have charge of the
matter she preferred
conducting it her own way.</p><p>
     And so when Jack Carruthers came
for his answer he was
confronted in the zashishi (or guest
room) by Mrs. Komatsu
Taro, who welcomed him with the most
extravagant politeness.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Ah-h! How do do! Tha's
such nize days. How is your
health, augustness? Ah-h! Pray be
seated, excellency,
deigning to overlook the augustly
miserable seat.&rdquo;</p><p>
     Jack looked at her suspiciously.
She did not often
indulge in such voluble politeness;
moreover, he was nervous
and eager to see Koto.</p><p>
     He sat down, however, on a
little stool she placed for
him, his hat in his hands, looking
anything but comfortable
or good-tempered. Natsu sat down,
also, almost at his feet,
and clasped her little hands in her
lap.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Your health is
good?&rdquo; she repeated
assiduously.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; said
Jack, briefly.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Hah-h! Tha's nize! An'
also thad health of all your
honorable parents?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;They're all right, I
suppose,&rdquo; still more shortly
this
time.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Tha's nize also. An' your
frien's?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Oh, pshaw!&rdquo; He lost
patience, wondering savagely
whether she intended to ask after the
health of all his
individual friends and acquaintances.
Maybe after that she
would inquire solicitously after the
health of her august
majesty, the Queen of England, and so
on down the whole
royal family. Jack wished Koto would
come down.</p><p>
     &ldquo;I thing you lig'
something to dring' an' eat,
mebbe?&rdquo;
suggested Natsu, very
politely.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Er&mdash;what's that? Ah,
yes, very well.&rdquo; He threw his
hat
and gloves down on a small table, and
strode over resignedly
to a window, his hands deep in his
trousers pockets. He was
feeling nervous, and Koto's non-
appearance made him more so.</p><p>
     Natsu clapped her hands briskly,
and one of her maidens
came through the shoji.</p><p>
       &ldquo;Bring tea for the
honorable guest,&rdquo; said Natsu.
  Then she walked over to him.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Excellency,&rdquo; she
said, just a trifle timidly, &ldquo;I
lig'
speag' at you.&rdquo;</p><p>
     Jack turned about and faced her,
half good-naturedly,
half irritably. He was still sulking
over Koto's prolonged
absence, for had she not promised to
be in the zashishi at
four, and it was nearly five
now?</p><p>
       &ldquo;What is it,
Natsu?&mdash;er&mdash;something
important? If not-
  -ah, I say now&mdash;er&mdash;won't
you like a&mdash;er&mdash;good little
  girl run off and tell your sister
that I've been waiting
  an&mdash;ah&mdash;unconsciously
long time for her?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;My sister asking me to
mag' her egscuses
today.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>
     The maid had returned with the
tea, and Natsu was
pouring it slowly out into the tiny
cups.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Dring' this first and be
refreshed. Then I kin
egsplain.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Oh, damn the tea! Did
Koto tell you
to&mdash;ah&mdash;excuse
herself to me?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;If you kin nod be perlite
with me,&rdquo; quoth Natsu with
offended dignity, &ldquo;I nod
tellin' you aeverything. Then you
goin' away nod onerstanin'. Tha's
mos' hard ter suffer than
if you onerstan'.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Understand what?&rdquo;
He took the tea and feigned to drink
it to pacify her.</p><p>
     &ldquo;My seester nod luf with
you aeny longer,&rdquo; Natsu
informed him quietly.</p><p>
     The young man looked at her
steadily a moment, with
half puzzled, uncomprehending eyes.
The hand that held the
little cup, however, trembled. He put
it down.</p><p>
     &ldquo;What do you
mean?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;She tellin' me
thad.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;She&mdash;what do you
mean?&rdquo; he repeated
stupidly.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Jus' same thing you
tellin' me 'bout nod luf with me
account you luf
elsewhere.&rdquo;</p><p>
     I had never given Natsu credit
for any maliciousness in
her make-up. She had always seemed
too artless and innocent
for that. But it is the nature of the
Japanese women beneath
all their submissive sweetness, when
actually hurt, to
retaliate with all their might
whenever opportunity
presents; indeed, they will seek such
opportunity
relentlessly.</p><p>
     I hated to think that Natsu, the
gentle, loving, sweet
little girl I loved so well, could be
capable of absolute
cruelty in deliberately taking this
opportunity to retaliate
against Jack Carruthers for any pain
he may have caused her.</p><p>
     She sat before him on the mat
coolly sipping her sake,
and she told him all about Koto and
Philip Evans, her voice
very sweet and gentle, as she watched
the color fading from
his face and the young man biting his
quivering lips. Then
she added:</p><p>
       &ldquo;Tha's mos' sad thing I
aever have to tell. Tha'
  same thing with you&mdash;thad time
you tellin' me about nod
  lufing with me.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; The
exclamation was wrung from the young
man, and
was fraught with pain. Then he broke
down, and put his head
between his two hands.</p><p>
     &ldquo;My God! What can I
do?&rdquo;</p><p>
     I saw a white wave of fear and
contrition cross Natsu's
face. She had never seen a man, more
<orig reg="particularly">par-

<pb n="9"/>

ticularly</orig> a big strong man,
break down, and weep, yes,
actually seem to weep. No Japanese
man ever could do that.
She did not know what to do. Her
conscience was paining her
dreadfully now, and yet she knew if
she had not told him,
Koto would have had to.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Mister
Jag&mdash;Jag&mdash;Omble Jag
Cuthers,&rdquo; she said,
kneeling beside him; &ldquo;oh! all
the gods in the skies, forgive
me thad I mek you suffering
so.&rdquo;</p><p>
     The young man lifted his haggard
face from his hands,
and tried bravely to smile at
her.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Oh, don't, Natsu,&rdquo;
he said shakily, &ldquo;it wasn't
your
fault. I&mdash;I
understand.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Ah-h, yaes, alas, you
onderstan'. Tha's breagin' your
heart all daed.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Oh, I'm all right,&rdquo;
he pushed his fingers wearily
through his hair, &ldquo;I don't know
what else I expected,&rdquo; he
groaned and walked across the room
with a slow, uncertain
stride. Natsu trotted after him,
wringing her hands with
sympathy and distress.</p>

 <p rend="center">*    *    *</p>

     <p>&ldquo;Sa-ay, Omble
Jag&mdash;Mister
Jag&mdash;excellency&mdash;sa-ay I
goin' tell you something&mdash;lo,
I&mdash;I kin comfort with
you.&rdquo;</p><p>
     He smiled through his misery at
her concern.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Sa-ay&mdash;suppose you
gitting nudder nize beautifullest
ladies to luf with you. My
seester,&rdquo; she threw a
disparaging
note into her voice now, &ldquo;she
nod vaery nize&mdash;nod vaery&mdash;
jus' liddle bit. No&mdash;nod liddle
bit whicheven&mdash;mos' augustly
homely womans in all the whole worl'.
Now I egspeg some nize
beautifullest ladies goin' to lig'

No, don' shake your honorable heads,
you thing nod? Well me?
I thing' nod also thad times
you&mdash;whad is thad? Ah,
yaes&mdash;
jilting with me. Well me? I git my
august hosban to luf with
me jus' same way, an' lo, I am jus'
same habby also.&rdquo; She
ended triumphantly.</p><p>
     Jack picked his hat, stick and
gloves up, and held them
in one hand as he took Natsu's little
ones, which were both
outstretched in the other.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Good-bye,
Natsu&mdash;tell her that&mdash;that
you delivered her
message, and ah&mdash;I
said&mdash;&rdquo; he broke down
here, and went out
with the sentence unfinished.</p><p>
     Koto came through the shoji,
shivering. She flung
herself down on a couch and burst
into tears, sobbing
bitterly.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Oh, oh, I heard it all.
It was cruel. I&mdash;Natsu, how
could you do it?
How&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Thad is cruel,&rdquo;
said Natsu, gravely, &ldquo;bud whad
could I
do? You ask me to telling, an' I
telling. Tha's all.&rdquo; There
was a guilty tremor to her voice,
however.</p><p>
     &ldquo;But&mdash;but your
voice&mdash;you seemed cold and
unfeeling.&rdquo;</p><p>
     Natsu shrugged her
shoulders.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Tha's nod me he
luf,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>
     She poured out a delicious cup
of hot sake and gave it
to her sister, brushing the hair
tenderly back from the
somewhat fevered head, as she made
her drink it.</p><p>
       When Phil Evans finally
arrived he found the two
  girls sitting together in complete
silence. There were
  tear traces on both their
faces.</p><p>
     &ldquo;I met Jack in the
road,&rdquo; he said gravely.</p><p>
     He sat down close to Koto.
&ldquo;You told him?&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;No, I could not. Natsu
did so for me.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Natsu!&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;Yes, I hadn't the
courage.&rdquo;</p>

 <p rend="center">*    *    *</p>

     <p>Phil Evans made no comment,
and after a moment the girl
continued, her voice breaking,
&ldquo;Oh, Phil, I feel so
conscience-stricken and wicked about
it all. I almost wish I
had seen him myself, though it might
not have mended
matters.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Phil
slowly, &ldquo;it would not have
altered
things. I only wonder he did not
insist on seeing you.&rdquo;</p><p>
     &ldquo;He never was entirely
sure of me, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>
     After a moment she said,
&ldquo;Phil, dear, you&mdash;you
don't
think he will do anything
rash,&rdquo; with a girlish vivid
recollection of the sensational love
stories the girls had
indulged in at the school.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Oh, no, of course not.
He'll get over it. An
Englishman generally has plenty sand
and grit.&rdquo;</p><p>
     When Phil Evans returned to the
hotel that night some
lounger about the hotel told him that
Jack Carruthers had
left only a few hours before for
Nagasaki, from whence he
proposed sailing for England.</p><p>
     And that is the last I heard of
the Honorable Jack
Carruthers.</p>

</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="13" id="d26">
<head>XIII. L'Envoi.</head>

     <p>And now I have told you all
there is to tell of those
dear ones, whom I have loved in my
day. Maybe when I started
out to prattle and gossip of the
fleeting memories of the
past, I intended to tell you of
others besides those who
came nearest to my own heart, but
like most old people my
mind will run constantly to those I
love most, and whose
lives I have played a larger part in.
Others have come and
gone before me&mdash;many a love
story, tragedy and comedy, of
one chapter only, have I been the
silent witness of, among
those who flashed but once into my
life and then passed out.
Of the ones I have told you, I picked
up the threads of
their careers and because they were
dear to my heart, how
could I forget them?</p><p>
     I am old, so very, very old now,
and slowly but surely
I am going to pieces. You see, my
master overrated my
strength and that ride Koto took in
me all the way to Tokyo
and back with her lover, practically
ruined my health for
the rest of my days. There is nought
in my life to-day that
I can cry out against. The gods have
seen fit to indeed
bestow all good blessings on me in my
old age. I am
surrounded by those I love most on
earth. I serve the
descendents of my beloved master of
the past. Furthermore, I
know that when my bones (pardon an
old jinrikisha's conceit
in referring to his parts thuswise)
shall fall apart, they
will not be vulgarly scattered, but
gathered together with
great reverence and care, for am I
not beloved by my dear
master and his gentle wife? They
always hold that I am
partially responsible for their
happiness, as it was through
me they first met.</p>

<p rend="center">*    *    *</p>

     <p>They are very happy, these
two. The gods have smiled on
them also, and blessed them with a
truly wonderful man-
child. This is the greatest of the
gods' gifts&mdash;a little
child. The child bears an odd name,
that is, odd for a
Japanese child. &ldquo;Philip&rdquo;
is its first name, after its new
uncle. The child in no way looks
American; when it shall
grow to years of understanding it
will question the
honorable meaning of its name, as all
Japanese children do,
and its parents will answer,
&ldquo;The name means all that is
good and true,&rdquo; for so are they
pleased to regard their
august brother-in-law.</p><p>
     The child pleases me much, and I
fain<ref target="n19">[19]</ref>
would talk of
him also, but I am feeble and
tired&mdash;tired of talking of
others. Mayhap had I spoken only of
myself there would have
been no ending to this, for what
subject can be found to
interest oneself more than that of
oneself?</p><p>
     And now, methinks, I am
launching out and talking
somewhat unnecessarily; whereas I
promised in the beginning
not to dwell on myself, and so I pray
your august pardons,
and offer no apology save that of my
extreme old age.</p><p>
     My beloved master has entered
the room now. He is
standing by my side, resting one hand
tenderly on my calash-
top. He notes that I am weary, and in
spite of all the outer
dressing and finery he has been
pleased to bestow on me, I
am surely losing my strength and
health. My heart is,
however, warmed with the gentleness
and tenderness of his
glance and the touch of his
hands.</p><p>
     &ldquo;Poor old
jinrikisha,&rdquo; he is saying to
his little wife,
who has come in also, &ldquo;see how
shaky it is getting. Alas, I
am afraid we can no longer repair it.
This is lamentable,
for I have indeed learned to love it. I know not why, save
perhaps that it brought me you, ane-
san. There always was
something warm and good and inviting
about it, moreover. The
old thing looks as if it had a
soul.&rdquo;</p>
