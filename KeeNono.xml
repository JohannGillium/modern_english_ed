<head>INTRODUCTION</head>
<p>
<hi rend="italic">The Shrine in the Fields</hi>, a play of the third
category, has traditionally been ascribed to Zeami, but in recent years
some scholars have expressed doubts about this attribution, largely for
technical reasons of style. It is hard, however, to imagine who else but
Zeami could have written so hauntingly evocative a work. Perhaps he wrote
it in the last years of his life, a period not covered by the critical
writings that are the firmest evidence for attribution; or perhaps, as
Professor Konishi Jin'ichi has suggested, Zeami's second son, Motoyoshi,
who is not credited with any plays in the repertory, may have written <hi rend="italic">The Shrine in the Fields</hi>,
<hi rend="italic">Yuya</hi>, and various other masterpieces whose authorship
is uncertain.
</p>

<p>
The play recalls the love affair between Prince Genji and Lady
Rokuj&omacr;, here called by her title, Miyasudokoro. Readers of <hi rend="italic">The Tale of Genji</hi> will remember Rokuj&omacr; mainly as
the proud and elegant woman whose jealousy led to the death of Genji's
wife, Aoi; this story is treated in the play <hi rend="italic">Aoi no
Ue</hi>, translated by Arthur Waley in <hi rend="italic">The N&omacr;
Plays of Japan</hi>. In <hi rend="italic">The Shrine in the Fields</hi>,
however, Rokuj&omacr; is treated with the utmost sympathy, and


<pb n="181"/>
nothing suggests that her living ghost killed Aoi. The scenes from <hi rend="italic">The Tale of Genji</hi> which provided material for the play
include: Genji's visit to Rokuj&omacr;; the humiliation of Rokuj&omacr;
when Aoi's carriage forced back her own at the Kamo Festival; and the
visit to Nonomiya, the Shrine in the Fields, by Genji, when Rokuj&omacr;'s
daughter, the new Virgin of the Ise Shrine, was in residence there.
</p>

<p>
The Emperor was always represented at Ise by a virgin of imperial blood.
When a new virgin was appointed, before going to Ise she would reside for
a considerable period just outside Kyoto at Nonomiya. (The word <hi rend="italic">miya</hi>
primarily means a shrine, but can also mean a
palace.) Nonomiya was intimately associated with Ise, the chief shrine of
the Sun Goddess. It served its main function only intermittently, however,
and was therefore built like a temporary shrine with a <hi rend="italic">torii</hi> of logs.
</p>

<p>
The season is the end of autumn and an air of melancholy and impermanence
dominates the play.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="italic">The Shrine in the Fields</hi> is performed by all
schools of N&omacr;.

<p>
I am an itinerant priest. Recently I have been staying in the Capital,
where I have visited all the famous sites and relics of the past. Autumn
is nearing its close and Sagano will be lovely now. I think I shall go
there for a visit.

<stage>
He turns towards the torii, indicating that he has already arrived in
Sagano.
</stage>

When I asked people about this wood they told me it is the ancient site of
the Shrine in the Fields. I would like to visit the place, though I am no
more than a passing stranger.

He advances to stage center, still facing the torii.)

designated as the Priestess of Ise was temporarily lodged. The custom has
fallen into disuse, but today, the seventh day of the ninth month, is
still a time for recalling the past. Each year, unknown to anyone else, I
come to sweep the shrine and to perform a service. I do not know where you
have come from, but your presence here is an intrusion. Please leave at

This is the day when Genji the Shining One visited this place, the seventh
day of the ninth month. He brought with him a twig of <hi rend="italic">sakaki</hi> and pushed it through the sacred fence.
Miyasudokoro at once composed the poem:

<head>Notes</head>

<note id="n184.1"><seg type="note-symbol">1.</seg><p> The passage above hints at the fading love of Genji for Miyasudokoro.
</p></note>

<note id="n184.2"><seg type="note-symbol">2.</seg> <p> The verb <hi rend="italic">shinobu</hi>, "to recall the past,"
leads into the noun <hi rend="italic">shinobu no kusagoromo</hi>, a
robe made of a kind of printed cloth, the design pressed from leaves. This
cloth is mentioned effectively in <hi rend="italic">The Brocade
Tree</hi>, but here it seems an extraneous ornament and is hence omitted
from the translation.
</p></note>

<note id="n185.3"><seg type="note-symbol">3.</seg> <p> The poem is quoted from The <hi rend="italic">Tale of Genji</hi>,
where it seems to mean that the visitor has come without invitation,
pretending he had been invited. The poem is an allusive variation on poem
no. 982 of the Kokinsh&umacr;: "My hut is at the foot of Mount Miwa. If
you love me come and visit me; my gate is the one with the cedar by it."
</p></note>

<note id="n186.4"><seg type="note-symbol">4. </seg> <p>Commentators disagree on the nature of the hut, some taking it as the
place where the guardian lives, others as a place where sacred food is
prepared. The meaning in either case is that buildings which, like
everything else at the Shrine in the Fields, seemed highly perishable have
miraculously survived.
</p></note>

<note id="n186.5"><seg type="note-symbol">5.</seg> <p> Kiritsubo was Genji's mother.
</p></note>

<note id="n187.6"><seg type="note-symbol">6.</seg> <p> Streamers of paper or mulberry bark were inscribed with prayers and
attached to <hi rend="italic">sakaki</hi> branches, then tossed into
the stream.
</p></note>

<note id="n187.7"><seg type="note-symbol">7.</seg> <p> There are allusions here to the famous poem by Ono no Komachi in which
she compares herself to a floating waterweed. See <hi
rend="italic">Komachi at Sekidera</hi>.
</p></note>

<note id="n187.8"><seg type="note-symbol">8.</seg> <p> A slightly modified version of the poem Miyasudokoro sent to Genji at
Nonomiya. Being wetted by the waves has the additional meaning of having
her sleeves wetted by tears. In other words, she is sure nobody will care
whether she weeps with sorrow or not.
</p></note>

<note id="n187.9"><seg type="note-symbol">9.</seg> <p> The Virgin resided at Ise in the Tak&eacute; Palace.
</p></note>

<note id="n188.10"><seg type="note-symbol">10.</seg> <p> A priest's robe was frequently called <hi rend="italic">kokegoromo</hi>, literally "moss robe." Here it has that
meaning, but also refers to the moss on the ground. Because it is autumn
the grass too is faded like the priest's robe.
</p></note>

<note id="n191.11"><seg type="note-symbol">11.</seg> <p> The Burning House is a familiar image for this world, which an
enlightened person should flee as eagerly as from a burning house.
