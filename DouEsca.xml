                      MY ESCAPE FROM SLAVERY<lb/>
</head>
<p>IN the first narrative of my experience in slavery, written
nearly forty years ago, and in various writings since, I have given
the public what I considered very good reasons for withholding the
manner of my escape.  In substance these reasons were, first, that
such publication at any time during the existence of slavery might
be used by the master against the slave, and prevent the future
escape of any who might adopt the same means that I did.  The
second reason was, if possible, still more binding to silence: the
publication of details would certainly have put in peril the
persons and property of those who assisted.  Murder itself was not
more sternly and certainly punished in the State of Maryland than
that of aiding and abetting the escape of a slave.  Many colored
men, for no other crime than that of giving aid to a fugitive
slave, have, like Charles T. Torrey, perished in prison.  The
abolition of slavery in my native State and throughout the country,
<pb n="126"/>
and the lapse of time, render the caution hitherto
observed no longer necessary.  But even since the abolition of
slavery, I have sometimes thought it well enough to baffle
curiosity by saying that while slavery existed there were good
reasons for not telling the manner of my escape, and since slavery
had ceased to exist, there was no reason for telling it.  I shall
now, however, cease to avail myself of this formula, and, as far as
I can, endeavor to satisfy this very natural curiosity.  I should,
perhaps, have yielded to that feeling sooner, had there been
anything very heroic or thrilling in the incidents connected with
my escape, for I am sorry to say I have nothing of that sort to
tell; and yet the courage that could risk betrayal and the bravery
which was ready to encounter death, if need be, in pursuit of
freedom, were essential features in the undertaking.  My success
was due to address rather than courage, to good luck rather than
bravery.  My means of escape were provided for me by the very men
who were making laws to hold and bind me more securely in slavery.
</p><p>It was the custom in the State of Maryland to require the free
colored people to have what were called free papers.  These
instruments they were required to renew very often, and by charging
a fee for this writing, considerable sums from time to time were
collected by the State.  In these papers the name, age, color,
height, and form of the freeman were described, together with any
scars or other marks upon his person which could assist in his
identification.  This device in some measure defeated itself &mdash; since
more than one man could be found to answer the same general
description.  Hence many slaves could escape by personating the
owner of one set of papers; and this was often done as follows: A
slave, nearly or sufficiently answering the description set forth
in the papers, would borrow or hire them till by means of them he
could escape to a free State, and then, by mail or otherwise, would
return them to the owner.  The operation was a hazardous one for
the lender as well as for the borrower.  A failure on the part of
the fugitive to send back the papers would imperil his benefactor,
and the discovery of the papers in possession of the wrong man
would imperil both the fugitive and his friend.  It was, therefore,
an act of supreme trust on the part of a freeman of color thus to
put in jeopardy his own liberty that another might be free.  It
was, however, not unfrequently bravely done, and was seldom
discovered.  I was not so fortunate as to resemble any of my free
acquaintances sufficiently to answer the description of their
papers.  But I had a friend &mdash; a sailor &mdash; who owned a sailor's
protection, which answered somewhat the purpose of free papers &mdash;
describing his person, and certifying to the fact that he was a
free American sailor.  The instrument had at its head the American
eagle, which gave it the appearance at once of an authorized
document.  This protection, when in my hands, did not describe its
bearer very accurately.  Indeed, it called for a man much darker
than myself, and close examination of it would have caused my
arrest at the start.
</p><p>In order to avoid this fatal scrutiny on the part of railroad
officials, I arranged with Isaac Rolls, a Baltimore hackman, to
bring my baggage to the Philadelphia train just on the moment of
starting, and jumped upon the car myself when the train was in
motion.  Had I gone into the station and offered to purchase a
ticket, I should have been instantly and carefully examined, and
undoubtedly arrested.  In choosing this plan I considered the
jostle of the train, and the natural haste of the conductor, in a
train crowded with passengers, and relied upon my skill and address
in playing the sailor, as described in my protection, to do the
rest.  One element in my favor was the kind feeling which prevailed
in Baltimore and other sea-ports at the time, toward "those who go
down to the sea in ships."  "Free trade and sailors' rights" just
then expressed the sentiment of the country.  In my clothing I was
rigged out in sailor style.  I had on a red shirt and a tarpaulin
hat, and a black cravat tied in sailor fashion carelessly and
loosely about my neck.  My knowledge of ships and sailor's talk
came much to my assistance, for I knew a ship from stem to stern,
and from keelson to cross-trees, and could talk sailor like an "old
salt."  I was well on the way to Havre de Grace before the
conductor came into the negro car to collect tickets and examine
the papers of his black passengers.  This was a critical moment in
the drama.  My whole future depended upon the decision of this
conductor.  Agitated though I was while this ceremony was
proceeding, still, externally, at least, I was apparently calm and
self-possessed.  He went on with his duty &mdash; examining several
colored passengers before reaching me.  He was somewhat harsh in
tone and peremptory in manner until he reached me, when, strange
enough, and to my surprise and relief, his whole manner changed.
Seeing that I did not readily produce my free papers, as the other
colored persons in the car had done, he said to me, in friendly
contrast with his bearing toward the others:
</p><p>"I suppose you have your free papers?"
</p><p>To which I answered:
</p><p>"No sir; I never carry my free papers to sea with me."
<pb n="127"/>
</p><p>"But you have something to show that you are a freeman,
haven't you?"
</p><p>"Yes, sir," I answered; "I have a paper with the American
Eagle on it, and that will carry me around the world."
</p><p>With this I drew from my deep sailor's pocket my seaman's
protection, as before described.  The merest glance at the paper
satisfied him, and he took my fare and went on about his business.
This moment of time was one of the most anxious I ever experienced.
Had the conductor looked closely at the paper, he could not have
failed to discover that it called for a very different-looking
person from myself, and in that case it would have been his duty to
arrest me on the instant, and send me back to Baltimore from the
first station.  When he left me with the assurance that I was all
right, though much relieved, I realized that I was still in great
danger: I was still in Maryland, and subject to arrest at any
moment.  I saw on the train several persons who would have known me
in any other clothes, and I feared they might recognize me, even in
my sailor "rig," and report me to the conductor, who would then
subject me to a closer examination, which I knew well would be
fatal to me.
</p><p>Though I was not a murderer fleeing from justice, I felt
perhaps quite as miserable as such a criminal.  The train was
moving at a very high rate of speed for that epoch of railroad
travel, but to my anxious mind it was moving far too slowly.
Minutes were hours, and hours were days during this part of my
flight.  After Maryland, I was to pass through Delaware &mdash; another
slave State, where slave-catchers generally awaited their prey, for
it was not in the interior of the State, but on its borders, that
these human hounds were most vigilant and active.  The border lines
between slavery and freedom were the dangerous ones for the
fugitives.  The heart of no fox or deer, with hungry hounds on his
trail in full chase, could have beaten more anxiously or noisily
than did mine from the time I left Baltimore till I reached
Philadelphia.  The passage of the Susquehanna River at Havre de
Grace was at that time made by ferry-boat, on board of which I met
a young colored man by the name of Nichols, who came very near
betraying me.  He was a "hand" on the boat, but, instead of minding
his business, he insisted upon knowing me, and asking me dangerous
questions as to where I was going, when I was coming back, etc.  I
got away from my old and inconvenient acquaintance as soon as I
could decently do so, and went to another part of the boat.  Once
across the river, I encountered a new danger.  Only a few days
before, I had been at work on a revenue cutter, in Mr. Price's
ship-yard in Baltimore, under the care of Captain McGowan.  On the
meeting at this point of the two trains, the one going south
stopped on the track just opposite to the one going north, and it
so happened that this Captain McGowan sat at a window where he
could see me very distinctly, and would certainly have recognized
me had he looked at me but for a second.  Fortunately, in the hurry
of the moment, he did not see me; and the trains soon passed each
other on their respective ways.  But this was not my only hair-breadth escape.  A German blacksmith whom I knew well was on the
train with me, and looked at me very intently, as if he thought he
had seen me somewhere before in his travels.  I really believe he
knew me, but had no heart to betray me.  At any rate, he saw me
escaping and held his peace.
</p><p>The last point of imminent danger, and the one I dreaded most,
was Wilmington.  Here we left the train and took the steam-boat for
Philadelphia.  In making the change here I again apprehended
arrest, but no one disturbed me, and I was soon on the broad and
beautiful Delaware, speeding away to the Quaker City.  On reaching
Philadelphia in the afternoon, I inquired of a colored man how I
could get on to New York.  He directed me to the William-street
depot, and thither I went, taking the train that night.  I reached
New York Tuesday morning, having completed the journey in less than
twenty-four hours.
</p><p>My free life began on the third of September, 1838.  On the
morning of the fourth of that month, after an anxious and most
perilous but safe journey, I found myself in the big city of New
York, a <hi rend="italic">free man</hi> &mdash; one more added to the mighty throng which,
like the confused waves of the troubled sea, surged to and fro
between the lofty walls of Broadway.  Though dazzled with the
wonders which met me on every hand, my thoughts could not be much
withdrawn from my strange situation.  For the moment, the dreams of
my youth and the hopes of my manhood were completely fulfilled.
The bonds that had held me to "old master" were broken.  No man now
had a right to call me his slave or assert mastery over me.  I was
in the rough and tumble of an outdoor world, to take my chance with
the rest of its busy number.  I have often been asked how I felt
when first I found myself on free soil.  There is scarcely anything
in my experience about which I could not give a more satisfactory
answer.  A new world had opened upon me.  If life is more than
breath and the "quick round of blood," I lived more in that one day
than
<pb n="128"/>
in a year of my slave life.  It was a time of joyous
excitement which words can but tamely describe.  In a letter
written to a friend soon after reaching New York, I said: "I felt
as one might feel upon escape from a den of hungry lions."  Anguish
and grief, like darkness and rain, may be depicted; but gladness
and joy, like the rainbow, defy the skill of pen or pencil.  During
ten or fifteen years I had been, as it were, dragging a heavy chain
which no strength of mine could break; I was not only a slave, but
a slave for life.  I might become a husband, a father, an aged man,
but through all, from birth to death, from the cradle to the grave,
I had felt myself doomed.  All efforts I had previously made to
secure my freedom had not only failed, but had seemed only to rivet
my fetters the more firmly, and to render my escape more difficult.
Baffled, entangled, and discouraged, I had at times asked myself
the question, May not my condition after all be God's work, and
ordered for a wise purpose, and if so, Is not submission my duty?
A contest had in fact been going on in my mind for a long time,
between the clear consciousness of right and the plausible make-shifts of theology and superstition.  The one held me an abject
slave &mdash; a prisoner for life, punished for some transgression in
which I had no lot nor part; and the other counseled me to manly
endeavor to secure my freedom.  This contest was now ended; my
chains were broken, and the victory brought me unspeakable joy.
</p><p>But my gladness was short-lived, for I was not yet out of the
reach and power of the slave-holders.  I soon found that New York
was not quite so free or so safe a refuge as I had supposed, and a
sense of loneliness and insecurity again oppressed me most sadly.
I chanced to meet on the street, a few hours after my landing, a
fugitive slave whom I had once known well in slavery.  The
information received from him alarmed me.  The fugitive in question
was known in Baltimore as "Allender's Jake," but in New York he
wore the more respectable name of "William Dixon."  Jake, in law,
was the property of Doctor Allender, and Tolly Allender, the son of
the doctor, had once made an effort to recapture <hi rend="italic">Mr. Dixon</hi>, but
had failed for want of evidence to support his claim.  Jake told me
the circumstances of this attempt, and how narrowly he escaped
being sent back to slavery and torture.  He told me that New York
was then full of Southerners returning from the Northern watering-places; that the colored people of New York were not to be trusted;
that there were hired men of my own color who would betray me for
a few dollars; that there were hired men ever on the lookout for
fugitives; that I must trust no man with my secret; that I must not
think of going either upon the wharves or into any colored
boarding-house, for all such places were closely watched; that he
was himself unable to help me; and, in fact, he seemed while
speaking to me to fear lest I myself might be a spy and a betrayer.
Under this apprehension, as I suppose, he showed signs of wishing
to be rid of me, and with whitewash brush in hand, in search of
work, he soon disappeared.
</p><p>This picture, given by poor "Jake," of New York, was a damper
to my enthusiasm.  My little store of money would soon be
exhausted, and since it would be unsafe for me to go on the wharves
for work, and I had no introductions elsewhere, the prospect for me
was far from cheerful.  I saw the wisdom of keeping away from the
ship-yards, for, if pursued, as I felt certain I should be, Mr.
Auld, my "master," would naturally seek me there among the calkers.
Every door seemed closed against me.  I was in the midst of an
ocean of my fellow-men, and yet a perfect stranger to every one.
I was without home, without acquaintance, without money, without
credit, without work, and without any definite knowledge as to what
course to take, or where to look for succor.  In such an extremity,
a man had something besides his new-born freedom to think of.
While wandering about the streets of New York, and lodging at least
one night among the barrels on one of the wharves, I was indeed
free &mdash; from slavery, but free from food and shelter as well.  I kept
my secret to myself as long as I could, but I was compelled at last
to seek some one who would befriend me without taking advantage of
my destitution to betray me.  Such a person I found in a sailor
named Stuart, a warm-hearted and generous fellow, who, from his
humble home on Centre street, saw me standing on the opposite
sidewalk, near the Tombs prison.  As he approached me, I ventured
a remark to him which at once enlisted his interest in me.  He took
me to his home to spend the night, and in the morning went with me
to Mr. David Ruggles, the secretary of the New York Vigilance
Committee, a co-worker with Isaac T. Hopper, Lewis and Arthur
Tappan, Theodore S. Wright, Samuel Cornish, Thomas Downing, Philip
A. Bell, and other true men of their time.  All these (save Mr.
Bell, who still lives, and is editor and publisher of a paper
called the "Elevator," in San Francisco) have finished their work
on earth.  Once in the hands of these brave and wise men, I felt
comparatively safe.  With Mr. Ruggles, on the corner
<pb n="129"/>
of Lispenard and Church streets, I was hidden several days, during
which time my intended wife came on from Baltimore at my call, to
share the burdens of life with me.  She was a free woman, and came
at once on getting the good news of my safety.  We were married by
Rev. J. W. C. Pennington, then a well-known and respected
Presbyterian minister.  I had no money with which to pay the
marriage fee, but he seemed well pleased with our thanks.
</p><p>Mr. Ruggles was the first officer on the "Underground
Railroad" whom I met after coming North, and was, indeed, the only
one with whom I had anything to do till I became such an officer
myself.  Learning that my trade was that of a calker, he promptly
decided that the best place for me was in New Bedford, Mass.  He
told me that many ships for whaling voyages were fitted out there,
and that I might there find work at my trade and make a good
living.  So, on the day of the marriage ceremony, we took our
little luggage to the steamer <hi rend="italic">John W. Richmond</hi>, which, at that
time, was one of the line running between New York and Newport, R.
I.  Forty-three years ago colored travelers were not permitted in
the cabin, nor allowed abaft the paddle-wheels of a steam vessel.
They were compelled, whatever the weather might be, &mdash; whether cold
or hot, wet or dry, &mdash; to spend the night on deck.  Unjust as this
regulation was, it did not trouble us much; we had fared much
harder before.  We arrived at Newport the next morning, and soon
after an old fashioned stage-coach, with "New Bedford" in large
yellow letters on its sides, came down to the wharf.  I had not
money enough to pay our fare, and stood hesitating what to do.
Fortunately for us, there were two Quaker gentlemen who were about
to take passage on the stage, &mdash; Friends William C. Taber and Joseph
Ricketson, &mdash; who at once discerned our true situation, and, in a
peculiarly quiet way, addressing me, Mr. Taber said: "Thee get in."
I never obeyed an order with more alacrity, and we were soon on our
way to our new home.  When we reached "Stone Bridge" the passengers
alighted for breakfast, and paid their fares to the driver.  We
took no breakfast, and, when asked for our fares, I told the driver
I would make it right with him when we reached New Bedford.  I
expected some objection to this on his part, but he made none.
When, however, we reached New Bedford, he took our baggage,
including three music-books, &mdash; two of them collections by Dyer, and
one by Shaw, &mdash; and held them until I was able to redeem them by
paying to him the amount due for our rides.  This was soon done,
for Mr. Nathan Johnson not only received me kindly and hospitably,
but, on being informed about our baggage, at once loaned me the two
dollars with which to square accounts with the stage-driver.  Mr.
and Mrs. Nathan Johnson reached a good old age, and now rest from
their labors.  I am under many grateful obligations to them.  They
not only "took me in when a stranger" and "fed me when hungry," but
taught me how to make an honest living.  Thus, in a fortnight after
my flight from Maryland, I was safe in New Bedford, a citizen of
the grand old commonwealth of Massachusetts.
</p><p>Once initiated into my new life of freedom and assured by Mr.
Johnson that I need not fear recapture in that city, a
comparatively unimportant question arose as to the name by which I
should be known thereafter in my new relation as a free man.  The
name given me by my dear mother was no less pretentious and long
than Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey.  I had, however, while
living in Maryland, dispensed with the Augustus Washington, and
retained only Frederick Bailey.  Between Baltimore and New Bedford,
the better to conceal myself from the slave-hunters, I had parted
with Bailey and called myself Johnson; but in New Bedford I found
that the Johnson family was already so numerous as to cause some
confusion in distinguishing them, hence a change in this name
seemed desirable.  Nathan Johnson, mine host, placed great emphasis
upon this necessity, and wished me to allow him to select a name
for me.  I consented, and he called me by my present name &mdash; the one
by which I have been known for three and forty years &mdash; Frederick
Douglass.  Mr. Johnson had just been reading the "Lady of the
Lake," and so pleased was he with its great character that he
wished me to bear his name.  Since reading that charming poem
myself, I have often thought that, considering the noble
hospitality and manly character of Nathan Johnson &mdash; black man though
he was &mdash; he, far more than I, illustrated the virtues of the Douglas
of Scotland.  Sure am I that, if any slave-catcher had entered his
domicile with a view to my recapture, Johnson would have shown
himself like him of the "stalwart hand."
</p><p>The reader may be surprised at the impressions I had in some
way conceived of the social and material condition of the people at
the North.  I had no proper idea of the wealth, refinement,
enterprise, and high civilization of this section of the country.
My "Columbian Orator," almost my only book, had done nothing to
enlighten me concerning Northern society.  I had been taught that
slavery was the bottom fact of all wealth.  With this foundation
idea, I came naturally to the conclusion
<pb n="130"/>
that poverty must
be the general condition of the people of the free States.  In the
country from which I came, a white man holding no slaves was
usually an ignorant and poverty-stricken man, and men of this class
were contemptuously called "poor white trash."  Hence I supposed
that, since the non-slave-holders at the South were ignorant, poor,
and degraded as a class, the non-slave-holders at the North must be
in a similar condition.  I could have landed in no part of the
United States where I should have found a more striking and
gratifying contrast, not only to life generally in the South, but
in the condition of the colored people there, than in New Bedford.
I was amazed when Mr. Johnson told me that there was nothing in the
laws or constitution of Massachusetts that would prevent a colored
man from being governor of the State, if the people should see fit
to elect him.  There, too, the black man's children attended the
public schools with the white man's children, and apparently
without objection from any quarter.  To impress me with my security
from recapture and return to slavery, Mr. Johnson assured me that
no slave-holder could take a slave out of New Bedford; that there
were men there who would lay down their lives to save me from such
a fate.
</p><p>The fifth day after my arrival, I put on the clothes of a
common laborer, and went upon the wharves in search of work.  On my
way down Union street I saw a large pile of coal in front of the
house of Rev. Ephraim Peabody, the Unitarian minister.  I went to
the kitchen door and asked the privilege of bringing in and putting
away this coal.  "What will you charge?" said the lady.  "I will
leave that to you, madam."  "You may put it away," she said.  I was
not long in accomplishing the job, when the dear lady put into my
hand <hi rend="italic">two silver half-dollars</hi>.  To understand the emotion which
swelled my heart as I clasped this money, realizing that I had no
master who could take it from me, &mdash; <hi rend="italic">that it was mine &mdash; that my
hands were my own</hi>, and could earn more of the precious coin, &mdash; one
must have been in some sense himself a slave.  My next job was
stowing a sloop at Uncle Gid. Howland's wharf with a cargo of oil
for New York.  I was not only a freeman, but a free working-man,
and no "master" stood ready at the end of the week to seize my hard
earnings.
</p><p>The season was growing late and work was plenty.  Ships were
being fitted out for whaling, and much wood was used in storing
them.  The sawing this wood was considered a good job.  With the
help of old Friend Johnson (blessings on his memory) I got a saw
and "buck," and went at it.  When I went into a store to buy a cord
with which to brace up my saw in the frame, I asked for a "fip's"
worth of cord.  The man behind the counter looked rather sharply at
me, and said with equal sharpness, "You don't belong about here."
I was alarmed, and thought I had betrayed myself.  A fip in
Maryland was six and a quarter cents, called fourpence in
Massachusetts.  But no harm came from the "fi'penny-bit" blunder,
and I confidently and cheerfully went to work with my saw and buck.
It was new business to me, but I never did better work, or more of
it, in the same space of time on the plantation for Covey, the
negro-breaker, than I did for myself in these earliest years of my
freedom.
</p><p>Notwithstanding the just and humane sentiment of New Bedford
three and forty years ago, the place was not entirely free from
race and color prejudice.  The good influence of the Roaches,
Rodmans, Arnolds, Grinnells, and Robesons did not pervade all
classes of its people.  The test of the real civilization of the
community came when I applied for work at my trade, and then my
repulse was emphatic and decisive.  It so happened that Mr. Rodney
French, a wealthy and enterprising citizen, distinguished as an
anti-slavery man, was fitting out a vessel for a whaling voyage,
upon which there was a heavy job of calking and coppering to be
done.  I had some skill in both branches, and applied to Mr. French
for work.  He, generous man that he was, told me he would employ
me, and I might go at once to the vessel.  I obeyed him, but upon
reaching the float-stage, where others [sic] calkers were at work,
I was told that every white man would leave the ship, in her
unfinished condition, if I struck a blow at my trade upon her.
This uncivil, inhuman, and selfish treatment was not so shocking
and scandalous in my eyes at the time as it now appears to me.
Slavery had inured me to hardships that made ordinary trouble sit
lightly upon me.  Could I have worked at my trade I could have
earned two dollars a day, but as a common laborer I received but
one dollar.  The difference was of great importance to me, but if
I could not get two dollars, I was glad to get one; and so I went
to work for Mr. French as a common laborer.  The consciousness that
I was free &mdash; no longer a slave &mdash; kept me cheerful under this, and
many similar proscriptions, which I was destined to meet in New
Bedford and elsewhere on the free soil of Massachusetts.  For
instance, though colored children attended the schools, and were
treated kindly by their
<pb n="131"/>
teachers, the New Bedford Lyceum
refused, till several years after my residence in that city, to
allow any colored person to attend the lectures delivered in its
hall.  Not until such men as Charles Sumner, Theodore Parker, Ralph
Waldo Emerson, and Horace Mann refused to lecture in their course
while there was such a restriction, was it abandoned.
</p><p>Becoming satisfied that I could not rely on my trade in New
Bedford to give me a living, I prepared myself to do any kind of
work that came to hand.  I sawed wood, shoveled coal, dug cellars,
moved rubbish from back yards, worked on the wharves, loaded and
unloaded vessels, and scoured their cabins.
</p><p>I afterward got steady work at the brass-foundry owned by Mr.
Richmond.  My duty here was to blow the bellows, swing the crane,
and empty the flasks in which castings were made; and at times this
was hot and heavy work.  The articles produced here were mostly for
ship work, and in the busy season the foundry was in operation
night and day.  I have often worked two nights and every working
day of the week.  My foreman, Mr. Cobb, was a good man, and more
than once protected me from abuse that one or more of the hands was
disposed to throw upon me.  While in this situation I had little
time for mental improvement.  Hard work, night and day, over a
furnace hot enough to keep the metal running like water, was more
favorable to action than thought; yet here I often nailed a
newspaper to the post near my bellows, and read while I was
performing the up and down motion of the heavy beam by which the
bellows was inflated and discharged.  It was the pursuit of
knowledge under difficulties, and I look back to it now, after so
many years, with some complacency and a little wonder that I could
have been so earnest and persevering in any pursuit other than for
my daily bread.  I certainly saw nothing in the conduct of those
around to inspire me with such interest: they were all devoted
exclusively to what their hands found to do.  I am glad to be able
to say that, during my engagement in this foundry, no complaint was
ever made against me that I did not do my work, and do it well.
The bellows which I worked by main strength was, after I left,
moved by a steam-engine.
