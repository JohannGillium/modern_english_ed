<opener>TO THE RAMBLER<lb/>

<salute>SIR,
</salute>

</opener>

<p>
I HAVE been but a little time conversant in the
world, yet I have already had frequent opportunities of observing the
little efficacy of remonstrance and complaint, which, however extorted
by oppression, or supported by reason, are detested by one part of the world as rebellion, censured by another as peevishness, by some heard with an
appearance of compassion, only to betray any of those sallies of vehemence and resentment, which are apt
to break out upon encouragement, and by others passed over with indifference and neglect, as matters
in which they have no concern, and which if they should endeavour to examine or regulate, they
might draw mischief upon themselves. </p>

<p>Yet since it is no less natural for those who think
themselves injured to complain, than for others to
neglect their complaints, I shall venture to lay my

<pb n="1"/>

case before you, in hopes that you will enforce my
opinion, if you think it just, or endeavour to rectify
my sentiments, if I am mistaken.  I expect at least,
that you will divest yourself of partiality, and that
whatever your age or solemnity may be, you will
not, with the dotard's insolence, pronounce me
ignorant and foolish, perverse and refractory, only
because you perceive that I am young.
</p>

 <p>My father dying when I was but ten years old, left me, and a brother two years younger than myself, to the care of my mother, a woman of birth and education, whose prudence or virtue he had no reason to distrust.  She felt, for some time, all the sorrow which nature calls forth, upon the final separation of persons dear to one another; and as her grief was exhausted by its own violence, it subsided into tenderness for me and my brother, and the year of mourning was spent in caresses, consolations, and instruction, in celebration of my father's virtues, in professions of perpetual regard to his memory, and hourly instances of such fondness as gratitude will not easily suffer me to forget.
</p>

<p>But when the term of this mournful felicity was
expired, and my mother appeared again without
the ensigns of sorrow, the ladies of her acquaintance
began to tell her, upon whatever motives, that it
was time to live like the rest of the world; a
powerful argument, which is seldom used to a woman
without effect.  Lady Giddy was incessantly relating
the occurrences of the town, and Mrs. Gravely told
her privately, with great tenderness, that it began

<pb n="2"/>

to be publickly observed how much she overacted
her part, and that most of her acquaintance
suspected her hope of procuring another husband to
be the true ground of all that appearance of
tenderness and piety.
</p>

<p>All the officiousness of kindness and folly was
busied to change her conduct.  She was at one time
alarmed with censure, and at another fired with
praise.  She was told of balls, where others shone
only because she was absent; of new comedies, to
which all the town was crowding; and of many
ingenious ironies, by which domestick diligence was
made contemptible.
</p>

<p>It is difficult for virtue to stand alone against
fear on one side, and pleasure on the other; especially
when no actual crime is proposed, and prudence
itself can suggest many reasons for relaxation and
indulgence.  My mamma was at last persuaded to
accompany Miss Giddy to a play.  She was received
with a boundless profusion of compliments, and
attended home by a very fine gentleman.  Next day
she was with less difficulty prevailed on to play at
Mrs. Gravely's, and came home gay and lively; for
the distinctions that had been paid her awakened
her vanity, and good luck had kept her principles
of frugality from giving her disturbance.  She now
made her second entrance into the world, and her
friends were sufficiently industrious to prevent any
return to her former life; every morning brought
messages of invitation, and every evening was
passed in places of diversion, from which she for

<pb n="3"/>

some time complained that she had rather be
absent.  In a short time she began to feel the
happiness of acting without controul, of being
unaccountable for her hours, her expenses, and her
company; and learned by degrees to drop an
expression of contempt, or pity, at the mention of
ladies whose husbands were suspected of restraining
their pleasures, or their play, and confessed that
she loved to go and come as she pleased.
</p>

<p>I was still favoured with some incidental precepts
and transient endearments, and was now and then
fondly kissed for smiling like my papa: but most
part of her morning was spent in comparing the
opinion of her maid and milliner, contriving some
variation in her dress, visiting shops, and sending
compliments; and the rest of the day was too short
for visits, cards, plays, and concerts.
</p>

<p>She now began to discover that it was impossible
to educate children properly at home.  Parents could
not have them always in their sight; the society
of servants was contagious; company produced
boldness and spirit; emulation excited industry;
and a large school was naturally the first step into
the open world.  A thousand other reasons she alleged,
some of little force in themselves, but so
well seconded by pleasure, vanity, and idleness,
that they soon overcame all the remaining principles
of kindness and piety, and both I and my
brother were despatched to boarding schools.
</p>

<p>How my mamma spent her time when she was
thus disburthened I am not able to inform you,

<pb n="4"/>

but I have reason to believe that trifles and amusements
took still faster hold of her heart.  At first,
she visited me at school, and afterwards wrote to
me; but in a short time, both her visits and her
letters were at an end, and no other notice was
taken of me than to remit money for my support.
</p>

<p>When I came home at the vacation, I found
myself coldly received, with an observation, "that
this girl will presently be a woman."  I was, after
the usual stay, sent to school again, and overheard
my mother say, as I was a-going, "Well, now I
shall recover."
</p>

<p>In six months more I came again, and, with the
usual childish alacrity, was running to my mother's
embrace, when she stopt me with exclamations at
the suddenness and enormity of my growth, having,
she said, never seen any body shoot up so
much at my age.  She was sure no other girls spread
at that rate, and she hated to have children look
like women before their time.  I was disconcerted,
and retired without hearing any thing more than
"Nay, if you are hungry, Madam Steeple, you
may walk off."
</p>

<p>When once the forms of civility are violated,
there remains little hope of return to kindness or
decency.  My mamma made this appearance of
resentment a reason for continuing her malignity;
and poor Miss Maypole, for that was my appellation,
was never mentioned or spoken to but with
some expression of anger or dislike.
</p>

<p>She had yet the pleasure of dressing me like a

<pb n="5"/>

child, and I know not when I should have been
thought fit to change my habit, had I not been
rescued by a maiden sister of my father, who could
not bear to see women in hanging-sleeves, and
therefore presented me with brocade for a gown,
for which I should have thought myself under
great obligations, had she not accompanied her
favour with some hints that my mamma might
now consider her age, and give me her ear-rings,
which she had shewn long enough in publick
places.
</p>

<p>I now left the school, and came to live with my
mamma, who considered me as an usurper that had
seized the rights of a woman before they were due,
and was pushing her down the precipice of age, that
I might reign without a superior.  While I am thus
beheld with jealousy and suspicion, you will readily
believe that it is difficult to please.  Every word and
look is an offence.  I never speak, but I pretend to
some qualities and excellencies which it is criminal
to possess; if I am gay, she thinks it early enough
to coquette; if I am grave, she hates a prude in bibs;
if I venture into company, I am in haste for a
husband; if I retire to my chamber, such matron-like
ladies are lovers of contemplation.  I am on one
pretence or other generally excluded from her assemblies,
nor am I ever suffered to visit at the same
place with my mamma.  Every one wonders why
she does not bring Miss more into the world, and
when she comes home in vapours I am certain that
she has heard either of my beauty or my wit, and

<pb n="6"/>

expect nothing for the ensuing week but taunts and
menaces, contradiction and reproaches.
</p>

<p>Thus I live in a state of continual persecution,
only because I was born ten years too soon, and
cannot stop the course of nature or of time, but am
unhappily a woman before my mother can willingly
mocease to be a girl.  I believe you would contribute
to the happiness of many families, if, by any
arguments or persuasions, you could make mothers
ashamed of rivalling their children; if you could
shew them, that though they may refuse to grow
wise, they must inevitably grow old; and that the
proper solaces of age are not musick and
compliments, but wisdom and devotion; that those who
are so unwilling to quit the world will soon be driven
from it; and that it is therefore their interest to
retire while there yet remain a few hours for nobler

</epigraph>

<p>NOTHING is more unpleasing than to find that
offence has been received when none was
intended, and that pain has been given to those who
were not guilty of any provocation.  As the great

<pb n="7"/>

end of society is mutual beneficence, a good man is
always uneasy when he finds himself acting in
opposition to the purposes of life; because, though
his conscience may easily acquit him of <hi rend="italic">malice
prepense</hi>, of settled hatred or contrivances of mischief,
yet he seldom can be certain, that he has not failed by negligence, or indolence; that he has not been hindered from consulting the common interest by too much regard to his own ease, or
too much
indifference to the happiness of others.
</p>

<p>Nor is it necessary, that, to feel this uneasiness,
the mind should be extended to any great diffusion
of generosity, or melted by uncommon warmth of
benevolence; for that prudence which the world
teaches, and a quick sensibility of private interest,
will direct us to shun needless enmities; since there
is no man whose kindness we may not some time
want, or by whose malice we may not some time
suffer.
</p>

<p>I have therefore frequently looked with wonder,
and now and then with pity, at the thoughtlessness
with which some alienate from themselves the
affections of all whom chance, business, or inclination,
brings in their way.  When we see a man pursuing
some darling interest, without much regard
to the opinion of the world, we justly consider him
as corrupt and dangerous, but are not long in
discovering his motives; we see him actuated by
passions which are hard to be resisted, and deluded by
appearances which have dazzled stronger eyes.  But
the greater part of those who set mankind at de-
<pb n="8"/>

fiance by hourly irritation, and who live but to infuse
malignity, and multiply enemies, have no
hopes to foster, no designs to promote, nor any
expectations of attaining power by insolence, or of
climbing to greatness by trampling on others.
They give up all the sweets of kindness, for the
sake of peevishness, petulance, or gloom; and
alienate the world by neglect of the common forms of
civility, and breach of the established laws of
conversation.
</p>

<p>Every one must, in the walks of life, have met
with men of whom all speak with censure, though
they are not chargeable with any crime, and whom
none can be persuaded to love, though a reason can
scarcely be assigned why they should be hated; and
who, if their good qualities and actions sometimes
force a commendation, have their panegyrick always
concluded with confessions of disgust; "he is a good
man, but I cannot like him."  Surely such persons
have sold the esteem of the world at too low a price,
since they have lost one of the rewards of virtue,
without gaining the profits of wickedness.
</p>

<p>This ill economy of fame is sometimes the effect
of stupidity.  Men whose perceptions are languid
and sluggish, who lament nothing but loss of money,
and feel nothing but a blow, are often at a difficulty
to guess why they are encompassed with enemies,
though they neglect all those arts by which men
are endeared to one another.  They comfort themselves
that they have lived irreproachably; that none
can charge them with having endangered his life,

<pb n="9"/>

or diminished his possessions; and therefore conclude
that they suffer by some invincible fatality,
or impute the malice of their neighbours to
ignorance or envy.  They wrap themselves up in their
innocence, and enjoy the congratulations of their
own hearts, without knowing or suspecting that
they are every day deservedly incurring resentments,
by withholding from those with whom they
converse, that regard, or appearance of regard, to
which every one is entitled by the customs of the
world.
</p>

<p>There are many injuries which almost every man
feels, though he does not complain, and which, upon
those whom virtue, elegance, or vanity, have made
delicate and tender, fix deep and lasting impressions;
as there are many arts of graciousness and conciliation,
which are to be practised without expense,
and by which those may be made our friends, who
have never received from us any real benefit.  Such
arts, when they include neither guilt nor meanness,
it is surely reasonable to learn, for who would want
that love which is so easily to be gained?  And such
injuries are to be avoided; for who would be hated
without profit?
</p>

<p>Some, indeed, there are, for whom the excuse of
ignorance or negligence cannot be alleged, because
it is apparent that they are not only careless of
pleasing, but studious to offend; that they contrive
to make all approaches to them difficult and vexatious,
and imagine that they aggrandize themselves
by wasting the time of others in useless attendance,

<pb n="10"/>

by mortifying them with slights, and teazing them
with affronts.
</p>

<p>Men of this kind are generally to be found
among those that have not mingled much in general
conversation, but spent their lives amidst the
obsequiousness of dependents, and the flattery of
parasites; and by long consulting only their own
inclination, have forgotten that others have claim to
the same deference.
</p>

<p>Tyranny thus avowed, is indeed an exuberance of
pride, by which all mankind is so much enraged, that
it is never quietly endured, except in those who can
reward the patience which they exact; and insolence
is generally surrounded only by such whose baseness
inclines them to think nothing insupportable that
produces gain, and who can laugh at scurrility
and rudeness with a luxurious table and an open
purse.
</p>

<p>But though all wanton provocations and
contemptuous insolence are to be diligently avoided,
there is no less danger in timid compliance and
tame resignation.  It is common for soft and fearful
tempers to give themselves up implicitly to the
direction of the bold, the turbulent, and the
overbearing; of those whom they do not believe wiser
or better than themselves; to recede from the best
designs where opposition must be encountered, and
to fall off from virtue for fear of censure.
</p>

<p>Some firmness and resolution is necessary to the
discharge of duty; but it is a very unhappy state
of life in which the necessity of such struggles

<pb n="11"/>

frequently occurs; for no man is defeated without
some resentment, which will be continued with
obstinacy while he believes himself in the right,
and exerted with bitterness, if even to his own
conviction he is detected in the wrong.
</p>

<p>Even though no regard be had to the external
consequences of contrariety and dispute, it must be
painful to a worthy mind to put others in pain,
and there will be danger lest the kindest nature
may be vitiated by too long a custom of debate
and contest.
</p>

<p>I am afraid that I may be taxed with insensibility
by many of my correspondents, who believe their
contributions unjustly neglected.  And, indeed, when
I sit before a pile of papers, of which each is the
production of laborious study, and the offspring
of a fond parent, I, who know the passions of an
author, cannot remember how long they have lain
in my boxes unregarded, without imagining to
myself the various changes of sorrow, impatience,
and resentment, which the writers must have felt
in this tedious interval.
</p>

<p>These reflections are still more awakened, when,
upon perusal, I find some of them calling for a
place in the next paper, a place which they have
never yet obtained: others writing in a style of
superiority and haughtiness, as secure of deference,
and above fear of criticism; others humbly offering
their weak assistance with softness and submission,
which they believe impossible to be resisted; some
introducing their compositions with a menace of

<pb n="12"/>

the contempt which he that refuses them will
incur; others applying privately to the booksellers
for their interest and solicitation; every one by
different ways endeavouring to secure the bliss
of publication.  I cannot but consider myself as
placed in a very incommodious situation, where I
am forced to repress confidence, which it is pleasing
to indulge, to repay civilities with appearances of
neglect, and so frequently to offend those by whom
I never was offended.
</p>

<p>I know well how rarely an author, fired with the
beauties of his new composition, contains his
raptures in his own bosom, and how naturally he
imparts to his friends his expectations of renown;
and as I can easily conceive the eagerness with
which a new paper is snatched up, by one who
expects to find it filled with his own production,
and perhaps has called his companions to share the
pleasure of a second perusal, I grieve for the
disappointment which he is to feel at the fatal
inspection.  His hopes, however, do not yet forsake him;
he is certain of giving lustre the next day.  The
next day comes, and again he pants with expectation,
and having dreamed of laurels and Parnassus,
casts his eyes upon the barren page, with which he
is doomed never more to be delighted.
</p>

<p>For such cruelty what atonement can be made?
For such calamities what alleviation can be found?
I am afraid that the mischief already done must be
without reparation, and all that deserves my care is
prevention for the future.  Let therefore the next

<pb n="13"/>

friendly contributor, whoever he be, observe the
cautions of Swift, and write secretly in his own
chamber, without communicating his design to his
nearest friend, for the nearest friend will be pleased
with an opportunity of laughing.  Let him carry it
to the post himself, and wait in silence for the
event.  If it is published and praised, he may then
declare himself the author; if it be suppressed, he
may wonder in private without much vexation; and
if it be censured, he may join in the cry, and lament
the dulness of the writing generation.

<p> The world has not yet learned the riches of frugality.
</p>

</epigraph>

<opener>TO THE RAMBLER<lb/>

<salute>SIR,
</salute>

</opener>

<p>
I AM always pleased when I see literature made
useful, and scholars descending from that elevation,
which, as it raises them above common life,
must likewise hinder them from beholding the ways
of men otherwise than in a cloud of bustle and
confusion.  Having lived a life of business, and remarked
how seldom any occurrences emerge for which great
qualities are required, I have learned the necessity of
regarding little things; and though I do not pretend
to give laws to the legislators of mankind, or to limit
the range of those powerful minds that carry light
and heat through all the regions of knowledge, yet

<pb n="14"/>

I have long thought, that the greatest part of those
who lose themselves in studies by which I have not
found that they grow much wiser, might, with more
advantage both to the publick and themselves, apply
their understandings to domestick arts, and store
their minds with axioms of humble prudence, and
private economy.
</p>

<p>Your late paper on frugality was very elegant and
pleasing, but, in my opinion, not sufficiently adapted
to common readers, who pay little regard to the
musick of periods, the artifice of connection, or the
arrangement of the flowers of rhetorick; but require
a few plain and cogent instructions, which may sink
into the mind by their own weight.
</p>

<p>Frugality is so necessary to the happiness of the
world, so beneficial in its various forms to every rank
of men, from the highest of human potentates, to
the lowest labourer or artificer; and the miseries
which the neglect of it produces are so numerous
and so grievous, that it ought to be recommended
with every variation of address, and adapted to every
class of understanding.
</p>

<p>Whether those who treat morals as a science will
allow frugality to be numbered among the virtues,
I have not thought it necessary to inquire.  For I,
who draw my opinions from a careful observation
of the world, am satisfied with knowing what is
abundantly sufficient for practice; that if it be not
a virtue, it is, at least, a quality which can seldom
exist without some virtues, and without which few
virtues can exist.  Frugality may be termed the

<pb n="15"/>

daughter of prudence, the sister of temperance, and
the parent of liberty.  He that is extravagant will
quickly become poor, and poverty will enforce
dependence, and invite corruption; it will almost
always produce a passive compliance with the wickedness
of others; and there are few who do not learn
by degrees to practice those crimes which they
cease to censure.
</p>

<p>If there are any who do not dread poverty as
dangerous to virtue, yet mankind seem unanimous
enough in abhorring it as destructive to happiness;
and all to whom want is terrible, upon whatever
principle, ought to think themselves obliged to learn
the sage maxims of our parsimonious ancestors, and
attain the salutary arts of contracting expense; for
without frugality none can be rich, and with it very
few would be poor.
</p>

<p>To most other acts of virtue or exertions of wisdom,
a concurrence of many circumstances is necessary,
some previous knowledge must be attained,
some uncommon gifts of nature possessed, or some
opportunity produced by an extraordinary combination
of things; but the mere power of saving what
is already in our hands, must be easy of acquisition
to every mind; and as the example of Bacon may
shew, that the highest intellect cannot safely neglect
it, a thousand instances will every day prove, that
the meanest may practise it with success.
</p>

<p>Riches cannot be within the reach of great numbers,
because to be rich is to possess more than is
commonly placed in a single hand; and, if many

<pb n="16"/>

could obtain the sum which now makes a man
wealthy, the name of wealth must then be transferred
to still greater accumulation.  But I am not
certain that it is equally impossible to exempt the
lower classes of mankind from poverty; because,
though whatever be the wealth of the community,
some will always have least, and he that has less
than any other is comparatively poor; yet I do not
see any co-active necessity that many should be
without the indispensable conveniences of life; but
am sometimes inclined to imagine, that, casual
calamities excepted, there might, by universal
prudence, be procured an universal exemption from
want; and that he who should happen to have least,
might notwithstanding have enough.
</p>

<p>But without entering too far into speculations
which I do not remember that any political calculator
has attempted, and in which the most perspicacious
reasoner may be easily bewildered, it is
evident that they to whom Providence has allotted
no other care but of their own fortune and their
own virtue, which make far the greater part of mankind,
have sufficient incitements to personal frugality,
since, whatever might be its general effect upon
provinces or nations, by which it is never likely to
be tried, we know with certainty, that there is
scarcely any individual entering the world, who, by
prudent parsimony, may not reasonably promise
himself a cheerful competence in the decline of
life.
</p>

<p>The prospect of penury in age is so gloomy and

<pb n="17"/>

terrifying, that every man who looks before him
must resolve to avoid it; and it must be avoided
generally by the science of sparing.  For, though
in every age there are some, who by bold adventures,
or by favourable accidents, rise suddenly
to riches, yet it is dangerous to indulge hopes of
such rare events: and the bulk of mankind must
owe their affluence to small and gradual profits,
below which their expense must be resolutely
reduced.
</p>

<p>You must not therefore think me sinking below
the dignity of a practical philosopher, when I
recommend to the consideration of your readers, from
the statesmen to the apprentice, a position replete
with mercantile wisdom, <hi rend="italic">A penny saved is two-pence
got</hi>; which may, I think, be accommodated to all
conditions, by observing not only that they who
pursue any lucrative employment will save time when
they forbear expense, and that the time may be
employed to the increase of profit; but that they who
are above such minute considerations will find, by
every victory over appetite or passion, new strength
added to the mind, will gain the power of refusing
those solicitations by which the young and
vivacious are hourly assaulted, and in time set
themselves above the reach of extravagance and
folly.
</p>

<p>It may, perhaps, be inquired by those who are willing
rather to cavil than to learn, what is the just
measure of frugality? and when expense, not
absolutely necessary, degenerates into profusion?  To

<pb n="18"/>

such questions no general answer can be returned;
since the liberty of spending, or necessity of parsimony,
may be varied without end by different circumstances.
It may, however, be laid down as a rule
never to be broken, that a <hi rend="italic">man's voluntary expense
should not exceed his revenue</hi>.  A maxim so obvious
and incontrovertible, that the civil law ranks the
prodigal with the madman<ref target="JohRamb.1">[p]</ref>, and debars them equally
from the conduct of their own affairs.  Another precept
arising from the former, and indeed included
in it, is yet necessary to be distinctly impressed
upon the warm, the fanciful, and the brave; <hi rend="italic">Let no
man anticipate uncertain profits</hi>.  Let no man presume
to spend upon hopes, to trust his own abilities
for means of deliverance from penury, to give
a loose to his present desires, and leave the
reckoning to fortune or to virtue.
</p>

<p>To these cautions, which, I suppose, are, at least
among the graver part of mankind, undisputed, I
will add another, <hi rend="italic">Let no man squander against his
inclination</hi>.  With this precept it may be, perhaps,
imagined easy to comply; yet if those whom profusion
has buried in prisons, or driven into banishment,
were examined, it would be found that very
few were ruined by their own choice, or purchased
pleasure with the loss of their estates; but that
they suffered themselves to be borne away by the
violence of those with whom they conversed, and
yielded reluctantly to a thousand prodigalities,
either from a trivial emulation of wealth and spirit,

<pb n="19"/>

or a mean fear of contempt and ridicule; an emulation
for the prize of folly, or the dread of the laugh
of fools.

</epigraph>

<p>AS the love of money has been, in all ages, one
of the passions that have given great disturbance
to the tranquillity of the world, there is no
topick more copiously treated by the ancient
moralists than the folly of devoting the heart to the
accumulation of riches.  They who are acquainted
with these authors need not be told how riches
excite pity, contempt, or reproach, whenever they
are mentioned; with what numbers of examples
the danger of large possessions is illustrated; and
how all the powers of reason and eloquence have
been exhausted in endeavours to eradicate a desire,
which seems to have intrenched itself too strongly
in the mind to be driven out, and which, perhaps,
had not lost its power, even over those who
declaimed against it, but would have broken out in
the poet or the sage, if it has been excited by


<pb n="20"/>

opportunity, and invigorated by the approximation
of its proper object.
</p>

<p>Their arguments have been, indeed, so unsuccessful,
that I know not whether it can be shewn,
that by all the wit and reason which this favourite
cause has called forth, a single convert was ever
made; that even one man has refused to be rich,
when to be rich was in his power, from the conviction
of the greater happiness of a narrow fortune;
or disburthened himself of wealth when he had
tried its inquietudes, merely to enjoy the peace
and leisure and security of a mean and unenvied
state.
</p>

<p>It is true, indeed, that many have neglected
opportunities of raising themselves to honours and
to wealth, and rejected the kindest offers of fortune:
but however their moderation may be boasted by
themselves, or admired by such as only view them
at a distance, it will be, perhaps, seldom found that
they value riches less, but that they dread labour
or danger more, than others; they are unable to
rouse themselves to action, to strain in the race of
competition, or to stand the shock of contest; but
though they, therefore, decline the toil of climbing,
they nevertheless wish themselves aloft, and would
willingly enjoy what they dare not seize.
</p>

<p>Others have retired from high stations, and
voluntarily condemned themselves to privacy and
obscurity.  But even these will not afford many
occasions of triumph to the philosopher; for they
have commonly either quitted that only which

<pb n="21"/>

they thought themselves unable to hold, and prevented
disgrace by resignation; or they have been
induced to try new measures by general inconstancy,
which always dreams of happiness in novelty,
or by a gloomy disposition, which is disgusted
in the same degree with every state, and wishes
every scene of life to change as soon as it is beheld.
Such men found high and low stations equally unable
to satisfy the wishes of a distempered mind, and
were unable to shelter themselves in the closest
retreat from disappointment, solicitude, and misery.
</p>

<p>Yet though these admonitions have been thus
neglected by those who either enjoyed riches, or
were able to procure them, it is not rashly to be
determined that they are altogether without use;
for since far the greatest part of mankind must be
confined to conditions comparatively mean, and
placed in situations from which they naturally look
up with envy to the eminences before them, those
writers cannot be thought ill employed that have
administered remedies to discontent almost universal,
by shewing, that what we cannot reach may
very well be forborne; that the inequality of
distribution, at which we murmur, is for the most part
less than it seems, and that the greatness, which we
admire at a distance, has much fewer advantages,
and much less splendour, when we are suffered to
approach it.
</p>

<p>It is the business of moralists to detect the frauds
of fortune, and to shew that she imposes upon the
careless eye, by a quick succession of shadows, which

<pb n="22"/>

will shrink to nothing in the gripe; that she disguises
life in extrinsick ornaments, which serve only
for shew, and are laid aside in the hours of solitude,
and of pleasure; and that when greatness aspires
either to felicity or to wisdom, it shakes off those
distinctions which dazzle the gazer, and awe the
supplicant.
</p>

<p>It maybe remarked, that they whose condition has
not afforded them the light of moral or religious
instruction, and who collect all their ideas by their
own eyes, and digest them by their own understandings,
seem to consider those who are placed in ranks
of remote superiority, as almost another and higher
species of beings.  As themselves have known little
other misery than the consequences of want, they
are with difficulty persuaded that where there is
wealth there can be sorrow, or that those who glitter
in dignity, and glide along in affluence, can be
acquainted with pains and cares like those which lie
heavy upon the rest of mankind.
</p>

<p>This prejudice is, indeed, confined to the lowest
meanness, and the darkest ignorance; but it is so
confined only because others have been shewn its
folly, and its falsehood, because it has been opposed
in its progress by history and philosophy, and hindered
from spreading its infection by powerful
preservatives.
</p>

<p>The doctrine of the contempt of wealth, though
it has not been able to extinguish avarice or ambition,
or suppress that reluctance with which a man
passes his days in a state of inferiority, must, at

<pb n="23"/>

least, have made the lower conditions less grating
and wearisome, and has consequently contributed
to the general security of life, by hindering that
fraud and violence, rapine and circumvention, which
must have been produced by an unbounded eagerness
of wealth, arising from an unshaken conviction
that to be rich is to be happy.
</p>

<p>Whoever finds himself incited, by some violent
impulse of passion, to pursue riches as the chief end
of being, must surely be so much alarmed by the
successive admonitions of those whose experience
and sagacity have recommended them as the guides
of mankind, as to stop and consider whether he is
about to engage in an undertaking that will reward
his toil, and to examine, before he rushes to wealth,
through right and wrong, what it will confer when
he has acquired it; and this examination will seldom
fail to repress his ardour, and retard his violence.
</p>

<p>Wealth is nothing in itself, it is not useful but
when it departs from us; its value is found only in
that which it can purchase, which, if we suppose it
put to its best use by those that possess it, seems
not much to deserve the desire or envy of a wise
man.  It is certain that, with regard to corporal
enjoyment, money can neither open new avenues to
pleasure, nor block up the passages of anguish.  Disease
and infirmity still continue to torture and enfeeble,
perhaps exasperated by luxury, or promoted
by softness.  With respect to the mind, it has rarely
been observed, that wealth contributes much to
quicken the discernment, enlarge the capacity, or

<pb n="24"/>

elevate the imagination; but may, by hiring flattery,
or laying diligence asleep, confirm errour, and
harden stupidity.
</p>

<p>Wealth cannot confer greatness, for nothing can
make that great, which the decree of nature has
ordained to be little.  The bramble may be placed
in a hot-bed, but can never become an oak.  Even
royalty itself is not able to give that dignity which
it happens not to find, but oppresses feeble minds,
though it may elevate the strong.  The world has
been governed in the name of kings, whose existence
has scarcely been perceived by any real effects
beyond their own palaces.
</p>

<p>When therefore the desire of wealth is taking
hold of the heart, let us look round and see how it
operates upon those whose industry or fortune has
obtained it.  When we find them oppressed with
their own abundance, luxurious without pleasure,
idle without ease, impatient and querulous in themselves,
and despised or hated by the rest of mankind,
we shall soon be convinced, that if the real wants
of our condition are satisfied, there remains little
to be sought with solicitude, or desired with
eagerness.

<p>IT is common to distinguish men by the names

Thus a hero is frequently termed a lion, and a
statesman a fox, an extortioner gains the appellation
of vulture, and a fop the title of monkey.  There

which a survey of the world exhibits, a species of

marked out as the screech-owls of mankind.
</p>

<p>These screech-owls seem to be settled in an
opinion that the great business of life is to complain,
and that they were born for no other purpose
than to disturb the happiness of others, to lessen
the little comforts, and shorten the short pleasures
of our condition, by painful remembrances of the
past, or melancholy prognosticks of the future;
their only care is to crush the rising hope, to damp
the kindling transport, and allay the golden hours of
gaiety with the hateful dross of grief and suspicion.

<p>To those whose weakness of spirits, or timidity
of temper, subjects them to impressions from
others, and who are apt to suffer by fascination,
and catch the contagion of misery, it is extremely
unhappy to live within the compass of a screech-owl's voice; for it will often fill their ears in the
hour of dejection, terrify them with apprehensions,
which their own thoughts would never have produced,
and sadden, by intruded sorrows, the day
which might have been passed in amusements or in
business; it will burthen the heart with unnecessary
discontents, and weaken for a time that love of life
which is necessary to the vigorous prosecution of
any undertaking.
</p>

<p>Though I have, like the rest of mankind, many
failings and weaknesses, I have not yet, by either
friends or enemies, been charged with superstition;
I never count the company which I enter, and I
look at the new moon indifferently over either
shoulder.  I have, like most other philosophers, often
heard the cuckoo without money in my pocket,
and have been sometimes reproached as fool-hardy
for not turning down my eyes when a raven flew
over my head.  I never go home abruptly because a
snake crosses my way, nor have any particular
dread of a climacterical year; yet I confess
that, with all my scorn of old women, and their
tales, I consider it as an unhappy day when I happen
to be greeted, in the morning, by Suspirius
the screech-owl.
</p>

<p>I have now known Suspirius fifty-eight years and

<pb n="27"/>

four months, and have never yet passed an hour with
him in which he has not made some attack upon my
quiet.  When we were first acquainted, his great
topick was the misery of youth without riches; and
whenever we walked out together he solaced me with
a long enumeration of pleasures, which, as they were
beyond the reach of my fortune, were without the
verge of my desires, and which I should never have
considered as the objects of a wish, had not his
unseasonable representations placed them in my sight.
</p>

<p>Another of his topicks is the neglect of merit,
with which he never fails to amuse every man whom
he sees not eminently fortunate.  If he meets with a
young officer, he always informs him of gentlemen
whose personal courage is unquestioned, and whose
military skill qualifies them to command armies, that
have, notwithstanding all their merit, grown old
with subaltern commissions.  For a genius in the
church, he is always provided with a curacy for life.
The lawyer he informs of many men of great parts
and deep study, who have never had an opportunity
to speak in the courts: and meeting Serenus the
physician, "Ah, doctor," says he, "what a-foot still,
when so many block-heads are rattling in their chariots?
I told you seven years ago that you would never
meet with encouragement, and I hope you will now
take more notice, when I tell you that your Greek,
and your diligence, and your honesty, will never
enable you to live like yonder apothecary, who
prescribes to his own shop, and laughs at the
physician."

<pb n="28"/>

</p>

<p>Suspirius has, in his time, intercepted fifteen
authors in their way to the stage; persuaded nine
and thirty merchants to retire from a prosperous
trade for fear of bankruptcy, broke off an hundred
and thirteen matches by prognostications of unhappiness,
and enabled the small-pox to kill nineteen
ladies, by perpetual alarms of the loss of beauty.
</p>

<p>Whenever my evil stars bring us together, he
never fails to represent to me the folly of my pursuits,
and informs me that we are much older than when
we began our acquaintance, that the infirmities of
decrepitude are coming fast upon me, that whatever
I now get, I shall enjoy but a little time, that
fame is to a man tottering on the edge of the grave
of very little importance, and that the time is at
hand when I ought to look for no other pleasures
than a good dinner and an easy chair.
</p>

<p>Thus he goes on in his unharmonious strain,
displaying present miseries, and foreboding more,
every syllable is loaded with
misfortune, and death is always brought nearer to
the view.  Yet, what always raises my resentment
and indignation, I do not perceive that his mournful
meditations have much effect upon hirmself.  He
talks and has long talked of calamities, without
discovering otherwise than by the tone of his voice,
that he feels any of the evils which he bewails or
threatens, but has the same habit of uttering lamentations,
as others of telling stories, and falls into
expressions of condolence for past, or apprehension
of future mischiefs, as all men studious of their ease

<pb n="29"/>

have recourse to those subjects upon which they can
most fluently or copiously discourse<ref target="JohRamb.2">[q]</ref>.


<note id="JohRamb.2"><seg type="note-symbol">[q]</seg> <p>Suspirius, the screech-owl, is presumed by some to have suggested the
character of Croaker to Goldsmith, in his Comedy of the Good-natured
Man.
</p></note>

</p>

<p>It is reported of the Sybarites, that they destroyed
all their cocks, that they might dream out their
morning dreams without disturbance.  Though I
would not so far promote effeminacy as to propose
the Sybarites for an example, yet since there is no
man so corrupt or foolish, but something useful may
be learned from him, I could wish that, in imitation
of a people not often to be copied, some regulations
might be made to exclude screech-owls from all
company, as the enemies of mankind, and confine
them to some proper receptacle, where they may
mingle sighs at leisure, and thicken the gloom of
one another.
</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Thou profit of evil</hi>, says Homer's Agamemnon,
<hi rend="italic">thou never foretellest me good, but thejJoy of thy
heart is to predict misfortunes</hi>.  Whoever is of the
same temper, might there find the means of indulging
his thoughts, and improving his vein of denunciation,
and the flock of screech-owls might hoot
together without injury to the rest of the world.
</p>

<p>Yet, though I have so little kindness for this dark
generation, I am very far from intending to debar
the soft and tender mind from the privilege of
complaining, when the sigh arises from the desire not
of giving pain, but of gaining ease.  To hear
complaints with patience, even when complaints are

<pb n="30"/>

vain, is one of the duties of friendship; and though
it must be allowed that he suders most like a hero
that hides his grief in silence,

<q lang="lat" >
Spem vultu simulat, premit altum corde dolorem; <lb/>
<bibl>Aeneid, I.209.</bibl>
</q>

<q>His outward smiles conceal'd his inward smart;

<bibl>DRYDEN.
</bibl>
</q>

yet it cannot be denied, that he who complains acts
like a man, like a social being, who looks for help
from his fellow-creatures.  Pity is to many of the
unhappy a source of comfort in hopeless distresses,
as it contributes to recommend them to themselves,
by proving that they have not lost the regard of
others; and heaven seems to indicate the duty even
of barren compassion, by inclining us to weep for
evils which we cannot remedy.

</lg>
</epigraph>

<p>ALL joy or sorrow for the happiness or calamities
of others is produced by an act of the imagination,
that realizes the event however fictitious,
or approximates it however remote, by placing us,
for a time, in the condition of him whose fortune
we contemplate; so that we feel, while the
deception lasts, whatever motions would be excited by
the same good or evil happening to ourselves.

<pb n="31"/>

</p>

<p>Our passions are therefore more strongly moved,
in proportion as we can more readily adopt the pains
or pleasure proposed to our minds, by recognising
them as once our own, or considering them as
naturally incident to our state of life.  It is not easy
for the most artful writer to give us an interest in
happiness or misery, which we think ourselves never
likely to feel, and with which we have never yet been
made acquainted.  Histories of the downfal of kingdoms,
and revolutions of empires, are read with
great tranquillity; the imperial tragedy pleases
common auditors only by its pomp of ornament, and
grandeur of ideas; and the man whose faculties
have been engrossed by business, and whose heart
never fluttered but at the rise or fall of the stocks,
wonders how the attention can be seized, or the
affection agitated, by a tale of love.
</p>

<p>Those parallel circumstances and kindred images,
to which we readily conform our minds, are, above
all other writings, to be found in narratives of the
lives of particular persons; and therefore no species
of writing seems more worthy of cultivation than
biography, since none can be more delightful or
more useful, none can more certainly enchain the
heart by irresistible interest, or more widely diffuse
instruction to every diversity of condition.
</p>

<p>The general and rapid narratives of history, which
involve a thousand fortunes in the business a day,
and complicate innumerable incidents in one great
transaction, afford few lessons applicable to private
life, which derives its comforts and its wretchedness

<pb n="32"/>

from the right or wrong management of things,
which nothing but their frequency makes considerable,
<foreign lang="lat" ><hi rend="italic">Parva si non fiant quotidie</hi></foreign>, says Pliny, and
which can have no place in those relations which
never descend below the consultation of senates, the
motions of armies, and the schemes of conspirators.
</p>

<p>I have often thought that there has rarely passed
a life of which a judicious and faithful narrative would
not be useful.  For, not only every man has, in the
mighty mass of the world, great numbers in the same
condition with himself, to whom his mistakes and
miscarriages, escapes and expedients, would be of
immediate and apparent use; but there is such an
uniformity in the state of man, considered apart
from adventitious and separable decorations and
disguises, that there is scarce any possibility of good
or ill, but is common to human kind.  A great part
of the time of those who are placed at the greatest
distance by fortune, or by temper, must unavoidably
pass in the same manner; and though,when the
claims of nature are satisfied, caprice, and vanity,
and accident, begin to produce discriminations and
peculiarities, yet the eye is not very heedful or quick,
which cannot discover the same causes still terminating
their influence in the same effects, though
sometimes accelerated, sometimes retarded, or
perplexed by multiplied combinations.  We are all
prompted by the same motives, all deceived by the
same fallacies, all animated by hope, obstructed by
danger, entangled by desire, and seduced by pleasure.
</p>

<p>It is frequently objected to relations of particular

<pb n="33"/>

lives, that they are not distinguished by any striking
or wonderful vicissitudes.  The scholar who passed
his life among his books, the merchant who conducted
only his own affairs, the priest, whose sphere of action
was not extended beyond that of his duty, are
considered as no proper objects of publick regard,
however they might have excelled in their several
stations, whatever might have been their learning,
integrity, and piety.  But this notion arises from false
measures of excellence and dignity, and must be
eradicated by considering, that in the esteem of
uncorrupted reason, what is of most use is of most
value.
</p>

<p>It is, indeed, not improper to take honest advantages
of prejudice, and to gain attention by a celebrated
name; but the business of a biographer is
often to pass slightly over those performances and
incidents, which produce vulgar greatness, to lead
the thoughts into domestick privacies, and display
the minute details of daily life, where exterior
appendages are cast aside, and men excel each other only
by prudence and by virtue.  The account of Thuanus
is, with great propriety, said by its author to have
been written, that it might lay open to posterity the
private and familiar character of that man, <foreign lang="lat">
<hi rend="italic">cujus
ingenium et candorem, ex ipsius scriptis sunt olim
semper miraturi</hi></foreign>, whose candour and genius will to
the end of time be by his writings preserved in
admiration.
</p>

<p>There are many invisible circumstances which,
whether we read as inquirers after natural and moral

<pb n="34"/>

knowledge, whether we intend to enlarge our science,
or increase our virtue, are more important than
publick occurrences.  Thus Sallust, the great master
of nature, has not forgot, in his account of Cataline,
to remark that <hi rend="italic">his walk was now quick, and again
slow</hi>, as an indication of a mind revolving something
with violent commotion.  Thus the story of Melancthon
affords a striking lecture on the value of time,
by informing us, that when he made an appointment,
he expected not only the hour, but the minute to be
fixed, that the day might not run out in the idleness
of suspense: and all the plans and enterprizes of
De Witt are now of less importance to the world,
than that part of his personal character, which
represents him as <hi rend="italic">careful of his health, and negligent of
his life</hi>.
</p>

<p>But biography has often been allotted to writers
who seem very little acquainted with the nature of
their task, or very negligent about the performance.
</p>

<p>They rarely afford any other account than might
be collected from publick papers, but imagine themselves
writing a life when they exhibit a chronological
series of actions or preferments; and so little
regard the manners or behaviour of their heroes, that
more knowledge may be gained of a man's real character,
by a short conversation with one of his servants,
than from a formal and studied narrative,
begun with his pedigree, and ended with his funeral.
</p>

<p>If now and then they condescend to inform the
world of particular facts, they are not always so
happy as to select the most important.  I know not

<pb n="35"/>

well what advantage posterity can receive from the
only circumstance by which Tickell has distinguished
Addison from the rest of mankind, <hi rend="italic">the irregularity
of his pulse</hi>: nor can I think myself overpaid
for the time spent in reading the life of Malherb
by being enabled to relate after the learned biographer,
that Malherb had two predominant opinions;
one, that the looseness of a single woman might
destroy all her boast of ancient descent; the other,
that the French beggars made use very improperly
and barbarously of the phrase <hi rend="italic">noble
Gentleman</hi>,
because either word included the sense to both.
</p>

<p>There are, indeed, some natural reasons why
these narratives are often written by such as were
not likely to give much instruction or delight, and
why most accounts of particular persons are barren
and useless.  If a life be delayed till interest and
envy are at an end, we may hope for impartiality,
but must expect little intelligence; for the incidents
which give excellence to biography are of a volatile
and evanescent kind, such as soon escape the memory,
and are rarely transmitted by tradition.  We
know how few can pourtray a living acquaintance,
except by his most prominent and observable
particularities, and the grosser features of his mind; and
it may be easily imagined how much of this little
knowledge may be lost in imparting it, and how
soon a succession of copies will lose all resemblance
of the original.
</p>

<p>If the biographer writes from personal knowledge,
and makes haste to gratify the public curiosity,

<pb n="36"/>

there is danger lest his interest, his fear his
gratitude, or his tenderness, overpower his fidelity, and
tempt him to conceal, if not to invent.  There are
many who think it an act of piety to hide the faults
or failings of their friends, even when they can no
longer suffer by their detection; we therefore see
whole ranks of characters adorned with uniform
panegyrick, and not to be known from one another,
but by extrinsick and casual circumstances.  "Let
me remember," says Hale, "when I find myself
inclined to pity a criminal, that there is likewise a
pity due to the country."  If we owe regard to the
memory of the dead, there is yet more respect to be
paid to knowledge, to virtue, and to truth.

<opener>TO THE RAMBLER<lb/>
<salute>SIR,
</salute>
</opener>

<p>IT is extremely vexatious to a man of eager and
thirsty curiosity to be placed at a great distance
from the fountain of intelligence, and not only never
to receive the current of report till it has satiated
the greatest part of the nation, but at last to find it
mudded in its course, and corrupted with taints or
mixtures from every channel through which it
flowed.


<pb n="37"/>

</p>

<p>One of the chief pleasures of my life is to hear
what passes in the world; to know what are the
schemes of the politick, the aims of the busy, and
the hopes of the ambitious; what changes of publick
measures are approaching; who is likely to be
crushed in the collision of parties; who is climbing
to the top of power, and who is tottering on the
precipice of disgrace.  But as it is very common for
us to desire most what we are least qualified to
obtain, I have suffered this appetite of news to
outgrow all the gratifications which my present
situation can afford it; for being placed in a remote
country, I am condemned always to confound the
future with the past, to form prognostications of
events no longer doubtful, and to consider the
expediency of schemes already executed or defeated.
I am perplexed with a perpetual deception in my
prospects, like a man pointing his telescope at a
remote star, which before the light reaches his eye
has forsaken the place from which it was emitted.
</p>

<p>The mortification of being thus always behind
the active world in my reflections and discoveries,
is exceedingly aggravated by the petulance of those
whose health, or business, or pleasure, brings them
hither from London.  For, without considering the
insuperable disadvantages of my condition, and the
unavoidable ignorance which absence must produce,
they often treat me with the utmost superciliousness
of contempt, for not knowing what no human
sagacity can discover; and sometimes seem to
consider me as a wretch scarcely worthy of human

<pb n="38"/>

converse, when I happen to talk of the fortune of a
bankrupt, or propose the healths of the dead, when
I warn them of mischiefs already incurred, or wish
for measures that have been lately taken.  They
seem to attribute to the superiority of their
intellects what they only owe to the accident of their
condition, and think themselves indisputably
entitled to airs of insolence and authority, when they
find another ignorant of facts, which, because they
echoed in the streets of London, they suppose
equally publick in all other places, and known where
they could neither be seen, related, nor conjectured.
</p>

<p>To this haughtiness they are indeed too much
encouraged by the respect which they receive
amongst us, for no other reason than that they
come from London.  For no sooner is the arrival of
one of these disseminators of knowledge known in
the country, than we crowd about him from every
quarter, and by innumerable inquiries flatter him
into an opinion of his own importance.  He sees
himself surrounded by multitudes, who propose
their doubts, and refer their controversies, to him,
as to a being descended from some nobler region,
and he grows on a sudden oraculous and infallible,
solves all difficulties, and sets all objections at
defiance.
</p>

<p>There is, in my opinion, great reason for suspecting,
that they sometimes take advantage of this
reverential modesty, and impose upon rustick
understandings, with a false show of universal
intelligence; for I do not find that they are willing to

<pb n="39"/>

own themselves ignorant of any thing, or that they
dismiss any inquirer with a positive and decisive
answer.  The court, the city, the park, and exchange,
are to those men of unbounded observation equally
familiar, and they are alike ready to tell the hour
at which stocks will rise, or the ministry be changed.
</p>

<p>A short residence at London entitles a man to
knowledge, to wit, to politeness, and to a despotick
and dictatorial power of prescribing to the rude
multitude, whom he condescends to honour with a
biennial visit; yet, I know not well upon what
motives, I have lately found myself inclined to
cavil at this prescription, and to doubt whether it
be not, on some occasions, proper to withhold our
veneration, till we are more authentically convinced
of the merits of the claimant.
</p>

<p>It is well remembered here, that about seven
years ago, one Frolick, a tall boy, with lank hair,
remarkable for stealing eggs, and sucking them,
was taken from the school in this parish, and sent
up to London to study the law.  As he had given
amongst us no proofs of a genius designed by
nature for extraordinary performances, he was,
from the time of his departure, totally forgotten,
nor was there any talk of his vices or virtues, his
good or his ill fortune, till last summer a report
burst upon us, that Mr. Frolick was come down in
the first post-chaise which this village had seen,
having travelled with such rapidity that one of his
postillions had broke his leg, and another narrowly
escaped suffocation in a quicksand; but that Mr.

<pb n="40"/>

Frolick seemed totally unconcerned, for such things
were never heeded at London.
</p>

<p>Mr. Frolick next day appeared among the
gentlemen at their weekly meeting on the bowling-green, and now were seen the effects of a London
education.  His dress, his language, his ideas, were
all new, and he did not much endeavour to conceal
his comtempt of every thing that differed from the
opinions, or practice, of the modish world.  He
showed us the deformity of our skirts and sleeves,
informed us where hats of the proper size were to
be sold, and recommended to us the reformation of
a thousand absurdities in our clothes, our cookery,
and our conversation.  When any of his phrases
were unintelligible, he could not suppress the joy
of confessed superiority, but frequently delayed the
explanation, that he might enjoy his triumph over
our barbarity.
</p>

<p>When he is pleased to entertain us with a story,
he takes care to crowd into it names of streets,
squares, and buildings, with which he knows we are
unacquainted.  The favourite topicks of his discourse
are the pranks of drunkards, and the tricks put upon
country gentlemen by porters and link-boys.  When
he is with ladies, he tells them of the innumerable
pleasures to which he can introduce them; but never
fails to hint how much they will be deficient, at their
first arrival, in the knowledge of the town.  What it
is <hi rend="italic">to know the town</hi>, he has not indeed hitherto
informed us, though there is no phrase so frequent
in his mouth, nor any science which he appears

<pb n="41"/>

to think of so great a value, or so difficult
attainment.
</p>

<p>But my curiosity has been most engaged by the
recital of his own adventures and achievements.  I
have heard of the union of various characters in
single persons, but never met with such a constellation
of great qualities as this man's narrative affords.
</p>

<p>Whatever has distinguished the hero; whatever
has elevated the wit; whatever has endeared the
the lover, are all concentered in Mr. Frolick, whose
life has, for seven years, been a regular interchange
of intrigues, dangers, and waggeries, and who has
distinguished himself in every character that can be
feared, envied, or admired.
</p>

<p>I question whether all the officers of the royal navy
can bring together, from all their journals, a collection
of so many wonderful escapes as this man has
known upon the Thames, on which he has been a
thousand and a thousand times on the point of
perishing, sometimes by the terrours of foolish women
in the same boat, sometimes by his own acknowledged
imprudence in passing the river in the dark,
and sometimes by shooting the bridge under which
he has rencountered mountainous waves, and dreadful
cataracts.
</p>

<p>Nor less has been his temerity by land, nor fewer
his hazards.  He has reeled with giddiness on the top
of the monument; he has crossed the street amidst
the rush of coaches; he has been surrounded by
robbers without numbers; he has headed parties at
the playhouse; he has scaled the windows of every

<pb n="42"/>

toast, of whatever condition; he has been hunted for
whole winters by his rivals; he has slept upon bulks,
he has cut chairs, he has bilked coachmen; he has
rescued his friends from the bailiffs, has knocked
down the constable, has bullied the justice, and
performed many other exploits, that have filled the town
with wonder and with merriment.
</p>

<p>But yet greater is the fame of his understanding
than his bravery; for he informs us, that he is, at
London, the established arbitrator of all points of
honour, and the decisive judge of all performances
of genius; that no musical performer is in reputation
till the opinion of Frolick has ratified his pretensions;
that the theatres suspend their sentence till he
begins the clap or hiss, in which all are proud to
concur; that no publick entertainment has failed or
succeeded, but because he opposed or favoured it;
that all controversies at the gaming-table are referred
to his determination; that he adjusts the ceremonial
at every assembly, and prescribes every fashion of
pleasure or of dress.
</p>

<p>With every man whose name occurs in the papers
of the day, he is intimately acquainted; and there
are very few posts either in the state or army, of
which he has not more or less influenced the disposal.
</p>

<p>He has been very frequently consulted both upon
war and peace; but the time is not yet come when
the nation shall know how much it is indebted to
the genius of Frolick.
</p>

<p>Yet, notwithstanding all these declarations, I cannot
hitherto persuade myself to see Mr. Frolick has

<pb n="43"/>

more wit, or knowledge, or courage, than the rest of
mankind, or that any uncommon enlargement of his
faculties has happened in the time of his absence.
</p>

<p>For when he talks on subjects known to the rest
of the company, he has no advantage over us, but
by catches of interruption, briskness of interrogation,
and pertness of contempt; and therefore if he
has stunned the world with his name, and gained a
place in the first ranks of humanity, I cannot but
conclude, that either a little understanding confers
eminence at London, or that Mr. Frolick thinks us
unworthy of the exertion of his powers, or that his
faculties are benumbed by rural stupidity, as the
magnetic needle loses its animation in the polar
climes.
</p>

<p>I would not, however, like many hasty philosophers,
search after the cause till I am certain of
the effect; and therefore I desire to be informed,
whether you have yet heard the great name of
Mr. Frolick.  If he is celebrated by other tongues
than his own, I shall willingly propagate his praise;
but if he has swelled among us with empty boasts,
and honours conferred only by himself, I shall treat
him with rustick sincerity, and drive him as an
impostor from this part of the kingdom to some region
of more credulity.

<opener>TO THE RAMBLER.
<salute>SIR,
</salute>
</opener>

<p>I AM a young woman of very large fortune, which,
if my parents would have been persuaded to
comply with the rules and customs of the polite
part of mankind, might long since have raised me
to the highest honours of the female world; but so
strangely have they hitherto contrived to waste my
life, that I am now on the borders of twenty, without
having ever danced but at our monthly assembly,
or been toasted but among a few gentlemen of
the neighbourhood, or seen in any company in which
it was worth a wish to be distinguished.
</p>

<p>My father having impaired his patrimony in
soliciting a place at court, at last grew wise enough
to cease his pursuit; and to repair the consequences
of expensive attendance and negligence of his affairs,
married a lady much older than himself, who had
lived in the fashionable world till she was considered

<pb n="45"/>

as an incumbrance upon parties of pleasure, and as
I can collect from incidental informations, retired
from gay assemblies just time enough to escape the
mortifications of universal neglect.
</p>

<p>She was, however, still rich, and not yet wrinkled;
my father was too distressfully embarrassed to think
much on any thing but the means of extrication,
and though it is not likely that he wanted the delicacy
which polite conversation will always produce
in understandings not remarkably defective, yet he
was contented with a match, by which he might be
set free from inconveniences, that would have
destroyed all the pleasures of imagination, and
taken from softness and beauty the power of
delighting.
</p>

<p>As they were both somewhat disgusted with their
treatment in the world, and married, though without
any dislike of each other, yet principally for the
sake of setting themselves free from dependence on
caprice or fashion, they soon retired into the country,
and devoted their lives to rural business and
diversions.
</p>

<p>They had not much reason to regret the change
of their situation; for their vanity, which had so
long been tormented by neglect and disappointment,
was here gratified with every honour that
could be paid them.  Their long familiarity with
publick life made them the oracles of all those who
aspired to intelligence, or politeness.  My father
dictated politicks, my mother prescribed the mode,
and it was sufficient to entitle my family to some

<pb n="46"/>

consideration, that they were known to visit at
Mrs. Courtly's.
</p>

<p>In this state they were, to speak in the style of
novelists, made happy by the birth of your correspondent.
My parents had no other child, I was therefore
not brow-beaten by a saucy brother, or lost in
a multitude of coheiresses, whose fortunes being
equal, would probably have conferred equal merit,
and procured equal regard; and as my mother was
now old, my understanding and my person had fair
play, my inquiries were not checked, my advances
towards importance were not repressed, and I was
soon suffered to tell my own opinions, and early
accustomed to hear my own praises.
</p>

<p>By these accidental advantages I was much exalted
above the young ladies with whom I conversed, and
was treated by them with great deference.  I saw
none who did not seem to confess my superiority,
and to be held in awe by the splendour of my appearance;
for the fondness of my father made him
pleased to see me dressed, and my mother had no
vanity nor expenses to hinder her from concurring
with his inclination.
</p>

<p>Thus, Mr. Rambler, I lived without much desire
after any thing beyond the circle of our visits; and
here I should have quietly continued to portion out
my time among my books, and my needle, and my
company, had not my curiosity been every moment
excited by the conversation of my parents, who,
whenever they sit down to familiar prattle, and
endeavour the entertainment of each other, immedi-
<pb n="47"/>

ately transport themselves to London, and relate
some adventure in a hackney-coach, some frolick at
a masquerade, some conversation in the park, or
some quarrel at an assembly, display the magnificence
of a birth-night, relate the conquests of maids
of honour, or give a history of diversions, shows, and
entertainments, which I had never known but from
their accounts.
</p>

<p>I am so well versed in the history of the gay world,
that I can relate, with great punctuality, the lives
of all the last race of wits and beauties; can enumerate
with exact chronology, the whole succession of
celebrated singers, musicians, tragedians, comedians,
and harlequins; can tell to the last twenty years all
the changes of fashions; and am, indeed, a complete
antiquary with respect to head-dresses, dances, and
operas.
</p>

<p>You will easily imagine, Mr. Rambler, that I could
not hear these narratives, for sixteen years together,
without suffering some impression, and wishing myself
nearer to those places where every hour brings
some new pleasure, and life is diversified with an
unexhausted succession of felicity.
</p>

<p>I indeed often asked my mother why she left a
place which she recollected with so much delight, and
why she did not visit London once a year, like some
other ladies, and initiate me in the world by showing
me its amusements, its grandeur, and its variety.
</p>

<p>But she always told me that the days which she
had seen were such as will never come again; that
all diversion is now degenerated, that the conver-
<pb n="48"/>

sation of the present age is insipid, that their
fashions are unbecoming, their customs absurd, and
their morals corrupt; that there is no ray left of the
genius which enlightened the times that she remembers;
that no one who had seen, or heard, the
ancient performers, would be able to bear the
bunglers of this despicable age: and that there is now
neither politeness, nor pleasure, nor virtue, in the
world.  She therefore assures me that she consults
my happiness by keeping me at home, for I should
now find nothing but vexation and disgust, and she
should be ashamed to see me pleased with such
fopperies and trifles, as take up the thoughts of the
present set of young people.
</p>

<p>With this answer I was kept quiet for several
years, and thought it no great inconvenience to be
confined to the country, till last summer a young
gentleman and his sister came down to pass a few
months with one of our neighbours.  They had generally
no great regard for the country ladies, but
distinguished me by a particular complaisance, and,
as we grew intimate, gave me such a detail of the
elegance, the splendour, the mirth, the happiness of
the town, that I am resolved to be no longer buried
in ignorance and obscurity, but to share with other
wits the joy of being admired, and divide with
other beauties the empire of the world.
</p>

<p>I do not find, Mr. Rambler, upon a deliberate and
impartial comparison, that I am excelled by Belinda
in beauty, in wit, in judgment, in knowledge, or in
any thing, but a kind of gay, lively familiarity, by

<pb n="49"/>

which she mingles with strangers as with persons
long acquainted, and which enables her to display
her powers without any obstruction, hesitation, or
confusion.  Yet she can relate a thousand civilities
paid to her in publick, can produce, from a hundred
lovers, letters filled with praises, protestations, ecstacies,
and despair; has been handed by dukes to her
chair; has been the occasion of innumerable quarrels;
has paid twenty visits in an afternoon; been
invited to six balls in an evening, and been forced
to retire to lodgings in the country from the importunity
of courtship, and the fatigue of pleasure.
</p>

<p>I tell you, Mr. Rambler, I will stay here no
longer.  I have at last prevailed upon my mother to
send me to town, and shall set out in three weeks
on the grand expedition.  I intend to live in publick,
and to crowd into the winter every pleasure which
money can purchase, and every honour which beauty
can obtain.
</p>

<p>But this tedious interval how shall I endure? Cannot
you alleviate the misery of delay by some
pleasing description of the entertainments of the
town? I can read, I can talk, I can think of nothing
else; and if you will not sooth my impatience,
heighten my ideas, and animate my hopes, you may
write for those who have more leisure, but are not
to expect any longer the honour of being read by
those eyes which are now intent only on conquest
and destruction.

</epigraph>


<p>IT has been remarked, perhaps, by every writer
who has left behind him observations upon life,
that no man is pleased with his present state; which
proves equally unsatisfactory, says Horace, whether
fallen upon by chance, or chosen with deliberation;
we are always disgusted with some circumstance or
other of our situation, and imagine the condition of
others more abundant in blessings, or less exposed
to calamities.
</p>

<p>This universal discontent has been generally mentioned
with great severity of censure, as unreasonable
in itself, since of two, equally envious of each
other, both cannot have the larger share of happiness,
and as tending to darken life with unnecessary
gloom, by withdrawing our minds from the contemplation
and enjoyment of that happiness which
our state affords us, and fixing our attention upon
foreign objects, which we only behold to depress
ourselves, and increase our misery by injurious
comparisons.

<pb n="51"/>

</p>

<p>When this opinion of the felicity of others
predominates in the heart, so as to excite resolutions
of obtaining, at whatever price, the condition to
which such transcendent privileges are supposed to
be annexed; when it bursts into action, and produces
fraud, violence, and injustice, it is to be pursued
with all the rigour of legal punishments.  But
while operating only upon the thoughts it disturbs
none but him who has happened to admit it, and,
however it may interrupt content, makes no attack
on piety or virtue, I cannot think it so far criminal
or ridiculous, but that it may deserve some pity,
and admit some excuse.
</p>

<p>That all are equally happy, or miserable, I suppose
none is sufficiently enthusiastical to maintain;
because though we cannot judge of the condition of
others, yet every man has found frequent vicissitudes
in his own state, and must therefore be convinced
that life is susceptible of more or less felicity.
What then shall forbid us to endeavour the alteration
of that which is capable of being improved,
and to grasp at augmentations of good, when we
know it possible to be increased, and believe that
any particular change of situation will increase it?
</p>

<p>If he that finds himself uneasy may reasonably
make efforts to rid himself from vexation, all mankind
have a sufficient plea for some degree of restlessness,
and the fault seems to be little more than
too much temerity of conclusion, in favour of something
not yet experienced, and too much readiness
to believe, that the misery which our own passions

<pb n="52"/>

and appetites produce, is brought upon us by accidental
causes, and external efficients.
</p>

<p>It is, indeed, frequently discovered by us, that
we complained too hastily of peculiar hardships,
and imagined ourselves distinguished by embarrassments,
in which other classes of men are equally entangled.
We often change a lighter for a greater
evil, and wish ourselves restored again to the state
from which we thought it desirable to be delivered.
But this knowledge, though it is easily gained by
the trial, is not always attainable any other way;
and that errour cannot justly be reproached, which
reason could not obviate, nor prudence avoid.
</p>

<p>To take a view at once distinct and comprehensive
of human life, with all its intricacies of combination,
and varieties of connexion, is beyond the
power of mortal intelligences.  Of the state with
which practice has not acquainted us we snatch a
glimpse, we discern a point, and regulate the rest by
passion, and by fancy.  In this inquiry every favourite
prejudice, every innate desire, is busy to deceive us.
We are unhappy, at least less happy than our nature
seems to admit; we necessarily desire the melioration
of our lot; what we desire we very reasonably
seek, and what we seek we are naturally eager to
believe that we have found.  Our confidence is often
disappointed, but our reason is not convinced, and
there is no man who does not hope for something
which he has not, though perhaps his wishes lie
unactive, because he foresees the difficulty of
attainment.  As among the numerous students of Her-
<pb n="53"/>

metick philosophy, not one appears to have desisted
from the task of transmutation, from conviction of
its impossibility, but from weariness of toil, or
impatience of delay, a broken body, or exhausted
fortune.
</p>

<p>Irresolution and mutability are often the faults
of men, whose views are wide, and whose imagination
is vigorous and excursive, because they cannot
confine their thoughts within their own boundaries
of action, but are continually ranging over all the
scenes of human existence, and consequently are
often apt to conceive that they fall upon new regions
of pleasure, and start new possibilities of
happiness.  Thus they are busied with a perpetual succession
of schemes, and pass their lives in alternate
elation and sorrow, for want of that calm and immovable
acquiescence in their condition, by which
men of slower understandings are fixed for ever to
a certain point, or led on in the plain beaten track,
which their fathers and grandsires have trod before
them.
</p>

<p>Of two conditions of life equally inviting to the
prospect, that will always have the disadvantage
which we have already tried; because the evils which
we have felt we cannot extenuate; and though we
have, perhaps from nature, the power as well of
aggravating the calamity which we fear, as of heightening
the blessing we expect, yet in those meditations
which we indulge by choice, and which are not
forced upon the mind by necessity, we have always
the art of fixing our regard upon the more pleasing

<pb n="54"/>

images, and suffer hope to dispose the lights by
which we look upon futurity.
</p>

<p>The good and ill of different modes of life are
sometimes so equally opposed, that perhaps no man
ever yet made his choice between them upon a full
conviction, and adequate knowledge; and therefore
fluctuation of will is not more wonderful, when they
are proposed to the election, than oscillations of a
beam charged with equal weights.  The mind no
sooner imagines itself determined by some prevalent
advantage, than some convenience of equal weight
is discovered on the other side, and the resolutions,
which are suggested by the nicest examination, are
often repented as soon as they are taken.
</p>

<p>Eumenes, a young man of great abilities, inherited
a large estate from a father, long eminent in
conspicuous employments.  His father, harassed with
competitions, and perplexed with multiplicity of
business, recommended the quiet of a private station
with so much force, that Eumenes for some
years resisted every motion of ambitious wishes;
but being once provoked by the sight of oppression,
which he could not redress, he began to think it the
duty of an honest man to enable himself to protect
others, and gradually felt a desire of greatness,
excited by a thousand projects of advantage to his
country.  His fortune placed him in the senate, his
knowledge and eloquence advanced him at court,
and he possessed that authority and influence
which he had resolved to exert for the happiness
of mankind.

<pb n="55"/>

</p>

<p>He now became acquainted with greatness, and
was in a short time convinced, that in proportion as
the power of doing well is enlarged, the temptations
to do ill are multiplied and enforced.  He felt himself
every moment in danger of being either seduced
or driven from his honest purposes.  Sometimes a
friend was to be gratified, and sometimes a rival to
be crushed, by means which his conscience could
not approve.  Sometimes he was forced to comply
with the prejudices of the publick, and sometimes
with the schemes of the ministry.  He was by degrees
wearied with perpetual struggles to unite policy
and virtue, and went back to retirement as the
shelter of innocence, persuaded that he could only
hope to benefit mankind by a blameless example of
private virtue.  Here he spent some years in tranquillity
and beneficence; but finding that corruption
increased, and false opinions in government prevailed,
he thought himself again summoned to posts
of publick trust, from which new evidence of his
own weakness again determined him to retire.
</p>

<p>Thus men may be made inconstant by virtue and
by vice, by too much or too little thought; yet
inconstancy, however dignified by its motives, is
always to be avoided, because life allows us but a
small time for inquiry and experiment, and he that
steadily endeavours at excellence, in whatever
employment, will more benefit mankind than he that
hesitates in chusing his part till he is called to the
performance.  The traveller that resolutely follows
a rough and winding path, will sooner reach the

<pb n="56"/>

end of his journey, than he that is always changing
his direction, and wastes the hours of day-light in
looking for smoother ground and shorter passages.

</p>

<bibl>SALL. Bell. Cat. 20.
</bibl>

<p>To live in friendship is to have the same desires and the same aversions.
</p>

</epigraph>

<p>WHEN Socrates was building himself a house
at Athens, being asked by one that observed
the littleness of the design, why a man so eminent
would not have an abode more suitable to his dignity?
he replied, that he should think himself sufficiently
accommodated, if he could see that narrow
habitation filled with real friends<ref target="JohRamb.3">[r]</ref>.  Such was the
opinion of this great master of human life, concerning
the infrequency of such an union of minds as
might deserve the name of friendship, that among
the multitudes whom vanity or curiosity, civilty or
veneration, crowded about him, he did not expect,
that very spacious apartments would be necessary
to contain all that should regard him with sincere
kindness, or adhere to him with steady fidelity.
</p>

<note id="JohRamb.3"><seg type="note-symbol">[r]</seg> <p>This passage is almost a literal translation
from Ph&aelig;drus, lib. iii.  9.</p><p lang="lat" ><hi rend="italic">Vulgare
amici nomen, sed rara est fides.  Quum parvas &aelig;des sibi fundasset
Socrates (Cujus non fugio mortem, si famam adsequar, Et cedo
invidi&aelig;, dum modo absolvar cinis.)  E populo sic, nescio quis, ut
fieri solet:  Qu&aelig;so tam angustam, talis vir, ponis domum?  Utinam,
inquit, veris hanc amicis impleam.  </hi></p></note>

<pb n="57"/>

<p>So many qualities are indeed requisite to the possibility
of friendship, and so many accidents must
concur to its rise and continuance, that the greatest
part of mankind content themselves without it,
and supply its place as they can, with interest and
dependance.
</p>

<p>Multitudes are unqualified for a constant and
warm reciprocation of benevolence, as they are
incapacitated for any other elevated excellence, by
perpetual attention to their interest, and unresisting
subjection to their passions.  Long habits may
superinduce inability to deny any desire, or repress,
by superior motives, the importunities of any immediate
gratification, and an inveterate selfishness
will imagine all advantages diminished in proportion
as they are communicated.
</p>

<p>But not only this hateful and confirmed corruption,
but many varieties of disposition, not inconsistent
with common degrees of virtue, may exclude
friendship from the heart.  Some ardent enough in
their benevolence, and defective neither in officiousness
nor liberality, are mutable and uncertain, soon
attracted by new objects, disgusted without offence,
and alienated without enmity.  Others are soft and
flexible, easily influenced by reports or whispers,
ready to catch alarms from every dubious circumstance,
and to listen to every suspicion which envy
and flattery shall suggest, to follow the opinion of
every confident adviser, and move by the impulse
of the last breath.  Some are impatient of contradiction,
more willing to go wrong by their own judg-
<pb n="58"/>

ment, than to be indebted for a better or a safer way
to the sagacity of another, inclined to consider
counsel as insult, and inquiry as want of confidence,
and to confer their regard on no other terms than
unreserved submission, and implicit compliance.
Some are dark and involved, equally careful to conceal
good and bad purposes; and pleased with producing
effects by invisible means, and shewing their
design only in its execution.  Others are universally
communicative, alike open to every eye, and equally
profuse of their own secrets and those of others,
without the necessary vigilance of caution, or the
honest arts of prudent integrity, ready to accuse
without malice, and to betray without treachery.
Any of these may be useful to the community, and
pass through the world with the reputation of good
purposes and uncorrupted morals, but they are unfit
for close and tender intimacies.  He cannot properly
be chosen for a friend, whose kindness is exhaled
by its own warmth, or frozen by the first blast of
slander; he cannot be a useful counsellor who will
hear no opinion but his own; he will not much invite
confidence whose principal maxim is to suspect;
nor can the candour and frankness of that man be
much esteemed, who spreads his arms to humankind,
and makes every man, without distinction, a
denizen of his bosom.
</p>

<p>That friendship may be at once fond and lasting,
there must not only be equal virtue on each part,
but virtue of the same kind; not only the same end
must be proposed, but the same means must be ap-
<pb n="59"/>

proved by both.  We are often, by superficial
accomplishments and accidental endearments, induced to
love those whom we cannot esteem; we are sometimes,
by great abilities, and incontestable evidences
of virtue, compelled to esteem those whom we cannot
love.  But friendship, compounded of esteem
and love, derives from one its tenderness, and its
permanence from the other; and therefore requires
not only that its candidates should gain the judgment,
but that they should attract the affections;
that they should not only be firm in the day of distress,
but gay in the hour of jollity; not only useful
in exigencies, but pleasing in familiar life; their
presence should give cheerfulness as well as courage,
ana dispel alike the gloom of fear and of
melancholy.
</p>

<p>To this mutual complacency is generally requisite
an uniformity of opinions, at least of those active
and conspicuous principles which discriminate
parties in government, and sects in religion, and
which every day operate more or less on the common
business of life.  For though great tenderness
has, perhaps, been sometimes known to continue
between men eminent in contrary factions; yet
such friends are to be shewn rather as prodigies than
examples, and it is no more proper to regulate our
conduct by such instances, than to leap a precipice,
because some have fallen from it and escaped with
life.
</p>

<p>It cannot but be extremely difficult to preserve
private kindness in the midst of publick opposition,

<pb n="60"/>

in which will necessarily be involved a thousand
incidents, extending their influence to conversation
and privacy.  Men engaged, by moral or religious
motives, in contrary parties, will generally look
with different eyes upon every man, and decide
almost every question upon different principles.
When such occasions of dispute happen, to comply
is to betray our cause, and to maintain friendship
by ceasing to deserve it; to be silent is to lose the
happiness and dignity of independence, to live in
perpetual constraint, and to desert, if not to betray:
and who shall determine which of two friends shall
yield, where neither believes himself mistaken,
and both confess the importance of the question?
What then remains but contradiction and debate?
and from those what can be expected, but acrimony
and vehemence, the insolence of triumph, the vexation
of defeat, and, in time, a weariness of contest,
and an extinction of benevolence? Exchange of
endearments and intercourse of civility may continue,
indeed, as boughs may for a while be verdant, when
the root is wounded; but the poision of discord is
infused, and though the countenance may preserve
its smile, the heart is hardening and contracting.
</p>

<p>That man will not be long agreeable, whom we see
only in times of seriousness and severity; and therefore
to maintain the softness and serenity of benevolence,
it is necessary that friends partake each
other's pleasures as well as cares, and be led to the
same diversions by similitude of taste.  This is, however,
not to be considered as equally indispensable

<pb n="61"/>

with conformity of principles, because any man
may honestly, according to the precepts of Horace,
resign the gratifications of taste to the humour of
another, and friendship may well deserve the sacrifice
of pleasure, though not of conscience.
</p>

<p>It was once confessed to me, by a painter, that
no professor of his art ever loved another.  This declaration
is so far justified by the knowledge of life,
as to damp the hopes of warm and constant friendship,
between men whom their studies have made
competitors, and whom every favourer and every
censurer are hourly inciting against each other.
The utmost expectation that experience can warrant,
is, that they should forbear open hostilities and
secret machinations, and when the whole fraternity
is attacked, be able to unite against a common
foe.  Some, however, though few, may perhaps be
found, in whom emulation has not been able to
overpower generosity, who are distinguished from
lower beings by nobler motives than the love of
fame, and can preserve the sacred flame of friendship
from the gusts of pride, and the rubbish of
interest.
</p>

<p>Friendship is seldon lasting but between equals,
or where the superiority on one side is reduced by
some equivalent advantage on the other.  Benefits
which cannot be repaid, and obligations which cannot
be discharged, are not commonly found to increase
afFection; they excite gratitude indeed, and
heighten veneration; but commonly take away that
easy freedom and familiarity of intercourse, with-
<pb n="62"/>

out which, though there may be fidelity, and zeal,
and admiration, there cannot be friendship.  Thus
imperfect are all earthly blessings; the great effect of
friendship is beneficence, yet by the first act of uncommon
kindness it is endangered, like plants that
bear their fruit and die.  Yet this consideration
ought not to restrain bounty, or repress compassion;
for duty is to be preferred before convenience,
and he that loses part of the pleasures of friendship
by his generosity, gains in its place the gratulation
of his conscience.

<p>O BIDAH, the son of Abensina, left the caravansera
early in the morning, and pursued his
journey through the plains of Indostan.  He was
fresh and vigorous with rest; he was animated with
hope; he was incited by desire; he walked swiftly
forward over the valleys, and saw the hills gradually
rising before him.  As he passed along, his ears were
delighted with the morning song of the bird of
paradise, he was fanned by the last flutters of the
sinking breeze, and sprinkled with dew by groves
of spices; he sometimes contemplated the towering
height of the oak, monarch of the hills; and
sometimes caught the gentle fragrance of the prim-
<pb n="63"/>

rose, eldest daughter of the spring; all his senses
were gratified, and all care was banished from his
heart.
</p>

<p>Thus he went on till the sun approached his
meridian, and the increasing heat preyed upon his
strength; he then looked round about him for some
more commodious path.  He saw, on his right hand,
a grove that seemed to wave its shades as a sign of
invitation; he entered it, and found the coolness
and verdure irresistibly pleasant.  He did not, however,
forget whither he was travelling, but found a
narrow way bordered with flowers, which appeard
to have the same direction with the main road, and
was pleased that, by this happy experiment, he
had found means to unite pleasure with business,
and to gain the rewards of diligence without suffering
its fatigues.  He, therefore, still continued to
walk for a time, without the least remission of his
ardour, except that he was sometimes tempted to
stop by the musick of the birds whom the heat had
assembled in the shade; and sometimes amused
himself with plucking the flowers that covered the
banks on either side, or the fruits that hung upon
the branches.  At last the green path began to decline
from its first tendency, and to wind among
hills and thickets, cooled with fountains and murmuring
with waterfalls.  Here Obidah paused for a
time, and began to consider whether it were longer
safe to forsake the known and common track; but
remembering that the heat was now in its greatest
violence, and that the plain was dusty and uneven,

<pb n="64"/>

he resolved to pursue the new path, which he supposed
only to make a few meanders, in compliance
with the varieties of the ground, and to end at last
in the common road.
</p>

<p>Having thus calmed his solicitude, he renewed
his pace, though he suspected that he was not
gaining ground.  This uneasiness of his mind inclined
him to lay hold on every new object, and
give way to every sensation that might sooth or
divert him.  He listened to every echo, he mounted
every hill for a fresh prospect, he turned aside
to every cascade, and pleased himself with tracing
the course of a gentle river that rolled among the
trees, and watered a large region with innumerable
circumvolutions.  In these amusements the hours
passed away uncounted, his deviations had perplexed
his memory, and he knew not towards what point
to travel.  He stood pensive and confused, afraid to
go forward lest he should go wrong, yet conscious
that the time of loitering was now past.  While he
was thus tortured with uncertainty, the sky was
overspread with clouds, the day vanished from
before him, and a sudden tempest gathered round
his head.  He was now roused by his danger to a quick
and painful remembrance of his folly; he now saw
how happiness is lost when ease is consulted; he
lamented the unmanly impatience that prompted
him to seek shelter in the grove, and despised the
petty curiosity that led him on from trifle to trifle
While he was thus reflecting, the air grew blacker;
and a clap of thunder broke his meditation

<pb n="65"/>

</p>

<p>He now resolved to do what remained yet in his
power, to tread back the ground which he had
passed, and try to find some issue where the wood
might open into the plain.  He prostrated himself on
the ground, and commended his life to the Lord of
nature.  He rose with confidence and tranquillity,
and pressed on with his sabre in his hand, for the
beasts of the desert were in motion, and on every
hand were heard the mingled howls of rage and
fear, and ravage and expiration; all the horrours of
darkness and solitude surrounded him; the winds
roared in the woods, and the torrents tumbled from
the hills,

<p>Thus forlorn and distressed, he wandered through
the wild, without knowing whither he was going,
or whether he was every moment drawing nearer to
safety or to destruction.  At length not fear but
labour began to overcome him; his breath grew
short, and his knees trembled, he was on the point
of lying down in resignation to his fate, when he
beheld through the brambles the glimmer of a taper.
He advanced towards the light, and finding that
it proceeded from the cottage of a hermit, he called
humbly at the door, and obtained admission.  The
old man set before him such provisions as he had

<pb n="66"/>

collected for himself, on which Obidah fed with
eagerness and gratitude.
</p>

<p>When the repast was over, "Tell me," said the
hermit, "by what chance thou hast been brought
hither; I have been now twenty years an inhabitant
of the wilderness, in which I never saw a man
before.  "Obidah then related the occurences of his
journey, without any concealment or palliation.
</p>

<p>"Son," said the hermit, "let the errours and follies,
the dangers and escape of this day, sink deep
into thy heart.  Remember, my son, that human life
is the journey of a day.  We rise in the morning of
youth, full of vigour and full of expectation; we set
forward with spirit and hope, with gaiety and with
diligence, and travel on a while in the straight road
of piety towards the mansions of rest.  In a short
time we remit our fervour, and endeavour to find
some mitigation of our duty, and some more easy
means of obtaining the same end.  We then relax our
vigour, and resolve no longer to be terrified with
crimes at a distance, but rely upon our own constancy,
and venture to approach what we resolve
never to touch.  We thus enter the bowers of ease,
and repose in the shades of security.  Here the heart
softens and vigilance subsides; we are then willing
to inquire whether another advance cannot be made,
and whether we may not, at least, turn our eyes upon
the gardens of pleasure.  We approach them with
scruple and hesitation; we enter them, but enter
timorous and trembling, and always hope to pass
through them without losing the road of virtue,

<pb n="67"/>

which we, for a while, keep in our sight, and to
which we propose to return.  But temptation succeeds
temptation, and one compliance prepares us
for another; we in time lose the happiness of innocence,
and solace our disquiet with sensual gratifications.
By degrees we let fall the remembrance
of our original intention, and quit the only adequate
object of rational desire.  We entangle ourselves in
business, immerge ourselves in luxury, and rove
through the labyrinths of inconstancy, till the darkness
of old age begins to invade us, and disease and
anxiety obstruct our way.  We then look back upon
our lives with horrour, with sorrow, with repentance;
and wish, but too often vainly wish, that we
had not forsaken the ways of virtue.  Happy are they,
my son, who shall learn from thy example not to
despair, but shall remember, that though the day is
past, and their strength is wasted, there yet remains
one effort to be made; that reformation is never
hopeless, nor sincere endeavours ever unassisted;
that the wanderer may at length return after all his
errours, and that he who implores strength and
courage from above, shall find danger and difficulty
give way before him.  Go now, my son, to thy repose,
commit thyself to the care of Omnipotence,
and when the morning calls again to toil, begin anew
thy journey and thy life."

</epigraph>

<p>THE folly of human wishes and pursuits has always
been a standing subject of mirth and declamation,
and has been ridiculed and lamented from
age to age; till perhaps the fruitless repetition of
complaints and censures, may be justly numbered
among the subjects of censure and complaint.
</p>

<p>Some of these instructors of mankind have not
contented themselves with checking the overflows
of passion, and lopping the exuberance of desire,
but have attempted to destroy the root as well as
the branches; and not only to confine the mind
within bounds, but to smooth it for ever by a dead
calm.  They have employed their reason and eloquence
to persuade us, that nothing is worth the
wish of a wise man, have represented all earthly
good and evil as indifferent, and counted among
vulgar errours the dread of pain, and the love of life.
</p>

<p>It is almost always the unhappiness of a victorious
disputant, to destroy his own authority by
claiming too many consequences, or diffusing his
proposition to an indefensible extent.  When we
have heated our zeal in a cause, and elated our
confidence with success, we are naturally inclined to

<pb n="69"/>

pursue the same train of reasoning, to establish some
collateral truth, to remove some adjacent difficulty,
and to take in the whole comprehension of our system.
As a prince, in the ardour of acquisition, is
willing to secure his first conquest by the addition
of another, add fortress to fortress, and city to city,
till despair and opportunity turn his enemies upon
him, and he loses in a moment the glory of a reign.
</p>

<p>The philosophers having found an easy victory
over those desires which we produce in ourselves,
and which terminate in some imaginary state of
happiness unknown and unattainable, proceeded to
make further inroads upon the heart, and attacked
at last our senses and our instincts.  They continued
to war upon nature with arms, by which only folly
could be conquered; they therefore lost the trophies
of their former combats, and were considered no
longer with reverence or regard.
</p>

<p>Yet it cannot be with justice denied, that these
men have been very useful monitors, and have left
many proofs of strong reason, deep penetration, and
accurate attention to the affairs of life, which it is
now our business to separate from the foam of a
boiling imagination, and to apply judiciously to our
own use.  They have shewn that most of the conditions
of life, which raise the envy of the timorous,
and rouse the ambition of the daring, are empty
shows of felicity,which, when they become familiar,
lose their power of delighting; and that the most
prosperous and exalted have very few advantages
over a meaner and more obscure fortune, when

<pb n="70"/>

their dangers and solicitudes are balanced against
their equipage, their banquets, and their palaces.
</p>

<p>It is natural for every man uninstructed to murmur
at his condition, because, in the general infelicity
of life, he feels his own miseries, without
knowing that they are common to all the rest of
the species; and therefore, though he will not be
less sensible of pain by being told that others are
equally tormented, he will at least be freed from
the temptation of seeking, by perpetual changes,
that ease which is no where to be found; and though
his disease still continues, he escapes the hazard of
exasperating it by remedies.
</p>

<p>The gratifications which affluence of wealth, extent
of power, and eminence of reputation confer
must be always, by their own nature, confined to
a very small number; and the life of the greater
part of mankind must be lost in empty wishes and
painful comparisons, were not the balm of philosophy
shed upon us, and our discontent at the appearances
of an unequal distribution soothed and
appeased.
</p>

<p>It seemed, perhaps, below the dignity of the
great masters of moral learning, to descend to familiar
life, and caution mankind against that petty
ambition which is known among us by the name of
Vanity; which yet had been an undertaking not unworthy
of the longest beard, and most solemn austerity.
For though the passions of little minds,
acting in low stations, do not fill the world with
bloodshed and devastations, or mark, by great

<pb n="71"/>

events, the periods of time, yet they torture the
breast on which they seize, infest those that are
placed within the reach of their influence, destroy
private quiet and private virtue, and undermine
insensibly the happiness of the world.
</p>

<p>The desire of excellence is laudable, but is very
frequently ill directed.  We fall, by chance, into
some class of mankind, and, without consulting
nature or wisdom, resolve to gain their regard by
those qualities which they happen to esteem.  I once
knew a man remarkably dimsighted, who, by conversing
much with country gentlemen, found himself
irresistibly determined to sylvan honours.  His
great ambition was to shoot flying, and he therefore
spent whole days in the woods pursuing game;
which, before he was near enough to see them, his
approach frighted away.
</p>

<p>When it happens that the desire tends to objects
which produce no competition, it may be overlooked
with some indulgence, because, however fruitless or
absurd, it cannot have ill effects upon the morals.
But most of our enjoyments owe their value to the
peculiarity of possession, and when they are rated
at too high a value, give occasion to stratagems of
malignity, and incite opposition, hatred, and defamation.
The contest of two rural beauties for preference
and distinction, is often sufficiently keen and
rancorous to fill their breasts with all those passions,
which are generally thought the curse only of senates,
of armies, and of courts; and the rival dancers
of an obscure assembly have their partizans and abet-
<pb n="72"/>

tors, often not less exasperated against each other,
than those who are promoting the interests of rival
monarchs.
</p>

<p>It is common to consider those whom we find
infected with an unreasonable regard for trifling
accomplishments, as chargeable with all the consequences
of their folly, and as the authors of their
own unhappiness: but, perhaps, those whom we thus
scorn or detest, have more claim to tenderness than
has been yet allowed them.  Before we permit our
severity to break loose upon any fault or errour, we
ought surely to consider how much we have countenanced
or promoted it.  We see multitudes busy in
the pursuit of riches, at the expense of wisdom and
of virtue; but we see the rest of mankind approving
their conduct, and inciting their eagerness, by
paying that regard and deference to wealth, which
wisdom and virtue only can deserve.  We see women
universally jealous of the reputation of their beauty,
and frequently look with contempt on the care with
which they study their complexions, endeavour to
preserve or to supply the bloom of youth, regulate
every ornament, twist their hair into curls, and
shade their faces from the weather.  We recommend
the care of their nobler part, and tell them how
little addition is made by all their arts to the graces
of the mind.  But when was it known that female
goodness or knowledge was able to attract that
officiousness, or inspire that ardour, which beauty
produces whenever it appears? And with what hope
can we endeavour to persuade the ladies, that the

<pb n="73"/>

time spent at the toilet is lost in vanity, when they
have every moment some new conviction, that their
interest is more effectually promoted by a riband
well disposed, than by the brightest act of heroick
virtue?
</p>

<p>In every instance of vanity it will be found that
the blame ought to be shared among more than it
generally reaches; all who exalt trifles by immoderate
praise, or instigate needless emulation by
invidious incitements, are to be considered as
perverters of reason, and corrupters of the world: and
since every man is obliged to promote happiness
and virtue, he should be careful not to mislead unwary
minds, by appearing to set too high a value
upon things by which no real excellence is conferred.

<l>Exiles, the proverb says, subsist on hope,</l>
<l>Delusive hope still points to distant good,</l>
<l>To good that mocks approach.
</l>

</lg>

</epigraph>

<p>THERE is no temper so generally indulged as
hope: other passions operate by starts on particular
occasions, or in certain parts of life; but
hope begins with the first power of comparing our
actual with our possible state, and attends us through
every stage and period, always urging us forward
to new acquisitions, and holding out some distant
blessing to our view, promising us either relief from
pain, or increase of happiness.

<pb n="74"/>

</p>

<p>Hope is necessary in every condition.  The miseries
of poverty, of sickness, of captivity, would, without
this comfort, be insupportable; nor does it appear
that the happiest lot of terrestrial existence can set
us above the want of this general blessing; or that
life, when the gifts of nature and of fortune are
accumulated upon it, would not still be wretched,
were it not elevated and delighted by the expectation
of some new possession, of some enjoyment
yet behind, by which the wish shall be at last satisfied,
and the heart filled up to its utmost extent.
</p>

<p>Hope, is indeed, very fallacious, and promises
what it seldom gives; but its promises are more
valuable than the gifts of fortune, and it seldom
frustrates us without assuring us of recompensing
the delay by a greater bounty.
</p>

<p>I was musing on this strange inclination which
every man feels to deceive himself, and considering
the advantages and dangers proceeding from this gay
prospect of futurity, when, falling asleep, on a sudden
I found myself placed in a garden, of which my
sight could descry no limits.  Every scene above me
was gay and gladsome, light with sunshine, and
fragrant with perfumes; the ground was painted
with all the variety of spring, and all the choir of
nature was singing in the groves.  When I had recovered
from the first raptures, with which the confusion
of pleasure had for a time entranced me, I
began to take a particular and deliberate view of
this delightful region.  I then perceived that I had
yet higher gratifications to expect, and that, at a

<pb n="75"/>

small distance from me, there were brighter flowers,
clearer fountains, and more lofty groves, where the
birds, which I yet heard but faintly, were exerting
all the power of melody.  The trees about me were
beautiful with verdure, and fragrant with blossoms;
but I was tempted to leave them by the sight of
ripe fruits, which seemed to hang only to be plucked.
I therefore walked hastily forwards, but found, as
I proceeded, that the colours of the field faded at
my approach, the fruit fell before I reached it, the
birds flew still singing before me, and though I
pressed onward with great celerity, I was still in
sight of pleasure of which I could not yet gain the
possession, and which seemed to mock my diligence,
and to retire as I advanced.
</p>

<p>Though I was confounded with so many alternations
of joy and grief, I yet persisted to go forward,
in hopes that these fugitive delights would in time
be overtaken.  At length I saw an innumerable
multitude of every age and sex, who seemed all to
partake of some general felicity; for every cheek
was flushed with confidence, and every eye sparkled
with eagerness: yet each appeared to have some
particular and secret pleasure, and very few were
willing to communicate their intentions, or extend
their concern beyond themselves.  Most of them
seemed, by the rapidity of their motion, too busy
to gratify the curiosity of a stranger, and therefore
I was content for a while to gaze upon them, without
interrupting them with troublesome inquiries.
At last I observed one man worn with time, and

<pb n="76"/>

unable to struggle in the crowd; and, therefore, supposing
him more at leisure, I began to accost him:
but he turned from me with anger, and told me he
must not be disturbed, for the great hour of projection
was now come when Mercury should lose his
wings, and slavery should no longer dig the mine
for gold.
</p>

<p>I left him, and attempted another, whose softness
of mien, and easy movement, gave me reason to
hope for a more agreeable reception; but he told
me, with a low bow, that nothing would make him
more happy than an opportunity of serving me,
which he could not now want, for a place which he
had been twenty years soliciting would be soon
vacant.  From him I had recourse to the next, who
was departing in haste to take possession of the estate
of an uncle, who by the course of nature could
not live long.  He that followed was preparing to
dive for treasure in a new-invented bell; and another
was on the point of discovering the longitude.
</p>

<p>Being thus rejected wheresoever I applied myself
for information, I began to imagine it best to desist
from inquiry, and try what my own observation
would discover: but seeing a young man, gay and
thoughtless, I resolved upon one more experiment,
and was informed that I was in the garden of Hope,
and daughter of Desire, and that all those whom I
saw thus tumultuously hustling round me were incited
by the promises of Hope, and hastening to seize
the gifts which she held in her hand.
</p>

<p>I turned my sight upward, and saw a goddess in

<pb n="77"/>

the bloom of youth sitting on a throne: around her
lay all the gifts of fortune, and all the blessings of
life were spread abroad to view; she had a perpetual
gaiety of aspect, and every one imagined that her
smile, which was impartial and general, was directed
to himself, and triumphed in his own superiority to
others, who had conceived the same confidence from
the same mistake.
</p>

<p>I then mounted an eminence, from which I had
a more extensive view of the whole place, and could
with less perplexity consider the different conduct
of the crowds that filled it.  From this station I
observed, that the entrance into the garden of Hope
was by two gates, one of which was kept by Reason,
and the other by Fancy.  Reason was surly and
scrupulous, and seldom turned the key without
many interrogatories, and long hesitation; but
Fancy was a kind and gentle portress, she held her
gate wide open, and welcomed all equally to the district
under her superintendency; so that the passage
was crowded by all those who either feared the
examination of Reason, or had been rejected by her.
</p>

<p>From the gate of Reason there was a way to the
throne of Hope, by a craggy, slippery and winding
path, called the <hi rend="italic">Streight of Difficulty</hi>, which those
who entered with the permission of the guard
endeavoured to climb.  But though they surveyed the
way very carefully before they began to rise, and
marked out the several stages of their progress,
they commonly found unexpected obstacles, and
were obliged frequently to stop on the sudden,

<pb n="78"/>

where they imagined the way plain and even.  A
thousand intricacies embarassed them, a thousand
slips threw them back, and a thousand pitfalls impeded
their advance.  So formidable were the dangers,
and so frequent the miscarriages, that many
returned from the first attempt, and many fainted
in the midst of the way, and only a very small number
were led up to the summit of Hope, by the
hand of Fortitude.  Of these few the greater part,
when they had obtained the gift which Hope had
promised them, regretted the labour which it cost,
and felt in their success the regret of disapointment;
the rest retired with their prize, and were led
by Wisdom to the bowers of Content.
</p>

<p>Turning then towards the gate of Fancy, I could
find no way to the seat of Hope; but though she
sat full in view, and held out her gifts with an air
of invitation, which filled every heart with rapture,
the mountain was, on that side, inaccessibly steep,
but so channelled and shaded, that none perceived
the impossibility of ascending it, but each imagined
himself to have discovered a way to which the rest
were strangers.  Many expedients were indeed tried
by this industrious tribe, of whom some were making
themselves wings, which others were contriving
to actuate by the perpetual motion.  But with all their
labour, and all their artifices, they never rose above
the ground, or quickly fell back, nor ever approached
the throne of Hope, but continued still to gaze at a
distance, and laugh at the slow progress of those
whom they saw toiling in the <hi rend="italic">Streight of
Difficulty</hi>.

<pb n="79"/>

</p>

<p>Part of the favourites of Fancy, when they had
entered the garden, without making, like the rest,
an attempt to climb the mountain, turned immediately
to the vale of Idleness, a calm and undisturbed
retirement, from whence they could always
have Hope in prospect, and to which they pleased
themselves with believing that she intended speedily
to descend.  These were indeed scorned by all the
rest; but they seemed very little affected by contempt,
advice, or reproof, but were resolved to
expect at ease the favour of the goddess.
</p>

<p>Among this gay race I was wandering, and found
them ready to answer all my questions, and willing
to communicate their mirth; but turning round, I
saw two dreadful monsters entering the vale, one
of whom I knew to be Age, and the other Want.
Sport and revelling were now at an end, and an universal
shriek of affright and distress burst out and
awaked me.

<p>THE younger Pliny has very justly observed,
that of actions that deserve our attention, the
most splendid are not always the greatest.  Fame,
and wonder, and applause, are not excited but by

<pb n="80"/>

external and adventitious circumstances, often distinct
and separate from virtue and heroism.  Eminence
of station, greatness of effect, and all the
favours of fortune, must concur to place excellence in
publick view; but fortitude, diligence, and patience,
divested of their show, glide unobserved through
the crowd of life, and suffer and act, though with
the same vigour and constancy, yet without pity
and without praise.
</p>

<p>This remark may be extended to all parts of
life.  Nothing is to be estimated by its effect upon
common eyes and common ears.  A thousand miseries
make silent and invisible inroads on mankind, and
the heart feels innumerable throbs, which never break
into complaint.  Perhaps, likewise, our pleasures are
for the most part equally secret, and most are borne
up by some private satisfaction, some internal
consciousness, some latent hope, some peculiar prospect,
which they never communicate, but reserve for solitary
hours, and clandestine meditation.
</p>

<p>The main of life is, indeed, composed of small
incidents and petty occurences; of wishes for objects
not remote, and grief for dissapointments of no fatal
consequence; of insect vexations which sting us
and fly away, impertinences which buzz awhile about
us, and are heard no more; of meteorous pleasures
which dance before us and are dissipated; of compliments
which glide off the soul like other musick,
and are forgotten by him that gave, and him that
received them.
</p>

<p>Such is the general heap out of which every man

<pb n="81"/>

is to cull his own condition: for, as the chemists tell
us, that all bodies are resolvable into the same
elements, and that the boundless variety of things
arises from the different proportions of very few
ingredients; so a few pains and a few pleasures are
all the materials of human life, and of these the proportions
are partly allotted by Providence, and partly
left to the arrangement of reason and of choice.
</p>

<p>As these are well or ill disposed, man is for the
most part happy or miserable.  For very few are
involved in great events, or have their thread of life
entwisted with the chain of causes on which armies
or nations are suspended; and even those who seem
wholly busied in publick affairs, and elevated above
low cares, or trivial pleasures, pass the chief part of
their time in familiar and domestick scenes; from
these they came into publick life, to these they are
every hour recalled by passions not to be suppressed;
in these they have the reward of their toils, and to
these at last they retire.
</p>

<p>The great end of prudence is to give cheerfulness
to those hours, which splendour cannot gild, and
acclamation cannot exhilarate; those soft intervals
of unbended amusement, in which a man shrinks to
his natural dimensions, and throws aside the ornaments
or disguises, which he feels in privacy to be
useless incumbrances, and to lose all effect when
they became familiar.  To be happy at home is the
ultimate result of all ambition, the end to which
every enterprise and labour tends, and of which every
desire prompts the prosecution.

<pb n="82"/>

</p>

<p>It is, indeed, at home that every man must be
known by those who would make a just estimate
either of his virtue or felicity; for smiles and embroidery
are alike occasional, and the mind is often
dressed for show in painted honour and fictitious
benevolence.
</p>

<p>Every man must have found some whose lives,
in every house but their own, was a continual series
of hypocrisy, and who concealed under fair appearances
bad qualities, which, whenever they thought
themselves out of the reach of censure, broke out
from their restraint, like winds imprisoned in their
caverns, and whom every one had reason to love,
but they whose love a wise man is chiefly solicitous
to procure.  And there are others who, without any
show of general goodness, and without the attractions
by which popularity is conciliated, are received
among their own families as bestowers of happiness,
and reverenced as instructors, guardians, and
benefactors.
</p>

<p>The most authentick writnessess of any man's
character are those who know him in his own family,
and see him without any restraint or rule of conduct,
but such as he voluntarily prescribes to himself.
If a man carries virtue with him into his private
apartments, and takes no advantage of unlimited
power or probable secrecy; if we trace him through
the round of his time, and find that his character
with those allowances which mortal frailty must
always want, is uniform and regular, we have all the
evidence of his sincerity that one man can have with

<pb n="83"/>

regard to another: and, indeed, as hypocrisy cannot
be its own reward, we may, without hesitation,
determine that his heart is pure.
</p>

<p>The highest panegyrick, therefore, that private
virtue can receive, is the praise of servants.  For,
however vanity or insolence may look down with
contempt on the suffrage of men undignified by
wealth, and unenlightened by education, it very
seldom happens that they commend or blame without
justice.  Vice and virtue are easily distinguished.
Oppression, according to Harrington's aphorism,
will be felt by those that cannot see it; and, perhaps,
it falls out very often that, in moral questions, the
philosophers in the gown, and in the livery,
differ not so much in their sentiments, as in their
language, and have equal power of discerning right,
though they cannot point it out to others with equal
address.
</p>

<p>There are very few faults to be committed in solitude,
or without some agents, partners, confederates,
or witnesses; and, therefore, the servant must
commonly know the secrets of a master, who has any
secrets to entrust; and failings, merely personal, are
so frequently exposed by that security which pride
and folly generally produce, and so inquisitively
watched by that desire of reducing the inequalities
of condition, which the lower orders of the world
will always feel, that the testimony of a menial domestick
can seldom be considered as defective for
want of knowledge.  And though its impartiality
may be sometimes suspected, it is at least as credi-
<pb n="84"/>

ble as that of equals, where rivalry instigates censure,
or friendship dictates palliations.
</p>

<p>The danger of betraying our weakness to our
servants, and the impossibility of concealing it from
them, may be justly considered as one motive to a
regular and irreproachable life.  For no condition is
more hateful or despicable, than his who has put himself
in the power of his servant; in the power of him
whom, perhaps, he has first corrupted by making
him subservient to his vices, and whose fidelity he
therefore cannot enforce by any precepts of honesty
or reason.  It is seldom known that authority thus
acquired, is possessed without insolence, or that the
master is not forced to confess by his tameness or
forbearance, that he has enslaved himself by some
foolish confidence.  And his crime is equally punished,
whatever part he takes of the choice to which
he is reduced; and he is from that fatal hour, in
which he sacrifices his dignity to his passions, in
perpetual dread of insolence or defamation; of a controuler
at home, or an accuser abroad.  He is condemned
to purchase, by continual bribes, that
secrecy which bribes never secured, and which, after
a long course of submission, promises, and anxieties,
he will find violated in a fit of rage, or in a frolick
of drunkenness.
</p>

<p>To dread no eye, and to suspect no tongue, is
the great prerogative of innocence; an exemption
granted only to invariable virtue.  But guilt has always
its horrours and solicitudes; and to make it
yet more shameful and detestable, it is doomed

<pb n="85"/>

often to stand in awe of those, to whom nothing
could give influence or weight, but their power of
betraying.

</epigraph>

<p>AN old Greek epigrammatist, intending to shew
the miseries that attend the last stage of man,
imprecates upon those who are so foolish as to wish
for long life, the calamity of continuing to grow
old from century to century.  He thought that no
adventitious or foreign pain was requisite; that decrepitude
itself was an epitome of whatever is dreadful;
and nothing could be added to the curse of age,
but that it should be extended beyond its natural
limits.
</p>

<p>The most indifferent or negligent spectator can
indeed scarcely retire without heaviness of heart,
from a view of the last scenes of the tragedy of life,
in which he finds those who, in the former parts of
the drama, were distinguished by opposition of conduct,
contrariety of designs, and dissimilitude of
personal qualities, all involved in one common dis-
<pb n="86"/>

tress, and all struggling with affliction which they
cannot hope to overcome.
</p>

<p>The other miseries, which way-lay our passage
through the world, wisdom may escape, and fortitude
may conquer: by caution and circumspection
we may steal along with very little to obstruct or
incommode us; by spirit and vigour we may force
a way, and reward the vexation of contest by the
pleasures of victory.  But a time must come when
our policy and bravery shall be equally useless;
when we shall all sink into helplessness and sadness,
without any power of receiving solace from the
pleasures that have formerly delighted us, or any
prospect of emerging into a second possession of
the blessings that we have lost.
</p>

<p>The industry of man has, indeed, not been wanting
in endeavours to procure comforts for these
hours of dejection and melancholy, and to gild the
dreadful gloom with artificial light.  The most usual
support of old age is wealth.  He whose possessions
are large, and whose chests are full, imagines himself
always fortified against invasions of his authority,
If he has lost all other means of government, if his
strength and his reason fail him, he can at last alter
his will; and therefore all that have hopes must
likewise have fears, and he may still continue to
give laws to such as have not ceased to regard their
own interest.
</p>

<p>This is, indeed, too frequently the citadel of the
dotard, the last fortress to which age retires, and in
which he makes the stand against the upstart race

<pb n="87"/>

that seizes his domains, disputes his commands, and
cancels his prescriptions.  But here, though there
may be safety, there is no pleasure; and what remains
is but a proof that more was once possessed.
</p>

<p>Nothing seems to have been more universally
dreaded by the ancients than orbity, or want of
children; and, indeed, to a man who has survived
all the companions of his youth, all who have
participated his pleasures and his cares, have been
engaged in the same events, and filled their minds
with the same conceptions, this full-peopled world
is a dismal solitude.  He stands forlorn and silent,
neglected or insulted, in the midst of multitudes,
animated with hopes which he cannot share, and
employed in business which he is no longer able to
forward or retard; nor can he find any to whom his
life or his death are of importance, unless he has
secured some domestick gratifications, some tender
employments, and endeared himself to some whose
interest and gratitude may unite them to him.
</p>

<p>So different are the colours of life as we look
forward to the future, or backward to the past; and so
different the opinions and sentiments which this
contrariety of appearance naturally produces, that
the conversation of the old and young ends generally
with contempt or pity on either side.  To a young
man entering the world with fulness of hope, and
ardour of pursuit, nothing is so unpleasing as the
cold caution, the faint expectations, the scrupulous
diffidence, which experience and disappointments
certainly infuse; and the old man wonders in his

<pb n="88"/>

turn that the world never can grow wiser, that
neither precepts, nor testimonies, can cure boys of
their credulity and sufficiency; and that not one can
be convinced that snares are laid for him, till he
finds himself entangled.
</p>

<p>Thus one generation is always the scorn and
wonder of the other; and the notions of the old and
young are like liquors of different gravity and texture,
which never can unite.  The spirits of youth
sublimed by health, and volatilized by passion, soon
leave behind them the phlegmatick sediment of
weariness and deliberation, and burst out in temerity
and enterprise.  The tenderness, therefore, which
nature infuses, and which long habits of beneficence
confirm, is necessary to reconcile such opposition;
and an old man must be a father to bear with
patience those follies and absurdities which he will
perpetually imagine himself to find in the schemes
and expectations, the pleasures and the sorrows, of
those who have not yet been hardened by time, and
chilled by frustration.
</p>

<p>Yet it may be doubted, whether the pleasure of
seeing children ripening into strength, be not over-balanced by the pain of seeing some fall in the
blossom, and others blasted in their growth; some
shaken down with storms, some tainted with cankers,
and some shrivelled in the shade; and whether
he that extends his care beyond himself, does not
multiply his anxieties more than his pleasures, and
weary himself to no purpose, by superintending
what he cannot regulate.

<pb n="89"/>

</p>

<p>But though age be to every order of human
beings sufficiently terrible, it is particularly to be
dreaded by fine ladies, who have had no other end
or ambition than to fill up the day and the night
with dress, diversions, and flattery, and who, having
made no acquaintance with knowledge, or with
business, have constantly caught all their ideas from
the current prattle of the hour, and been indebted
for all their happiness to compliments and treats.
With these ladies, age begins early, and very often
lasts long; it begins when their beauty fades, when
their mirth loses its sprightliness, and their motion
its ease.  From that time all which gave them joy
vanishes from about them; they hear the praises bestowed
on others, which used to swell their bosoms
with exultation.  They visit the seats of felicity, and
endeavour to continue the habit of being delighted.
But pleasure is only received when we believe that
we give it in return.  Neglect and petulance inform
them that their power and their value are past; and
what then remains but a tedious and comfortless
uniformity of time, without any motion of the heart,
or exercise of the reason?
</p>

<p>Yet, however age may discourage us by its appearance
from considering it in prospect, we shall
all by degrees certainly be old; and therefore we
ought to inquire what provision can be made against
that time of distress? what happiness can be stored
up against the winter of life? and how we may pass
our latter years with serenity and cheerfulness?
</p>

<p>If it has been found by the experience of man-
<pb n="90"/>

kind, that not even the best seasons of life are able
to supply sufficient gratifications, without anticipating
uncertain felicities, it cannot surely be supposed
that old age, worn with labours, harassed
with anxieties, and tortured with diseases, should
have any gladness of its own, or feel any satisfaction
from the contemplation of the present.  All the comfort
that can now be expected must be recalled from
the past, or borrowed from the future; the past is
very soon exhausted, all the events or actions which
the memory can afford pleasure are quickly recollected;
and the future lies beyond the grave, where
it can be reached only by virtue and devotion.
</p>

<p>Piety is the only proper and adequate relief of
decaying man.  He that grows old without religious
hopes, as he declines into imbecility, and feels pains
and sorrows incessantly crowding upon him, falls
into a gulph of bottomless misery, in which every
reflection must plunge him deeper, and where he
finds only new gradations of anguish, and precipices
of horrour.

<p>HESIOD, in his celebrated distribution of mankind,
divides them into three orders of intellect.
"The first place," says he, "belongs to him that
can by his own powers discern what is right and fit,

<pb n="91"/>

and penetrate to the remoter motives of action.
The second is claimed by him that is willing to hear
instruction, and can perceive right and wrong when
they are shewn him by another; but he that has
neither acuteness nor docility, who can neither find
the way by himself, nor will be led by others, is a
wretch without use or value."
</p>

<p>If we survey the moral world, it will be found,
that the same division may be made of men, with
regard to their virtue.  There are some whose principles
are so firmly fixed, whose conviction is so constantly
present to their minds, and who have raised
in themselves such ardent wishes for the approbation
of God, and the happiness with which he has
promised to reward obedience and perseverance,
that they rise above all other cares and considerations,
and uniformly examine every action and desire,
by comparing it with the divine commands.
There are others in a kind of equipoise between
good and ill; who are moved on the one part by
riches or pleasure, by the gratifications of passion
and the delights of sense; and, on the other, by laws
of which they own the obligation, and rewards of
which they believe the reality, and whom a very
small addition of weight turns either way.  The third
class consists of beings immersed in pleasure, or
abandoned to passion, without any desire of higher
good, or any effort to extend their thoughts beyond
immediate and gross satisfactions.
</p>

<p>The second class is so much the most numerous,
that it may be considered as comprising the whole

<pb n="92"/>

body of mankind.  Those of the last are not very
many, and those of the first are very few; and
neither the one nor the other fall much under the
consideration of the moralists, whose precepts are
intended chiefly for those who are endeavouring to
go forward up the steeps of virtue, not for those
who have already reached the summit, or those
who are resolved to stay for ever in their present
situation.
</p>

<p>To a man not versed in the living world, but
accustomed to judge only by speculative reason, it is
scarcely credible that any one should be in this state
of indifference, or stand undetermined and unengaged,
ready to follow the first call to either side.
It seems certain, that either a man must believe
that virtue will make him happy, and resolve therefore
to be virtuous, or think that he may be happy
without virtue, and therefore cast off all care but
for his present interest.  It seems impossible that
conviction should be on one side, and practice on
the other; and that he who has seen the right way
should voluntarily shut his eyes, that he may quit
it with more tranquillity.  Yet all these absurdities
are every hour to be found; the wisest and best men
deviate from known and acknowledged duties, by
inadvertency or surprise; and most are good no
longer than while temptation is away, than while
their passions are without excitements, and their
opinions are free from the counteraction of any
other motive.
</p>

<p>Among the sentiments which almost every man

<pb n="93"/>

changes as he advances into years, is the expectation
of uniformity of character.  He that without
acquaintance with the power of desire, the cogency
of distress, the complications of affairs, or the force
of partial influence, has filled his mind with the excellence
of virtue, and, having never tried his resolution
in any encounters with hope or fear, believes
it able to stand firm whatever shall oppose it, will
be always clamorous against the smallest failure,
ready to exact the utmost punctualities of right,
and to consider every man that fails in any part of
his duty, as without conscience and without merit;
unworthy of trust or love, of pity or regard; as an
enemy whom all should join to drive out of society,
as a pest which all should avoid, or as a weed which
all should trample.
</p>

<p>It is not but by experience, that we are taught
the possibility of retaining some virtues, and rejecting
others, or of being good or bad to a particular
degree.  For it is very easy to the solitary reasoner,
to prove that the same arguments by which the
mind is fortified against one crime are of equal force
against all, and the consequence very naturally
follows, that he whom they fail to move on any
occasion, has either never considered them, or has
by some fallacy taught himself to evade their
validity; and that, therefore, when a man is known
to be guilty of one crime, no farther evidence is
needful of his depravity and corruption.
</p>

<p>Yet such is the state of all mortal virtue, that it
is always uncertain and variable, sometimes extend-
<pb n="94"/>

ing to the whole compass of duty, and sometimes
shrinking into a narrow space, and fortifying only a
few avenues of the heart, while all the rest is left
open to the incursions of appetite, or given up to the
dominion of wickedness.  Nothing therefore is more
unjust than to judge of man by too short an
acquaintance, and too slight inspection; for it often
happens, that in the loose, and thoughtless, and
dissipated, there is a secret radical worth, which may
shoot out by proper cultivation; that the spark of
heaven, though dimmed and obstructed, is yet not
extinguished, but may, by the breath of counsel and
exhortation, be kindled into flame.
</p>

<p>To imagine that every one who is not completely
good is irrecoverably abandoned, is to suppose that
all are capable of the same degree of excellence; it
is indeed to exact from all that perfection which
none ever can attain.  And since the purest virtue is
consistent with some vice, and the virtue of the
greatest number with almost an equal proportion of
contrary qualities, let none too hastily conclude,
that all goodness is lost, though it may for a time
be clouded and overwhelmed; for most minds are
the slaves of external circumstances, and conform
to any hand that undertakes to mould them, roll
down any torrent of custom in which they happen
to be caught, or bend to any importunity that bears
hard against them.
</p>

<p>It may be particularly observed of women, that
they are for the most part good or bad, as they fall
among those who practise vice or virtue; and that

<pb n="95"/>

neither education nor reason gives them much security
against the influence of example.  Whether
it be that they have less courage to stand against
opposition, or that their desire of admiration makes
them sacrifice their principles to the poor pleasure
of worthless praise, it is certain, whatever be the
cause, that female goodness seldom keeps its ground
against laughter, flattery, or fashion.
</p>

<p>For this reason, every one should consider himself
as entrusted, not only with his own conduct, but
with that of others; and as accountable, not only
for the duties which he neglects, or the crimes that
he commits, but for that negligence and irregularity
which he may encourage or inculcate.  Every man,
in whatever station, has, or endeavours to have, his
followers, admirers, and imitators, and has therefore
the influence of his example to watch with care; he
ought to avoid not only crimes, but the appearance
of crimes, and not only to practise virtue, but to applaud,
countenance, and support it.  For it is possible
that for want of attention, we may teach others
faults from which ourselves are free, or by a cowardly
desertion of a cause which we ourselves approve,
may pervert those who fix their eyes upon us, and
having no rule of their own to guide their course,
are easily misled by the aberrations of that example
which they choose for their direction.

</epigraph>

<p>MANY words and sentences are so frequently
heard in the mouths of men, that a superficial
observer is inclined to believe, that they must contain
some primary principle, some great rule of action,
which it is proper always to have present to the
attention, and by which the use of every hour is to
be adjusted.  Yet, if we consider the conduct of those
sententious philosophers, it will often be found, that
they repeat these aphorisms, merely because they
have somewhere heard them, because they have
nothing else to say, or because they think veneration
gained by such appearances of wisdom, but
that no ideas are annexed to the words, and that,
according to the old blunder of the followers of
Aristotle, their souls are mere pipes or organs, which
transmit sounds, but do not understand them.
</p>

<p>Of this kind is the well-known and well-attested
position, that <hi rend="italic">life is short</hi>, which may be heard
among mankind by an attentive auditor, many times
a day, but which never yet within my reach of
observation left any impression upon the mind; and
perhaps, if my readers will turn their thoughts back
upon their old friends, they will find it difficult to
call a single man to remembrance, who appeared

<pb n="97"/>

to know that life was short till he was about
to lose it.
</p>

<p>It is observable that Horace, in his account of the
characters of men, as they are diversified by the
various influence of time, remarks, that the old man
is <foreign lang="lat" ><hi rend="italic">dilator, spe longus</hi></foreign>, given to procrastination, and
inclined to extend his hopes to a great distance.  So
far are we generally from thinking what we often
say of the shortness of life, that at the time when it
is necessarily shortest, we form projects which we
delay to execute, indulge such expectations as nothing
but a long train of events can gratify, and suffer
those passions to gain upon us, which are only
excusable in the prime of life.
</p>

<p>These reflections were lately excited in my mind,
by an evening's conversation with my friend Prospero,
who, at the age of fifty-five, has bought an
estate, and is now contriving to dispose and cultivate
it with uncommon elegance.  His great pleasure is to
walk among stately trees, and lie musing in the heat
of noon under their shade; he is therefore maturely
considering how he shall dispose his walks and his
groves, and has at last determined to send for the
best plans from Italy, and forbear planting till the
next season.
</p>

<p>Thus is life trifled away in preparations to do
what never can be done, if it be left unattempted
till all the requisites which imagination can suggest
are gathered together.  Where our design terminates
only in our own satisfaction, the mistake is of no
great importance; for the pleasure of expecting

<pb n="98"/>

enjoyment is often greater than that of obtaining
it, and the completion of almost every wish is found
a disappointment; but when many others are interested
in an undertaking, when any design is
formed, in which the improvement or security of
mankind is involved, nothing is more unworthy
either of wisdom or benevolence, than to delay it
from time to time, or to forget how much every day
that passes over us takes away from our power, and
how soon an idle purpose to do an action, sinks into
a mournful wish that it had once been done.
</p>

<p>We are frequently importuned, by the bacchanalian
writers, to lay hold on the present hour, to
catch the pleasures within our reach, and remember
that futurity is not at our command.

</lg>

<p>But surely these exhortations may, with equal
propriety, be applied to better purposes; it may be
at least inculcated that pleasures are more safely
postponed than virtues, and that greater loss is
suffered by missing an opportunity of doing good,
than an hour of giddy frolick and noisy merriment.
</p>

<p>When Baxter had lost a thousand pounds, which
he had laid up for the erection of a school, he used
frequently to mention the misfortune as an incitement
to be charitable while God gives the power
of bestowing, and considered himself as culpable in

<pb n="99"/>

some degree for having left a good action in the
hands of chance, and suffered his benevolence to be
defeated for want of quickness and diligence.
</p>

<p>It is lamented by Hearne, the learned antiquary
of Oxford, that this general forgetfulness of the
fragility of life, has remarkably infected the students
of monuments and records; as their employment
consists first in collecting, and afterwards in arranging
or abstracting what libraries afford them, they
ought to amass no more than they can digest; but
when they have undertaken a work, they go on
searching and transcribing. call for new supplies,
when they are already overburthened, and at last
leave their work unfinished. <hi rend="italic">It is, says he, the
business of a good antiquary, as of a good man, to
have mortality always before him</hi>.
</p>

<p>Thus, not only in the slumber of sloth, but in the
dissipation of ill-directed industry, is the shortness
of life generally forgotten.  As some men lose their
hours in laziness, because they suppose, that there
is time enough for the reparation of neglect; others
busy themselves in providing that no length of life
may want employment; and it often happens, that
sluggishness and activity are equally surprised by
the last summons, and perish not more differently
from each other, than the fowl that received the shot
in her flight, from her that is killed upon the bush.
</p>

<p>Among the many improvments made by the last
centuries in human knowledge, may be numbered
the exact calculations of the value of life; but whatever
may be their use in traffick, they seem very

<pb n="100"/>

little to have advanced morality.  They have hitherto
been rather applied to the acquisition of money,
than of wisdom; the computer refers none of his
calculations to his own tenure, but persists, in contempt
of probability, to foretel old age to himself,
and believes that he is marked out to reach the
utmost verge of human existence, and see thousands
and ten thousands fall into the grave.
</p>

<p>So deeply is this fallacy rooted in the heart, and
so strongly guarded by hope and fear against the
approach of reason, that neither science nor experience
can shake it, and we act as if life were without
end, though we see and confess its uncertainty and
shortness.
</p>

<p>Divines have, with great strength and ardour,
shewn the absurdity of delaying reformation and
repentance; a degree of folly, indeed, which sets
eternity to hazard.  It is the same weakness, in proportion
to the importance of the neglect, to transfer
any care, which now claims our attention, to a future
time; we subject ourselves to needless dangers from
accidents which early diligence would have obviated,
or perplex our minds by vain precautions, and make
provision for the execution of designs, of which the
opportunity once missed never will return.
</p>

<p>As he that lives longest lives but a little while,
every man may be certain that he has no time to
waste.  The duties of life are commensurate to its
duration, and every day brings its task, which if
neglected is doubled on the morrow.  But he that
has already trifled away those months and years, in

<pb n="101"/>

which he should have laboured, must remember that
he has now only a part of that of which the whole
is little; and that since the few moments remaining
are to be considered as the last trust of heaven, not
one is to be lost.

<opener>TO THE RAMBLER.<lb/>

<salute>SIR,
</salute>

</opener>

<p>THOSE who exalt themselves into the chair of
instruction, without inquiring whether any will
submit to their authority, have not sufficiently considered
how much of human life passes in little incidents,
cursory conversation, slight business, and
casual amusements; and therefore they have endeavoured
only to inculcate the more awful virtues, without
condescending to regard those petty qualities,
which grow important only by their frequency, and
which, though they produce no single acts of heroism,
nor astonish us by great events, yet are every
moment exerting their influence upon us, and make
the draught of life sweet or bitter by imperceptible
instillations.  They operate unseen and unregarded,
as change of air makes us sick or healthy, though
we breathe it without attention, and only know the

<pb n="102"/>

particles that impregnate it by their salutary or
malignant effects.
</p>

<p>You have shewn yourself not ignorant of the value
of those subaltern endowments, yet have hitherto
neglected to recommend good-humour to the world,
though a little reflection will shew you that it is the
<hi rend="italic">balm of being</hi>, the quality to which all that adorns
or elevates mankind must owe its power of pleasing.
Without good-humour, learning and bravery can
only confer that superiority which swells the heart
of the lion in the desert, where he roars without
reply, and ravages without resistance.  Without
good-humour, virtue may awe by its dignity, and
amaze by its brightness; but must always be viewed
at a distance, and will scarcely gain a friend or
attract an imitator.
</p>

<p>Good-humour may be defined a habit of being
pleased; a constant and perennial softness of manner,
easiness of approach, and suavity of disposition;
like that which every man perceives in himself,
when the first transports of new felicity have
subsided, and his thoughts are only kept in motion by
a slow succession of soft impulses.  Good humour is
a state between gaiety and unconcern; the act or
emanation of a mind at leisure to regard the
gratification of another.
</p>

<p>It is imagined by many, that whenever they
aspire to please, they are required to be merry, and
to shew the gladness of their souls by flights of
pleasantry, and bursts of laughter.  But though these
men may be for a time heard with applause and

<pb n="103"/>

admiration, they seldom delight us long.  We enjoy
them a little, and then retire to easiness and good-humour, as the eye gazes awhile on eminences glittering
with the sun, but soon turns aching away
to verdure and to flowers.
</p>

<p>Gaiety is to good-humour as animal perfumes to
vegetable fragrance; the one overpowers weak spirits,
and the other recreates and revives them.  Gaiety
seldom fails to give some pain; the hearers either
strain their faculties to accompany its towerings, or
are left behind in envy and despair.  Good-humour
boasts no faculties which every one does not believe
in his own power, and pleases principally by not
offending.
</p>

<p>It is well known that the most certain way to
give any man pleasure, is to persuade him that you
receive pleasure from him, to encourage him to
freedom and confidence, and to avoid any such appearance
of superiority as may overbear and depress
him.  We see many that by this art only spend their
days in the midst of caresses, invitations, and civilities;
and without any extraordinary qualities or attainments,
are the universal favourites of both sexes,
and certainly find a friend in every place.  The darlings
of the world will, indeed, be generally found
such as excite neither jealousy nor fear, and are not
considered as candidates for any eminent degree of
reputation, but content themselves with common
accomplishments, and endeavour rather to solicit
kindness than to raise esteem; therefore in assemblies
and places of resort it seldom fails to happen,

<pb n="104"/>

that though at the entrance of some particular person
every face brightens with gladness, and every
hand is extended in salutation, yet if you pursue
him beyond the first exchange of civilities, you will
find him of very small importance, and only welcome
to the company, as one by whom all conceive
themselves admired, and with whom any one is at
liberty to amuse himself when he can find no other
auditor or companion; as one with whom all are at
ease, who will hear a jest without criticism, and a
narrative without contradiction, who laughs with
every wit, and yields to every disputer.
</p>

<p>There are many whose vanity always inclines
them to associate with those from whom they have
no reason to fear mortification; and there are times
in which the wise and the knowing are willing to
receive praise without the labour of deserving it, in
which the most elevated mind is willing to descend,
and the most active to be at rest.  All therefore are
at some hour or another fond of companions whom
they can entertain upon easy terms, and who will
relieve them from solitude, without condemning
them to vigilance and caution.  We are most inclined
to love when we have nothing to fear, and he that
encourages us to please ourselves, will not be long
without preference in our affection to those whose
learning holds us at the distance of pupils, or whose
wit calls all attention from us, and leaves us without
importance, and without regard.
</p>

<p>It is remarked by prince Henry, when he sees
Falstaff lying on the ground, that <hi rend="italic">he could
have

<pb n="105"/>

better spared a better man</hi>.  He was well acquainted
with the vices and follies of him whom he lamented,
but while his conviction compelled him to do justice
to superior qualities, his tenderness still broke
out at the remembrance of Falstaff, of the cheerful
companion, the loud buffoon, with whom he had
passed his time in all the luxury of idleness, who
had gladded him with unenvied merriment, and
whom he could at once enjoy and despise.
</p>

<p>You may perhaps think this account of those
who are distinguished for their good-humour, not
very consistent with the praises which I have bestowed
upon it.  But surely nothing can more evidently
shew the value of this quality, than that it
recommends those who are destitute of all other
excellencies, and procures regard to the trifling,
friendship to the worthless, and affection to the dull.
</p>

<p>Good-humour is indeed generally degraded by the
characters in which it is found; for, being considered
as a cheap and vulgar quality, we find it often neglected
by those that, having excellencies of higher
reputation and brighter splendour, perhaps imagine
that they have some right to gratify themselves at
the expense of others, and are to demand compliance,
rather than to practise it.  It is by some unfortunate
mistake that almost all those who have
any claim to esteem or love, press their pretensions
with too little consideration of others.  This mistake,
my own interest, as well as my zeal for general
happiness, makes me desirous to rectify; for I have
a friend, who, because he knows his own fidelity

<pb n="106"/>

and usefulness, is never willing to sink into a companion:
I have a wife whose beauty first subdued
me, and whose wit confirmed her conquest, but
whose beauty now serves no other purpose than to
entitle her to tyranny, and whose wit is only used
to justify perverseness.
</p>

<p>Surely nothing can be more unreasonable than to
lose the will to please, when we are conscious of the
power, or show more cruelty than to chuse any kind
of influence before that of kindness.  He that regards
the welfare of others, should make his virtue
approachable, that it may be loved and copied; and
he that considers the wants which every man feels,
or will feel, of external assistance, must rather wish
to be surrounded by those that love him, than by
those that admire his excellencies, or solicit his
favours; for admiration ceases with novelty, and interest
gains its end and retires.  A man whose great
qualities want the ornament of superficial attractions,
is like a naked mountain with mines of gold,
which will be frequented only till the treasure is
exhausted.

<opener>TO THE RAMBLER.<lb/>

<salute>SIR,
</salute>

</opener>

<p>IF you feel any of that compassion which you
recommend to others, you will not disregard a case
which I have reason from observation to believe
very common, and which I know by experience to
be very miserable.  And though the querulous are
seldom received with great ardour of kindness, I
hope to escape the mortification of finding that my
lamentations spread the contagion of impatience,
and produce anger rather than tenderness.  I write
not merely to vent the swelling of my heart, but to
inquire by what means I may recover my tranquillity;
and shall endeavour at brevity in my narrative,
having long known that complaint quickly
tires, however elegant, or however just.
</p>

<p>I was born in a remote county, of a family that
boasts alliances with the greatest names in English
history, and extends its claims of affinity to the
Tudors and Plantagenets.  My ancestors, by little
and little, wasted their patrimony, till my father had
not enough left for the support of a family, without
descending to the cultivation of his own grounds,
being condemned to pay three sisters the fortunes

<pb n="108"/>

allotted them by my grandfather, who is suspected
to have made his will when he was incapable of adjusting
properly the claims of his children, and who,
perhaps without design, enriched his daughters by
beggaring his son.  My aunts being, at the death of
their father, neither young nor beautiful, nor very
eminent for softness of behaviour, were suffered to
live unsolicited, and by accumulating the interest of
their portions grew every day richer and prouder.  My
father pleased himself with foreseeing that the
possessions of those ladies must revert at last to the
hereditary estate, and that his family might lose
none of its dignity, resolved to keep me untainted
with a lucrative employment; whenever therefore
I discovered any inclination to the improvement
of my condition, my mother never failed to put me
in mind of my birth, and charged me to do nothing
with which I might be reproached when I should
come to my aunts' estate.
</p>

<p>In all the perplexities or vexations which want of
money brought upon us, it was our constant practice
to have recourse to futurity.  If any of our neighbours
surpassed us in appearance, we went home
and contrived an equipage, with which the death of
my aunts was to supply us.  If any purse-proud upstart
was deficient in respect, vengeance was referred
to the time in which our estate was to be repaired.
We registered every act of civility and rudeness,
inquired the number of dishes at every feast, and
minuted the furniture of every house, that we might,
when the hour of affluence should come, be able

<pb n="109"/>

to eclipse all their splendour, and surpass all their
magnificence.
</p>

<p>Upon plans of elegance and schemes of pleasure
the day rose and set, and the year went round unregarded,
while we were busied in laying out plantations
on ground not yet our own, and deliberating
whether the manor-house should be rebuilt or repaired.
This was the amusement of our leisure, and
the solace of our exigencies; we met together only
to contrive how our approaching fortune should be
enjoyed; for in this our conversation always ended,
on whatever subject it began.  We had none of the
collateral interests which diversify the life of others
with joys and hopes, but had turned our whole
attention on one event, which we could neither
hasten nor retard, and had no other object of curiosity
than the health or sickness of my aunts, of
which we were careful to procure very exact and
early intelligence.
</p>

<p>This visionary opulence for a while soothed our
imagination, but afterwards fired our wishes, and
exasperated our necessities, and my father could
not always restrain himself from exclaiming, that
<hi rend="italic">no creature had so many lives as a cat and an old
maid</hi>.  At last, upon the recovery of his sister from
an ague, which she was supposed to have caught by
sparing fire, he began to lose his stomach, and four
months afterwards sunk into his grave.
</p>

<p>My mother, who loved her husband, survived
him but a little while, and left me the sole heir of
their lands, their schemes, and their wishes.  As I

<pb n="110"/>

had not enlarged my conceptions either by books or
conversation, I differed only from my father by the
freshness of my cheeks, and the vigour of my step;
and, like him, gave way to no thoughts but of enjoying
the wealth which my aunts were hoarding.
</p>

<p>At length the eldest fell ill.  I paid the civilities
and compliments which sickness requires with the
utmost punctuality.  I dreamed every night of
escutcheons and white gloves, and inquired every
morning at an early hour, whether there were any
news of my dear aunt.  At last a messenger was sent
to inform me that I must come to her without the
delay of a moment.  I went and heard her last
advice, but opening her will, found that she had
left her fortune to her second sister.
</p>

<p>I hung my head; the youngest sister threatened
to be married, and every thing was disappointment
and discontent.  I was in danger of losing irreparably
one third of my hopes, and was condemned still to
wait for the rest.  Of part of my terror I was soon
eased; for the youth whom his relations would have
compelled to marry the old lady, after innumerable
stipulations, articles, and settlements, ran away with
the daughter of his father's groom; and my aunt,
upon this conviction of the perfidy of man, resolved
never to listen more to amorous addresses.
</p>

<p>Ten years longer I dragged the shackles of expectation,
without ever suffering a day to pass, in
which I did not compute how much my chance
was improved of being rich to-morrow.  At last the
second lady died, after a short illness, which yet

<pb n="111"/>

was long enough to afford her time for the disposal
of her estate, which she gave to me after the death
of her sister.
</p>

<p>I was now relieved from part of my misery; a
larger fortune, though not in my power, was certain
and unalienable; nor was there now any danger,
that I might at last be frustrated of my hopes by
a fret of dotage, the flatteries of a chambermaid,
the whispers of a tale-bearer, or the officiousness of
a nurse.  But my wealth was yet in reversion, my
aunt was to be buried before I could emerge to
grandeur and pleasure; and there were yet, according
to my father's observation, nine lives between
me and happiness.
</p>

<p>I however lived on, without any clamours of
discontent, and comforted myself with considering,
that all are mortal, and they who are continually
decaying must at last be destroyed.
</p>

<p>But let no man from this time suffer his felicity
to depend on the death of his aunt.  The good gentlewoman
was very regular in her hours, and simple
in her diet, and in walking or sitting still, walking
or sleeping, had always in view the preservation of
her health.  She was subject to no disorder but
hypochondriac dejection; by which, without intention,
she increased my miseries, for whenever the weather
was cloudy, she would take her bed and send me
notice that her time was come.  I went with all the
haste of eagerness, and sometimes received passionate
injunctions to be kind to her maid, and directions
how the last offices should be performed; but

<pb n="112"/>

if before my arrival the sun happened to break out,
or the wind to change, I met her at the door, or
found her in the garden, bustling and vigilant, with
all the tokens of long life.
</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, she fell into distempers, and
was thrice given over by the doctor, yet she found
means of slipping through the gripe of death, and
after having tortured me three months at each time
with violent alternations of hope and fear, came
out of her chamber without any other hurt than
the loss of flesh, which in a few weeks she recovered
by broths and jellies.
</p>

<p>As most have sagacity sufficient to guess at the
desires of an heir, it was the constant practice of
those who were hoping at second hand, and
endeavoured to secure my favour against the time
when I should be rich, to pay their court, by informing
me that my aunt began to droop, that she had
lately a bad night, that she coughed feebly, and that
she could never climb May-hill; or, at least, that
the autumn would carry her off.  Thus was I flattered
in the winter with the piercing winds of
March, and in summer, with the fogs of September.
But she lived through spring and fall, and set heat
and cold at defiance, till, after near half a century,
I buried her on the fourteenth of last June, aged
ninety-three years, five months, and six days.
</p>

<p>For two months after her death I was rich, and
was pleased with that obsequiousness and reverence
which wealth instantaneously procures.  But this joy
is now past, and I have returned again to my old

<pb n="113"/>

habit of wishing.  Being accustomed to give the
future full power over my mind, and to start away
from the scene before me to some expected enjoyment,
I deliver up myself to the tyranny of every
desire which fancy suggests, and long for a thousand
things which I am unable to procure.  Money has
much less power than is ascribed to it by those that
want it.  I had formed schemes which I cannot execute,
I had supposed events which do not come to
pass, and the rest of my life must pass in craving
solicitude, unless you can find some remedy for a
mind, corrupted with an inveterate disease of wishing,
and unable to think on any thing but wants,
which reason tells me will never be supplied.

<p>MEN seldom give pleasure, where they are not
pleased themselves; it is necessary, therefore,
to cultivate an habitual alacrity and cheerfulness,
that in whatever state we may be placed by Providence,
whether we are appointed to confer or receive
benefits, to implore or to afford protection,
we may secure the love of those with whom we
transact.  For though it is generally imagined, that
he who grants favours, may spare any attention to
his behaviour, and that usefulness will always pro-
<pb n="114"/>

cure friends; yet it has been found, that there is an
art of granting requests, an art very difficult of
attainment; that officiousness and liberality may be so
adulterated, as to lose the greater part of their effect;
that compliance may provoke, relief may harass, and
liberality distress.
</p>

<p>No disease of the mind can more fatally disable
it from benevolence, the chief duty of social beings,
than ill-humour or peevishness; for though it breaks
not out in paroxysms of outrage, nor bursts into
clamour, turbulence, and bloodshed, it wears out
happiness by slow corrosion, and small injuries
incessantly repeated.  It may be considered as the
canker of life, that destroys its vigour, and checks
its improvement, that creeps on with hourly depredations,
and taints and vitiates what it cannot
consume.
</p>

<p>Peevishness, when it has been so far indulged, as
to outrun the motions of the will, and discover itself
without premeditation, is a species of depravity in
the highest degree disgusting and offensive, because
no rectitude of intention, nor softness of address,
can ensure a moment's exemption from affront and
indignity.  While we are courting the favour of a
peevish man, and exerting ourselves in the most
diligent civility, an unlucky syllable displeases, an
unheeded circumstance ruffles and exasperates; and
in the moment when we congratulate ourselves
upon having gained a friend, our endeavours are
frustrated at once, and all our assiduity forgotten,
in the casual tumult of some trifling irritation.

<pb n="115"/>

</p>

<p>This troublesome impatience is sometimes nothing
more than the symptom of some deeper malady.
He that is angry without daring to confess his
resentment, or sorrowful without the liberty of telling
his grief; is too frequently inclined to give vent
to the fermentations of his mind at the first passages
that are opened, and to let his passions boil
over upon those whom accident throws in his way.
A painful and tedious course of sickness frequently
produces such an alarming apprehension of the least
increase of uneasiness, as keeps the soul perpetually
on the watch, such a restless and incessant solicitude,
as no care or tenderness can appease, and can
only be pacified by the cure of the distemper, and
the removal of that pain by which it is excited.
</p>

<p>Nearly approaching to this weakness, is the
captiousness of old age.  When the strength is crushed,
the senses dulled, and the common pleasures of life
become insipid by repetition, we are willing to impute
our uneasiness to causes not wholly out of our
power, and please ourselves with fancying that we
suffer by neglect, unkindness, or any evil which admits
a remedy, rather than by the decays of nature,
which cannot be prevented or repaired.  We therefore
revenge our pains upon those on whom we resolve
to charge them; and too often drive mankind
away at the time we have the greatest need of
tenderness and assistance.
</p>

<p>But though peevishness may sometimes claim our
compassion, as the consequence or concomitant of
misery, it is very often found, where nothing can

<pb n="116"/>

justify or excuse its admission.  It is frequently one
of the attendants on the prosperous, and is
employed by insolence in exacting homage, or by
tyranny in harassing subjection.  It is the offspring
of idleness or pride; of idleness anxious for trifles;
or pride unwilling to endure the least obstruction
of her wishes.  Those who have long lived in solitude
indeed naturally contract this unsocial quality,
because, having long had only themselves to please,
they do not readily depart from their own inclinations;
their singularities therefore are only blameable,
when they have imprudently or morosely
withdrawn themselves from the world; but there
are others, who have, without any necessity, nursed
up this habit in their minds, by making implicit
submissiveness the condition of their favour, and
suffering none to approach them, but those who
never speak but to applaud, or move but to obey.
</p>

<p>He that gives himself up to his own fancy, and
converses with none but such as he hires to lull him
on the down of absolute authority, to sooth him
with obsequiousness, and regale him with flattery,
soon grows too slothful for the labour of contest,
too tender for the asperity of contradiction, and too
delicate for the coarseness of truth; a little opposition
offends, a little restraint enrages, and a little
difficulty perplexes him; having been accustomed
to see every thing give way to his humour, he soon
forgets his own littleness, and expects to find the
world rolling at his beck, and all mankind employed
to accommodate and delight him.

<pb n="117"/>

</p>

<p>Tetrica had a large fortune bequeathed to her by
an aunt, which made her very early independent,
and placed her in a state of superiority to all about
her.  Having no superfluity of understanding, she
was soon intoxicated by the flatteries of her maid,
who informed her that ladies, such as she, had
nothing to do but take pleasure their own way;
that she wanted nothing from others, and had
therefore no reason to value their opinion; that
money was every thing and that they who thought
themselves ill-treated, should look for better usage
among their equals.
</p>

<p>Warm with these generous sentiments, Tetrica
came forth into the world, in which she endeavoured
to force respect by haughtiness of mien and
vehemence of language; but having neither birth,
beauty, nor wit, in any uncommon degree, she
suffered such mortifications from those who thought
themselves at liberty to return her insults, as
reduced her turbulence to cooler malignity, and
taught her to practise her arts of vexation only
where she might hope to tyrannize without resistance.
She continued from her twentieth to her
fifty-fifth year to torment all her inferiors with so
much diligence, that she has formed a principle of
disapprobation, and finds in every place something
to grate her mind, and disturb her quiet.
</p>

<p>If she takes the air, she is offended with the heat
or cold, the glare of the sun, or the gloom of the
clouds; if she makes a visit, the room in which she
is to be received is too light, or too dark, or furnished

<pb n="118"/>

with something which she cannot see without aversion.
Her tea is never of the right sort; the figures
on the China give her disgust.  Where there are
children, she hates the gabble of brats; where there
are none, she cannot bear a place without some
cheerfulness and rattle.  If many servants are kept
in a house, she never fails to tell how lord Lavish
was ruined by a numerous retinue; if few, she relates
the story of a miser that made his company
wait on themselves.  She quarrelled with one family,
because she had an unpleasant view from their
windows; with another, because the squirrel leaped
within two yards of her; and with a third, because
she could not bear the noise of the parrot.
</p>

<p>Of milliners and mantua-makers she is the proverbial
torment.  She compels them to alter their work,
then to unmake it, and contrive it after another
fashion; then changes her mind, and likes it better
as it was at first; then will have a small improvement.
Thus she proceeds till no profit can recompense
the vexation; they at last leave the clothes at her
house, and refuse to serve her.  Her maid, the only
being who can endure her tyranny, professes to take
her own course, and hear her mistress talk.  Such is
the consequence of peevishness; it can be borne only
when it is despised.
</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that too close an attention
to minute exactness, or a too rigorous habit of examining
every thing by the standard of perfection,
vitiates the temper, rather than improves the
understanding, and teaches the mind to discern faults

<pb n="119"/>

with unhapyy{sic} penetration.  It is incident likewise to
men of vigorous imagination to please themselves
too much with futurities, and to fret because those
expectations are disappointed, which should never
have been formed.  Knowledge and genius are often
enemies to quiet, by suggesting ideas of excellence,
which men and the performances of men cannot
attain.  But let no man rashly determine, that his
unwillingness to be pleased is a proof of understanding,
unless his superiority appears from less doubtful
evidence; for though peevishness may sometimes
justly boast its descent from learning or from wit,
it is much oftener of a base extraction, the child
of vanity and nursling of ignorance.

whose opinions are the result, not of solitary
conjectures, but of practice and experience.
</p>

<p>I was born to a large fortune, and bred to the
knowledge of those arts which are supposed to
accomplish the mind, and adorn the person of a
woman.  To these attainments, which custom and
education almost forced upon me, I added some
voluntary acquisitions by the use of books, and the
conversation of that species of men whom the ladies
generally mention with terrour and aversion under
the name of scholars, but whom I have found a
harmless and inoffensive order of beings, not so
much wiser than ourselves, but that they may receive
as well as communicate knowledge, and more inclined
to degrade their own character by cowardly
submission, than to overbear or oppress us with
their learning or their wit.
</p>

<p>From these men, however, if they are by kind
treatment encouraged to talk, something may be
gained, which, embellished with elegancy, and softened
by modesty, will always add dignity and value
to female conversation; and from my acquaintance
with the bookish part of the world I derived many
principles of judgment and maxims of prudence, by
which I was enabled to draw upon myself the general
regard in every place of concourse or pleasure.
My opinion was the great rule of approbation, my
remarks were remembered by those who desired
the second degree of fame, my mien was studied,
my dress was imitated, my letters were handed from
one family to another, and read by those who copied

<pb n="121"/>

them as sent to themselves; my visits were solicited
as honours, and multitudes boasted of an intimacy
with Melissa, who had only seen me by accident,
and whose familiarity had never proceeded beyond
the exchange of a compliment, or return of a
courtesy.
</p>

<p>I shall make no scruple of confessing that I was
pleased with this universal veneration, because I always
considered it as paid to my intrinsick qualities
and inseparable merit, and very easily persuaded
myself that fortune had no part in my superiority.
When I looked upon my glass, I saw youth and
beauty, with health that might give me reason to
hope their continuance; when I examined my mind,
I found some strength of judgment, and fertility of
fancy; and was told that every action was grace,
and that every accent was persuasion.
</p>

<p>In this manner my life passed like a continual
triumph amidst acclamations, and envy, and courtship,
and caresses: to please Melissa was the general
ambition, and every stratagem of artful flattery was
practised upon me.  To be flattered is grateful, even
when we know that our praises are not believed by
those who pronounce them; for they prove, at least,
our power, and shew that our favour is valued,
since it is purchased by the meanness of falsehood.
But, perhaps, the flatterer is not often detected, for
an honest mind is not apt to suspect, and no one
exerts the power of discernment with much vigour
when self-love favours the deceit.
</p>

<p>The number of adorers, and the perpetual dis-
<pb n="122"/>

traction of my thoughts by new schemes of pleasure,
prevented me from listening to any of those who
crowd in multitudes to give girls advice, and keep
me unmarried and unengaged to my twenty-seventh
year, when, as I was towering in all the pride of
uncontested excellency, with a face yet little impaired,
and a mind hourly improving, the failure
of a fund, in which my money was placed, reduced
me to a frugal competency, which allowed little
beyond neatness and independence.
</p>

<p>I bore the diminution of my riches without any
outrages of sorrow, or pusillanimity of dejection.
Indeed I did not know how much I had lost, for;
having always heard and thought more of my wit
and beauty, than of my fortune, it did not suddenly
enter my imagination, that Melissa could sink
beneath her established rank, while her form and
her mind continued the same; that she could cease
to raise admiration but by ceasing to deserve it, or
feel any stroke but from the hand of time.
</p>

<p>It was in my power to have concealed the loss, and
to have married, by continuing the same appearance,
with all the credit of my original fortune; but I
was not so far sunk in my own esteem, as to submit
to the baseness of fraud, or to desire any other
recommendation than sense and virtue.  I therefore
dismissed my equipage, sold those ornaments which
were become unsuitable to my new condition, and
appeared among those with whom I used to converse
with less glitter, but with equal spirit.
</p>

<p>I found myself received at every visit, with sor-
<pb n="123"/>

row beyond what is naturally felt for calamities in
which we have no part, and was entertained with
condolence and consolation so frequently repeated,
that my friends plainly consulted rather their own
gratification, than my relief. Some from that time
refused my acquaintance, and forbore, without any
provocation, to repay my visits; some visited me,
but after a longer interval than usual, and every
return was still with more delay, nor did any of my
female acquaintances fail to introduce the mention
of my misfortunes, to compare my present and
former condition, to tell me how much it must
trouble me to want the splendour which I became
so well, to look at pleasures which I had formerly
enjoyed, and to sink to a level with those by whom
I had been considered as moving in a higher sphere,
and who had hitherto approached me with reverence
and submission, which I was now no longer to
expect.
</p>

<p>Observations like these, are commonly nothing
better than covert insults, which serve to give vent
to the flatulence of pride, but they are now and
then imprudently uttered by honesty and benevolence,
and inflict pain where kindness is intended,
I will, therefore, so far maintain my antiquated
claim to politeness, as to venture the establishment
of this rule, that no one ought to remind another
of misfortunes of which the sufferer does not complain,
and which there are no means proposed of
alleviating.  You have no right to excite thoughts
which necessarily give pain whenever they return,

<pb n="124"/>

and which perhaps might not have revived but by
absurd and unseasonable compassion.
</p>

<p>My endless train of lovers immediately withdrew,
without raising any emotions.  The greater part had
indeed always professed to court, as it is termed,
upon the square, had inquired my fortune, and
offered settlements; these had undoubtedly a right
to retire without censure, since they had openly
treated for money, as necessary to their happiness,
and who can tell how little they wanted any other
portion? I have always thought the clamours of
women unreasonable, who imagine themselves injured
because the men who followed them upon the
supposition of a greater fortune, reject them when
they are discovered to have less.  I have never known
any lady, who did not think wealth a title to some
stipulations in her favour; and surely what is claimed
by the possession of money is justly forfeited by its
loss.  She that has once demanded a settlement has
allowed the importance of fortune: and when she
cannot shew pecuniary merit, why should she think
her cheapener obliged to purchase?
</p>

<p>My lovers were not all contented with silent
desertion.  Some of them revenged the neglect which
they had formerly endured by wanton and superfluous
insults, and endeavoured to mortify me, by
paying, in my presence, those civilities to other
ladies, which were once devoted only to me.  But,
as it had been my rule to treat men according to the
rank of their intellect, I had never suffered any one
to waste his life in suspense, who could have em-
<pb n="125"/>

ployed it to better purpose, and had therefore no
enemies but coxcombs, whose resentment and respect
were equally below my consideration.
</p>

<p>The only pain which I have felt from degradation,
is the loss of that influence which I had always
exerted on the side of virtue, in the defence of
innocence, and the assertion of truth.  I now find my
opinions slighted, my sentiments criticised, and my
arguments opposed by those that used to listen to
me without reply, and struggle to be first in expressing
their conviction.
</p>

<p>The female disputants have wholly thrown off
my authority; and if I endeavour to enforce my
reasons by an appeal to the scholars that happen to
present, the wretches are certain to pay their court
by sacrificing me and my system to a finer gown,
and I am every hour insulted with contradiction by
cowards, who could never find till lately that Melissa
was liable to errour.
</p>

<p>There are two persons only whom I cannot charge
with having changed their conduct with my change
of fortune.  One is an old curate that has passed his
life in the duties of his profession, with great reputation
for his knowledge and piety; the other is a
lieutenant of dragoons.  The parson made no difflculty
in the height of my elevation to check me
when I was pert, and instruct me when I blundered;
and if there is any alteration, he is now more timorous,
lest his freedom should be thought rudeness.
The soldier never paid me any particular addresses,
but very rigidly observed all the rules of politeness,

<pb n="126"/>

which he is now so far from relaxing, that whenever
he serves the tea, he obstinately carries me the first
dish, in defiance of the frowns and whispers of the
table.
</p>

<p>This, Mr. Rambler, is to <hi rend="italic">see the world</hi>.  It
is impossible for those that have only known affluence
and prosperity, to judge of themselves or others.
The rich and the powerful live in a perpetual
masquerade, in which all about them wear borrowed
characters; and we only discover in what estimation
we are held, when we can no longer give hopes or
fears.

</epigraph>

<p>IT is easy for every man, whatever be his character
with others, to find reasons for esteeming
himself, and therefore censure, contempt, or conviction
of crimes, seldom deprive him of his own
favour.  Those, indeed, who can see only external
facts, may look upon him with abhorrence? but
when he calls himself to his own tribunal, he finds
every fault, if not absolutely effaced, yet so much
palliated by the goodness of his intention, and the

<pb n="127"/>

cogency of the motive, that very little guilt or
turpitude remains; and when he takes a survey of
the whole complication of his character, he discovers
so many latent excellencies, so many virtues that
want but an opportunity to exert themselves in act,
and so many kind wishes for universal happiness,
that he looks on himself as suffering unjustly under
the infamy of single failings, while the general temper
of his mind is unknown or unregarded.
</p>

<p>It is natural to mean well, when only abstracted
ideas of virtue are proposed to the mind, and no
particular passion turns us aside from rectitude; and
so willing is every man to flatter himself, that the
difference between approving laws, and obeying
them, is frequently forgotten; he that acknowledges
the obligations of morality, and pleases his vanity
with enforcing them to others, concludes himself
zealous in the cause of virtue, though he has no
longer any regard to her precepts, than they conform
to his own desire; and counts himself among
her warmest lovers, because he praises her beauty,
though every rival steals away his heart.
</p>

<p>There are, however, great numbers who have
little recourse to the refinements of speculation, but
who yet live at peace with themselves, by means
which require less understanding, or less attention.
When their hearts are burthened with the consciousness
of a crime, instead of seeking for some
remedy within themselves, they look round upon
the rest of mankind, to finds others tainted with
the same guilt: they please themselves with observ-
<pb n="128"/>

ing, that they have numbers on their side; and that,
though they are hunted out from the society of good
men, they are not likely to be condemned to solitude.
</p>

<p>It may be observed, perhaps without exception,
that none are so industrious to detect wickedness,
or so ready to impute it, as they whose crimes are
apparent and confessed.  They envy an unblemished
reputation, and what they envy they are busy to
destroy; they are unwilling to suppose themselves
meaner and more corrupt than others, and therefore
willingly pull down from their elevations those
with whom they cannot rise to an equality.  No man
yet was ever wicked without secret discontent, and
according to the different degrees of remaining
virtue, or unextinguished reason, he either endeavours
to reform himself, or corrupt others; either to
regain the station which he has quitted, or prevail
on others to imitate his defection.
</p>

<p>It has always been considered as an alleviation of
misery not to suffer alone, even when union and
society can contribute nothing to resistance or escape;
some comfort of the same kind seems to incite
wickedness to seek associates, though indeed another
reason may be given, for as guilt is propagated
the power of reproach is diminished, and among
numbers equally detestable every individual may be
sheltered from shame, though not from conscience.
</p>

<p>Another lenitive by which the throbs of the breast
are assuaged, is, the contemplation, not of the same
but of different crimes.  He that cannot justify himself
by his resemblance to others, is ready to try

<pb n="129"/>

some other expedient, and to inquire what will rise
to his advantage from opposition and dissimilitude.
He easily finds some faults in every human being,
which he weighs against his own, and easily makes
them preponderate while he keeps the balance in
his own hand, and throws in or takes out at his
pleasure circumstances that makes them heavier or
lighter.  He then triumphs in his comparative purity,
and sets himself at ease, not because he can refute
the charges advanced against him, but because he
can censure his accusers with equal justice, and no
longer fears the arrows of reproach, when he has
stored his magazine of malice with weapons equally
sharp and equally envenomed.
</p>

<p>This practice, though never just, is yet specious
and artful, when the censure is directed against
deviations to the contrary extreme.  The man who is
branded with cowardice, may, with some appearance
of propriety, turn all his force of argument against
a stupid contempt of life, and rash precipitation
into unnecessary danger.  Every recession from temerity
is an approach towards cowardice, and though
it be confessed that bravery, like other virtues,
stands between faults on either hand, yet the place
of the middle point may always be disputed; he
may therefore often impose upon careless
understandings, by turning the attention wholly from
himself, and keeping it fixed invariably on the
opposite fault; and by shewing how many evils are
avoided by his behavior, he may conceal for a time
those which are incurred.

<pb n="130"/>

</p>

<p>But vice has not always opportunities or address
for such artful subterfuges; men often extenuate
their own guilt, only by vague and general charges
upon others, or endeavour to gain rest to themselves,
by pointing some other prey to the pursuit
of censure.
</p>

<p>Every whisper of infamy is industriously circulated,
every hint of suspicion eagerly improved, and
every failure of conduct joyfully published, by those
whose interest it is, that the eye and voice of the
publick should be employed on any rather than on
themselves.
</p>

<p>All these artifices, and a thousand others equally
vain and equally despicable, are incited by that conviction
of the deformity of wickedness, from which
none can set himself free, and by an absurd desire
to separate the cause from the effects, and to enjoy
the profit of crimes without suffering the shame.
Men are willing to try all methods of reconciling
guilt and quiet, and when their understandings are
stubborn and uncomplying, raise their passions
against them, and hope to overpower their own
knowledge.
</p>

<p>It is generally not so much the desire of men,
sunk into depravity, to deceive the world as themselves,
for when no particular circumstances make
them dependent on others, infamy disturbs them
little, but as it revives their remorse, and is echoed
to them from their own hearts.  The sentence most
dreaded is that of reason and conscience, which they
would engage on their side at any price but the

<pb n="131"/>

labours of duty, and the sorrows of repentance.
For this purpose every seducement and fallacy is
sought, the hopes still rest upon some new experiment
till life is at an end; and the last hour steals
on unperceived, while the faculties are engaged in
resisting reason, and repressing the sense of the
Divine disapprobation.

</epigraph>

<p>AMONG those, whose hopes of distinction, or
riches, arise from an opinion of their intellectual
attainments, it has been, from age to age, an
established custom to complain of the ingratitude
of mankind to their instructors, and the discouragement
which men of genius and study suffer from
avarice and ignorance, from the prevalence of false
taste, and the encroachment of barbarity.
</p>

<p>Men are most powerfully affected by those evils
which themselves feel, or which appear before their
own eyes; and as there has never been a time of
such general felicity, but that many have failed to
obtain the rewards to which they had, in their own
judgment, a just claim, some offended writer has
always declaimed, in the rage of disappointment,

<pb n="132"/>

against his age or nation; nor is there one who has
not fallen upon times more unfavourable to learning
than any former century, or who does not wish,
that he had been reserved in the insensibility of
non-existence to some happier hour, when literary
merit shall no longer be despised, and the gifts and
caresses of mankind shall recompense the toils of
study, and add lustre to the charms of wit.
</p>

<p>Many of these clamours are undoubtedly to be
considered only as the bursts of pride never to be
satisfied, as the prattle of affectation, mimicking
distresses unfelt, or as the common places of vanity
solicitous for splendour of sentences, and acuteness
of remark.  Yet it cannot be denied that frequent
discontent must proceed from frequent hardships,
and though it is evident, that not more than one
age or people can deserve the censure of being more
averse from learning than any other, yet at all times
knowledge must have encountered impediments,
and wit been mortified with contempt, or harassed
with persecution.
</p>

<p>It is not necessary, however, to join immediately
in the outcry, or to condemn mankind as pleased
with ignorance, or always envious of superior abilities.
The miseries of the learned have been related
by themselves, and since they have not been found
exempt from that partiality with which men look
upon their own actions and sufferings, we may conclude
that they have not forgotten to deck their
cause with the brightest ornaments, and strongest
colours.  The logician collected all his subtilties

<pb n="133"/>

when they were to be employed in his own defence;
and the master of rhetorick exerted against his
adversary all the arts by which hatred is embittered,
and indignation inflamed.
</p>

<p>To believe no man in his own cause, is the standing
and perpetual rule of distributive justice.  Since
therefore, in the controversy between the learned
and their enemies, we have only the pleas of one
party, of the party more able to delude our
understandings, and engage our passions, we must
determine our opinion by facts uncontested, and
evidences on each side allowed to be genuine.
</p>

<p>By this procedure, I know not whether the
students will find their cause promoted, or the
compassion which they expect much increased.  Let
their conduct be impartially surveyed; let them be
allowed no longer to direct attention at their pleasure,
by expatiating on their own deserts; let neither
the dignity of knowledge overawe the judgment,
nor the graces of elegance seduce it.  It will then,
perhaps, be found, that they were not able to
produce claims to kinder treatment, but provoked
the calamities which they suffered, and seldom
wanted friends, but when they wanted virtue.
</p>

<p>That few men, celebrated for theoretick wisdom,
live with conformity to their precepts, must be
readily confessed; and we cannot wonder that the
indignation of mankind rises with great vehemence
against those, who neglect the duties which they
appear to know with so strong conviction the necessity
of performing.  Yet since no man has power of

<pb n="184"/>

acting equal to that of thinking, I know not whether
the speculatist may not sometimes incur censures
too severe, and by those who form ideas of his life
from their knowledge of his books, be considered
as worse than others, only because he was expected
to be better.
</p>

<p>He, by whose writings the heart is rectified, the
appetites counteracted, and the passions repressed,
may be considered as not unprofitable to the great
republick of humanity, even though his behaviour
should not always exemplify his rules.  His instructions
may diffuse their influence to regions, in which
it will not be inquired, whether the author be <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">albus
an ater</hi></foreign>, good or bad; to times, when all his faults
and all his follies shall be lost in forgetfulness, among
things of no concern or importance to the world;
and he may kindle in thousands and ten thousands
that flame which burnt but dimly in himself, through
the fumes of passion, or the damps of cowardice.
The vicious moralist may be considered as a taper,
by which we are lighted through the labyrinth
of complicated passions: he extends his radiance
further than his heat, and guides all that are within
view, but burns only those who make too near
approaches.
</p>

<p>Yet since good or harm must be received for the
most part from those to whom we are familiarly
known, he whose vices overpower his virtues, in
the compass to which his vices can extend, has no
reason to complain that he meets not with affection
or veneration, when those with whom he passes his

<pb n="135"/>

life are more corrupted by his practice than enlightened
by his ideas.  Admiration begins where acquaintance
ceases; and his favourers are distant, but
his enemies at hand.
</p>

<p>Yet many have dared to boast of neglected merit,
and to challenge their age for cruelty and folly, of
whom it cannot be alledged that they have endeavoured
to increase the wisdom or virtue of their
readers.  They have been at once profligate in their
lives, and licentious in their compositions; have not
only forsaken the paths of virtue, but attempted to
lure others after them.  They have smoothed the
road of perdition, covered with flowers the thorns
of guilt, and taught temptation sweeter notes, softer
blandishments, and stronger allurements.
</p>

<p>It has been apparently the settled purpose of some
writers, whose powers and acquisitions place them
high in the rank of literature, to set fashion on the
side of wickedness; to recommend debauchery and
lewdness, by associating them with qualities most
likely to dazzle the discernment, and attract the
affections; and to shew innocence and goodness with
such attendant weaknesses as necessarily expose
them to contempt and derision.
</p>

<p>Such naturally found intimates among the corrupt,
the thoughtless, and the intemperate; passed
their lives amidst the levities of sportive idleness,
or the warm professions of drunken friendship; and
fed their hopes with the promises of wretches, whom
their precepts had taught to scoff at truth.  But
when fools had laughed away their sprightliness,

<pb n="136"/>

and the languors of excess could no longer be relieved,
they saw their protectors hourly drop away,
and wondered and stormed to find themselves
abandoned.  Whether their companions persisted in
wickedness, or returned to virtue, they were left
equally without assistance; for debauchery is selfish
and negligent, and from virtue the virtuous only can
expect regard.
</p>

<p>It is said by Florus of Catiline, who died in the
midst of slaughtered enemies, that <hi rend="italic">his death had been
illustrious, had it been suffered for his country</hi>.  Of the
wits who have languished away life under the pressures
of poverty, or in the restlessness of suspense,
caressed and rejected, flattered and despised, as they
were of more or less use to those who styled themselves
their patrons, it might be observed, that their
miseries would enforce compassion, had they been
brought upon them by honesty and religion.
</p>

<p>The wickedness of a loose or profane author is
more atrocious than that of the giddy libertine, or
drunken ravisher, not only because it extends its
effects wider, as a pestilence that taints the air is
more destructive than poison infused in a draught,
but because it is committed with cool deliberation.
By the instantaneous violence of desire, a good
man may sometimes be surprised before reflection
can come to his rescue; when the appetites have
strengthened their influence by habit, they are not
easily resisted or suppressed; but for the frigid
villainy of studious lewdness, for the calm malignity
of laboured impiety, what apology can be invented?

<pb n="137"/>

What punishment can be adequate to the crime of
him who retires to solitudes for the refinement of
debauchery; who tortures his fancy, and ramsacks
his memory, only that he may leave the world less
virtuous than he found it; that he may intercept
the hopes of the rising generation; and spread snares
for the soul with more dexterity?
</p>

<p>What were their motives, or what their excuses,
is below the dignity of reason to examine.  If having
extinguished in themselves the distinction of right
and wrong, they were insensible of the mischief
which they promoted, they deserved to be hunted
down by the general compact, as no longer partaking
of social nature; if influenced by the corruption
of patrons, or readers, they sacrificed their own convictions
to vanity or interest, they were to be abhorred
with more acrimony than he that murders
for pay; since they committed greater crimes without
greater temptations.
</p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Of him, to whom much is given, much shall be
required</hi>.
Those, whom God has favoured with superior
faculties, and made eminent for quickness of
intuition, and accuracy of distinctions, will certainly
be regarded as culpable in his eye, for defects and
deviations which, in souls less enlightened, may be
guiltless.  But, surely, none can think without horrour
on that man's condition, who has been more wicked
in proportion as he had more means of excelling in
virtue, and used the light imparted from heaven
only to embellish folly, and shed lustre upon crimes.

<p>CORPORAL sensation is known to depend so
much upon novelty, that custom takes away
from many things their power of giving pleasure
or pain.  Thus a new dress becomes easy by wearing
it, and the palate is reconciled by degrees to
dishes which at first disgusted it.  That by long
habit of carrying a burden, we loose, in great part,
our sensibility of its weight, any man may be convinced
by putting on for an hour the armour of our
ancestors; for he will scarcely believe that men
would have had much inclination to marches and
battles, encumbered and oppressed, as he will find
himself, with the ancient panoply.  Yet the heroes
that overran regions, and stormed towns in iron
accoutrements, he knows not to have been bigger,
and has no reason to imagine them stronger, than
the present race of men; he therefore must conclude,
that their peculiar powers were conferred only by
peculiar habits, and that their familiarity with the
dress of war enabled them to move in it with ease,
vigour, and agility.
</p>

<p>Yet it seems to be the condition of our present
state, that pain should be more fixed and permanent
than pleasure.  Uneasiness gives way by slow degrees,
and is long before it quits its possession of

<pb n="139"/>

the sensory; but all our gratifications are volatile,
vagrant, and easily dissipated.  The fragrance of the
jessamine bower is lost after the enjoyment of a few
moments, and the Indian wanders among his native
spices without any sense of their exhalations.  It is,
indeed, not necessary to shew by many instances
what all mankind confess, by an incessant call for
variety, and restless pursuit of enjoyments, which
they value only because unpossessed.
</p>

<p>Something similar, or analogous, may be observed
in effects produced immediately upon the
mind; nothing can strongly strike or affect us, but
what is rare or sudden.  The most important events,
when they become familiar, are no longer considered
with wonder or solicitude, and that which
at first filled up our whole attention, and left no
place for any other thought, is soon thrust aside
into some remote repository of the mind, and lies
among other lumber of the memory, overlooked
and neglected.  Thus far the mind resembles the
body, but here the similitude is at an end.
</p>

<p>The manner in which external force acts upon the
body is very little subject to the regulation of the
will; no man can at pleasure obtund or invigorate
his senses, prolong the agency of any impulse, or
continue the presence of any image traced upon the
eye, or any sound infused into the ear.  But our
ideas are more subjected to choice; we can call
them before us, and command their stay, we can
facilitate and promote their recurrence, we can
either repress their intrusion, or hasten their retreat.

<pb n="140"/>

It is therefore the business of wisdom and virtue, to
select among numberless objects striving for our
notice, such as may enable us to exalt our reason,
extend our views, and secure our happiness.  But this
choice is to be made with very little regard to rareness
or frequency; for nothing is valuable merely
because it is either rare or common, but because it
is adapted to some useful purpose, and enables us
to supply some deficiency of our nature.
</p>

<p>Milton has judiciously represented the father of
mankind, as seized with horrour and astonishment
at the sight of death, exhibited to him on the mount
of vision.  For surely, nothing can so much disturb
the passions, or perplex the intellects of man, as the
disruption of his union with visible nature; a
separation from all that has hitherto delighted or
engaged him; a change not only of the place,
but the manner of his being; an entrance into a
state not simply which he knows not, but which
perhaps he has not faculties to know; an immediate
and perceptible communication with the
supreme Being, and, what is above all distressful
and alarming, the final sentence, and unalterable
allotment.
</p>

<p>Yet we to whom the shortness of life has given
frequent occasions of contemplating mortality, can,
without emotion, see generations of men pass away,
and are at leisure to establish modes of sorrow, and
adjust the ceremonial of death.  We can look upon
funeral pomp as a common spectacle in which we
have no concern, and turn away from it to trifles

<pb n="141"/>

and amusements, without dejection of look, or inquietude
of heart.
</p>

<p>It is, indeed, apparent, from the constitution of
the world, that there must be a time for other
thoughts; and a perpetual meditation upon the last
hour, however it may become the solitude of a monastery,
is inconsistent with many duties of common
life.  But surely the remembrance of death ought to
predominate in our minds, as an habitual and settled
principle, always operating, though not always
perceived; and our attention should seldom wander so
far from our own condition, as not to be recalled
and fixed by sight of an event, which must soon,
we know not how soon, happen likewise to ourselves,
and of which, though we cannot appoint the time,
we may secure the consequence.
</p>

<p>Every instance of death may justly awaken our
fears and quicken our vigilance; but its frequency
so much weakens its effect, that we are seldom
alarmed unless some close connexion is broken,
some scheme frustrated, or some hope defeated.
Many therefore seem to pass on from youth to decrepitude
without any reflection on the end of life,
because there are wholly involved within themselves,
and look on others only as inhabitants of the common
earth, without any expectation of receiving good,
or intention of bestowing it.
</p>

<p>Events, of which we confess the importance,
excite little sensibility, unless they affect us more
nearly than as sharers in the common interest of
mankind; that desire which every man feels of being

<pb n="142"/>

remembered and lamented, is often mortified when
we remark how little concern is caused by the eternal
departure even of those who have passed their lives
with publick honours, and been distinguished by
extraordinary performances.  It is not possible to be
regarded with tenderness except by a few.  That
merit which gives greatness and renown, diffuses
its influence to a wide compass, but acts weakly on
every single breast; it is placed at a distance from
common spectators, and shines like one of the remote
stars, of which the light reaches us, but not
the heat.  The wit, the hero, the philosopher, whom
their tempers or their fortunes have hindered from
intimate relations, die, without any other effect
than that of adding a new topic to the conversation
of the day.  They impress none with any fresh conviction
of the fragility of our nature, because none
had any particular interest in their lives, or was
united to them by a reciprocation of benefits and
endearments.
</p>

<p>Thus it oftens happens, that those who in their
lives were applauded and admired, are laid at last
in the ground without the common honour of a
stone; because by those excellencies with which
many were delighted, none had been obliged, and
though they had many to celebrate, they had none
to love them.
</p>

<p>Custom so far regulates the sentiments, at least
of common minds, that I believe men may be generally
observed to grow less tender as they advance
in age.  He, who, when life was new, melted at the

<pb n="143"/>

loss of every companion, can look in time, without
concern, upon the grave into which his last friend
was thrown, and into which himself is ready to fall;
not that he is more willing to die than formerly,
but that he is more familiar to the death of others,
and therefore is not alarmed so far as to consider
how much nearer he approaches to his end.  But this
is to submit tamely to the tyranny of accident, and
to suffer our reason to lie useless.  Every funeral may
justly be considered as a summons to prepare for
that state, into which it shews us that we must
some time enter; and the summons is more loud
and piercing, as the event of which it warns us is at
less distance.  To neglect at any time preparation for
death, is to sleep on our post at a siege; but to omit
it in old age, is to sleep at an attack.
</p>

<p>It has always appeared to me one of the most
striking passages in the Visions of Quevedo, which
stigmatises those as fools who complain that they
failed of happiness by sudden death.  "How," says
he, "can death be sudden to a being who always
knew that he must die, and that the time of his
death was uncertain?"
</p>

<p>Since business and gaiety are always drawing our
attention away from a future state, some admonition
is frequently necessary to recall it to our minds;
and what can more properly renew the impression
than the examples of mortality which every day
supplies? The great incentive to virtue is the reflection
that we must die; it will therefore be useful
to accustom ourselves, whenever we see a funeral,

<pb n="144"/>

to consider how soon we may be added to the
number of those whose probation is past, and whose
happiness or misery shall endure for ever<ref

<p>SUSPICION, however necessary it may be to
our safe passage through ways beset on all
sides by fraud and malice, has been always considered,
when it exceeds the common measures, as
a token of depravity and corruption; and a Greek
writer of sentences has laid down as a standing
maxim, that <hi rend="italic">he who believes not another on his oath,
knows himself to be perjured</hi>.
</p>

<p>We can form our opinions of that which we
know not, only by placing it in comparison with
something that we know; whoever, therefore, is
over-run with suspicion, and detects artifice and
stratagem in every proposal, must either have
learned by experience or observation the wickedness
of mankind, and been taught to avoid fraud
by having often suffered or seen treachery, or he

<pb n="145"/>

must derive his judgment from the consciousness
of his own disposition, and impute to others the
same inclinations, which he feels predominant in
himself.
</p>

<p>To learn caution by turning our eyes upon life,
and observing the arts by which negligence is surprized,
timidity overborne, and credulity amused,
requires either great latitude of converse and long
acquaintance with business, or uncommon activity
of vigilance, and acuteness of penetration.  When,
therefore, a young man, not distinguished by vigour
of intellect, comes into the world full of scruples
and diffidence; makes a bargain with many provisional
limitations; hesitates in his answer to a common
question, lest more should be intended than he
can immediately discover; has a long reach in detecting
the projects of his acquaintance; considers every
caress as an act of hypocrisy, and feels neither
gratitude nor affection from the tenderness of his
friends, because he believes no one to have any real
tenderness but for himself; whatever expectations
this early sagacity may raise of his future eminence
or riches, I can seldom forbear to consider him as a
wretch incapable of generosity or benevolence; as
a villain early completed beyond the need of common
opportunities and gradual temptations.
</p>

<p>Upon men of this class instruction and admonition
are generally thrown away, because they consider
artifice and deceit as proofs of understanding,
they are misled at the same time by the two great
seducers of the world, vanity and interest, and not

<pb n="146"/>

only look upon those who act with openness and
confidence, as condemned by their principles to
obscurity and want, but as contemptible for narrowness
of comprehension, shortness of views, and
slowness of contrivance.
</p>

<p>The world has been long amused with the mention
of policy in publick transactions, and of art in
private affairs; they have been considered as the
effects of great qualities, and as unattainable by
men of the common level: yet I have not found
many performances either of art or policy, that required
such stupendous efforts of intellect, or might
not have been effected by falsehood and impudence,
without the assistance of any other powers.  To
profess what he does not mean, to promise what he
cannot perform, to flatter ambition with prospects
of promotion, and misery with hopes of relief, to
sooth pride with appearances of submission, and
appease enmity by blandishments and bribes, can
surely imply nothing more or greater than a mind
devoted wholly to its own purposes, a face that
cannot blush, and a heart that cannot feel.
</p>

<p>These practices are so mean and base, that he
who finds in himself no tendency to use them, cannot
easily believe that they are considered by others
with less detestation; he therefore suffers himself
to slumber in false security, and becomes a prey to
those who applaud their own subtilty, because they
know how to steal upon his sleep, and exult in the
success which they could never have obtained, had
they not attempted a man better than themselves,

<pb n="147"/>

who was hindered from obviating their stratagems,
not by folly, but by innocence.
</p>

<p>Suspicion is, indeed, a temper so uneasy and
restless, that it is very justly appointed the concomitant
of guilt.  It is said, that no torture is equal
to the inhibition of sleep long continued; a pain, to
which the state of that man bears a very exact
analogy, who dares never give rest to his vigilance
and circumspection, but considers himself as surrounded
by secret foes, and fears to entrust his
children, or his friend, with the secret that throbs
in his breast, and the anxieties that break into his
face.  To avoid, at this expense, those evils to which
easiness and friendship might have exposed him, is
surely to buy safety at too dear a rate, and, in the
language of the Roman satirist, to save life by losing
all for which a wise man would live<ref target="JohRamb.6">[u].</ref>
</p>

<note id="JohRamb.6"><seg type="note-symbol">[u]</seg> <p>Propter vitam vivendi perdere causas.</p></note>


<p>When in the diet of the German empire, as Camararius
relates, the princes were once displaying
their felicity, and each boasting the advantages of
his own dominions, one who possessed a country
not remarkable for the grandeur of its cities, or the
fertility of its soil, rose to speak, and the rest listened
between pity and contempt, till he declared, in
honour of his territories, that he could travel through
them without a guard, and if he was weary, sleep
in safety upon the lap of the first man whom he
should meet; a commendation which would have
been ill exchanged for the boast of palaces, pastures,
or streams.

<pb n="148"/>

</p>

<p>Suspicion is not less an enemy to virtue than to
happiness; he that is already corrupt is naturally
suspicious, and he that becomes suspicious will
quickly be corrupt.  It is too common for us to
learn the frauds by which ourselves have suffered;
men who are once persuaded that deceit will be
employed against them, sometimes think the same
arts justified by the necessity of defence.  Even they
whose virtue is too well established to give way to
example, or be shaken by sophistry, must yet feel
their love of mankind diminished with their esteem,
and grow less zealous for the happiness of those by
whom they imagine their own happiness endangered.
</p>

<p>Thus we find old age, upon which suspicion has
been strongly impressed, by long intercourse with
the world, inflexible and severe, not easily softened
by submission, melted by complaint, or subdued
by supplication.  Frequent experience of counterfeited
miseries, and dissembled virtue, in time overcomes
that disposition to tenderness and sympathy,
which is so powerful in our younger years; and they
that happen to petition the old for compassion or
assistance, are doomed to languish without regard,
and suffer for the crimes of men who have formerly
been found undeserving or ungrateful.
</p>

<p>Historians are certainly chargeable with the
depravation of mankind, when they relate without
censure those stratagems of war by which the virtues
of an enemy are engaged to his destruction.  A ship
comes before a port, weather beaten and shattered,
and the crew implore the liberty of repairing their

<pb n="149"/>

breaches, supplying themselves with necessaries, or
burying their dead.  The humanity of the inhabitants
inclines them to consent; the strangers enter
the town with weapons concealed, fall suddenly
upon their benefactors, destroy those that make
resistance, and become masters of the place; they
return home rich with plunder, and their success is
recorded to encourage imitation.
</p>

<p>But surely war has its laws, and ought to be conducted
with some regard to the universal interest
of man.  Those may justly be pursued as enemies to
the community of nature, who suffer hostility to
vacate the unalterable laws of right, and pursue their
private advantage by means, which, if once established,
must destroy kindness, cut off from every
man all hopes of assistance from another, and fill
the world with perpetual suspicion and implacable
malevolence.  Whatever is thus gained ought to be
restored, and those who have conquered by such
treachery may be justly denied the protection of
their native country.
</p>

<p>Whoever commits a fraud is guilty not only of
the particular injury to him whom he deceives, but
of the diminution of that confidence which constitutes
not only the ease but the existence of society.
He that suffers by imposture has too often his virtue
more impaired than his fortune.  But as it is necessary
not to invite robbery by supineness, so it is
our duty not to suppress tenderness by suspicion;
it is better to suffer wrong than to do it, and happier
to be sometimes cheated than not to trust.

</epigraph>

<p>AS Providence has made the human soul an active
being, always impatient for novelty, and struggling
for something yet unenjoyed with unwearied
progression, the world seems to have been eminently
adapted to this disposition of the mind; it is formed
to raise expectations by constant vicissitudes, and
to obviate satiety by perpetual change.
</p>

<p>Wherever we turn our eyes, we find something
to revive our curiosity, and engage our attention.
In the dusk of the morning we watch the rising of
the sun, and see the day diversify the clouds, and
open new prospects in its gradual advance.  After a
few hours, we see the shades lengthen, and the light
decline, till the sky is resigned to a multitude of
shining orbs different from each other in magnitude
and splendour.  The earth varies its appearance as we
move upon it; the woods offer their shades, and the
fields their harvests; the hill flatters with an extensive
view, and the valley invites with shelter, fragrance,
and flowers.
</p>

<p>The poets have numbered among the felicities of
the golden age, an exemption from the change of
seasons, and a perpetuity of spring; but I am not

<pb n="151"/>

certain that in this state of imaginary happiness they
have made sufficient provision for that insatiable
demand of new gratifications, which seem particularly
to characterize the nature of man.  Our sense
of delight is in a great measure comparative, and
arises at once from the sensations, which we feel,
and those which we remember.  Thus ease after
torment is pleasure for a time, and we are very
agreeably recreated, when the body, chilled with the
weather, is gradually recovering its natural tepidity;
but the joy ceases when we have forgot the cold:
we must fall below ease again, if we desire to rise
above it, and purchase new felicity by voluntary
pain.  It is therefore not unlikely, that however the
fancy may be amused with the description of regions
in which no wind is heard but the gentle zephyr, and
no scenes are displayed but valleys enamelled with
unfading flowers, and woods waving their perennial
verdure, we should soon grow weary of uniformity,
find our thoughts languish for want of other subjects,
call on heaven for our wonted round of seasons, and
think ourselves liberally recompensed for the
inconveniences of summer and winter, by new perceptions
of the calmness and mildness of the intermediate
variations.
</p>

<p>Every season has its particular power of striking
the mind.  The nakedness and asperity of the wintry
world always fill the beholder with pensive and profound
astonishment; as the variety of the scene is
lessened, its grandeur is increased; and the mind is
swelled at once by the mingled ideas of the present

<pb n="152"/>

and the past, of the beauties which have vanished
from the eyes, and the waste and desolation that
are now before them.
</p>

<p>It is observed by Milton, that he who neglects to
visit the country in spring, and rejects the pleasures
that are then in their first bloom and fragrance, is
guilty of <hi rend="italic">sullenness against nature</hi>  If we allot different
duties to different seasons, he may be charged
with equal disobedience to the voice of nature, who
looks on the bleak hills and leafless woods, without
seriousness and awe.  Spring is the season of gaiety,
and winter of terrour; in spring the heart of tranquillity
dances to the melody of the groves, and
the eye of benevolence sparkles at the sight of happiness
and plenty.  In the winter, compassion melts at
universal calamity, and the tear of softness starts at
the wailings of hunger, and the cries of the creation
in distress.
</p>

<p>Few minds have much inclination to indulge
heaviness and sorrow, nor do I recommend them
beyond the degree necessary to maintain in its full
vigour that habitual sympathy and tenderness,
which, in a world of so much misery, is necessary
to the ready discharge of our most important duties.
The winter, therefore, is generally celebrated as the
proper season for domestick merriment and gaiety.
We are seldom invited by the votaries of pleasure
to look abroad for any other purpose, than that we
may shrink back with more satisfaction to our
coverts, and when we have heard the howl of the
tempest, and felt the gripe of the frost, congratulate

<pb n="153"/>

each other with more gladness upon a close room,
an easy chair, a large fire, and a smoking dinner.
</p>

<p>Winter brings natural inducements to jollity and
conversation.  Differences, we know, are never so
effectually laid asleep, as by some common calamity.
An enemy unites all to whom he threatens danger.
The rigour of winter brings generally to the same
fire-side, those, who, by the opposition of
inclinations, or difference of employment, move in
various directions through the other parts of the
year; and when they have met, and find it their
mutual interest to remain together, they endear
each other by mutual compliances, and often wish
for the continuance of the social season, with all its
bleakness, and all its severities.
</p>

<p>To the men of study and imagination the winter
is generally the chief time of labour.  Gloom and
silence produce composure of mind, and concentration
of ideas; and the privation of external
pleasure naturally causes an effort to find
entertainment within.  This is the time in which those
whom literature enables to find amusements for
themselves, have more than common convictions
of their own happiness.  When they are condemned
by the elements to retirement, and debarred from
most of the diversions which are called in to assist
the flight of time, they can find new subjects of
inquiry, and preserve themselves from that weariness
which hangs always flagging upon the vacant mind.
</p>

<p>It cannot indeed be expected of all to be poets
and philosophers; it is necessary that the greater

<pb n="154"/>

part of mankind should be employed in the minute
business of common life; minute, indeed, not if we
consider its influence upon our happiness, but if we
respect the abilities requisite to conduct it.  These
must necessarily be more dependent on accident for
the means of spending agreeably those hours which
their occupations leave unengaged, or nature obliges
them to allow to relaxation.  Yet even on these I
would willingly impress such a sense of the value
of time, as may incline them to find out for their
careless hours amusements of more use and dignity
than the common games, which not only weary the
mind without improving it, but strengthen the
passions of envy and avarice, and often lead to fraud
and to profusion, to corruption and to ruin.  It is
unworthy of a reasonable being to spend any of the
little time allotted us, without some tendency, either
direct or oblique, to the end of our existence.  And
though every moment cannot be laid out on the
formal and regular improvement of our knowledge,
or in the stated practice of a moral or religious duty,
yet none should be so spent as to exclude wisdom
or virtue, or pass without possibility of qualifying
us more or less for the better employment of those
which are to come.
</p>

<p>It is scarcely possible to pass an hour in honest
conversation, without being able, when we rise from
it, to please ourselves with having given or received
some advantages; but a man may shuffle cards, or
rattle dice, from noon to midnight, without tracing
any new idea in his mind, or being able to recollect

<pb n="155"/>

the day by any other token than his gain or loss,
and a confused remembrance of agitated passions,
and clamorous altercations.
</p>

<p>However, as experience is of more weight than
precept, any of my readers, who are contriving how
to spend the dreary months before them, may consider
which of their past amusements fills them now
with the greatest satisfaction, and resolve to repeat
those gratifications of which the pleasure is most
durable.

</p>

</epigraph>

<p>AMONG questions which have been discussed,
without any approach to decision, may be
numbered the precedency or superior excellence of
one virtue to another, which has long furnished a
subject of dispute to men whose leisure sent them
out into the intellectual world in search of
employment, and who have, perhaps, been sometimes
withheld from the practice of their favourite duty,
by zeal for its advancement, and diligence in its
celebration.
</p>

<p>The intricacy of this dispute may be alleged as a
proof of that tenderness for mankind which Providence
has, I think, universally displayed, by making
attainments easy in proportion as they are
necessary.  That all the duties of morality ought to
be practised, is without difficulty discoverable, because
ignorance or uncertainty would immediately

<pb n="156"/>

involve the world in confusion and distress; but
which duty ought to be most esteemed, we may
continue to debate without inconvenience, so all be
diligently performed as there is opportunity or
need; for upon practice, not upon opinion, depends
the happiness of mankind; and controversies, merely
speculative, are of small importance in themselves,
however they may have sometimes heated a disputant,
or provoked a faction.
</p>

<p>Of the Divine Author of our religion it is impossible
to peruse the evangelical histories, without
observing how little he favoured the vanity of
inquisitiveness; how much more rarely he condescended
to satisfy curiosity, than to relieve distress;
and how much he desired that his followers should
rather excel in goodness than in knowledge.  His
precepts tend immediately to the rectification of the
moral principles, and the direction of daily conduct,
without ostentation, without art, at once
irrefragable and plain, such as well-meaning simplicity
may readily conceive, and of which we cannot
mistake the meaning, but when we are afraid
to find it.
</p>

<p>The measure of justice prescribed to us, in our
transactions with others, is remarkably clear and
comprehensive: <hi rend="italic">Whatsoever ye would that men should
do unto you, even so do unto them</hi>.  A law by which
every claim of right may be immediately adjusted
as far as the private conscience requires to be
informed; a law, of which every man may find the
exposition in his own breast, and which may always

<pb n="157"/>

be observed without any other qualifications than
honesty of intention, and purity of will.
</p>

<p>Over this law, indeed, some sons of sophistry have
been subtle enough to throw mists,which have darkened
their own eyes.  To perplex this universal principle,
they have inquired whether a man, conscious to
himself of unreasonable wishes, be bound to gratify
them in another.  But surely there needed no long
deliberation to conclude, that the desires, which are
to be considered by us as the measure of right, must
be such as we approve, and that we ought to pay
no regard to those expectations in others which we
condemn in ourselves, and which, however they
may intrude upon our imagination, we know it our
duty to resist and suppress.
</p>

<p>One of the most celebrated cases which have been
produced as requiring some skill in the direction of
conscience to adapt them to this great rule, is that
of a criminal asking mercy of his judge, who cannot
but know, that if he was in the state of the supplicant,
he should desire that pardon which he now
denies.  The difficulty of this sophism will vanish, if
we remember that the parties are, in reality, on one
side the criminal, and on the other the community,
of which the magistrate is only the minister, and by
which he is intrusted with the publick safety.  The
magistrate, therefore, in pardoning a man unworthy
of pardon, betrays the trust with which he is invested,
gives away what is not his own, and, apparently,
does to others what he would not that
others should do to him.  Even the community,

<pb n="158"/>

whose right is still greater to arbitrary grants of
mercy, is bound by those laws which regard the
great republick of mankind, and cannot justify such
forbearance as may promote wickedness, and lessen
the general confidence and security in which all have
an equal interest, and which all are therefore bound
to maintain.  For this reason the state has not a
right to erect a general sanctuary for fugitives, or give
protection to such as have forfeited their lives by
crimes against the laws of common morality equally
acknowledged by all nations, because no people can,
without infraction of the universal league of social
beings, incite, by prospects of impunity and safety,
those practices in another dominion, which they
would themselves punish in their own.
</p>

<p>One occasion of uncertainty and hesitation, in
those by whom this great rule has been commented
and dilated, is the confusion of what the exacter
casuists are careful to distinguish, <hi rend="italic">debts of
justice</hi>,
and <hi rend="italic">debts of charity</hi>.  The immediate and primary
intention of this precept, is to establish a rule of
justice; and I know not whether invention, or
sophistry, can start a single difficulty to retard its
application, when it is thus expressed and explained,
<hi rend="italic">let every man allow the claim of right in another,
which he shogld think himself entitled to make in the
like circumstances</hi>.
</p>

<p>The discharge of the <hi rend="italic">debts of charity</hi>, or duties
which we owe to others, not merely as required by
justice, but as dictated by benevolence, admits in
its own nature greater complication of circum-
<pb n="159"/>

stances, and greater latitude of choice.  Justice is
indispensably and universally necessary, and what
is necessary must always be limited, uniform, and
distinct.  But beneficence, though in general equally
enjoined by our religion, and equally needful to the
conciliation of the Divine favour, is yet, for the
most part, with regard to its single acts, elective
and voluntary.  We may certainly, without injury
to our fellow-beings, allow in the distribution of
kindness something to our affections, and change
the measure of our liberality, according to our
opinions and prospects, our hopes and fears.  This
rule therefore is not equally determinate and absolute,
with respect to offices of kindness, and acts of
liberality, because liberality and kindness, absolutely
determined, would lose their nature; for how could
we be called tender, or charitable, for giving that
which we are positively forbidden to withhold?
</p>

<p>Yet, even in adjusting the extent of our beneficence,
no other measure can be taken than this
precept affords us, for we can only know what others
suffer for want, by considering how we should be
affected in the same state; nor can we proportion
our assistance by any other rule than that of doing
what we should then expect from others.  It indeed
generally happens that the giver and receiver differ
in their opinions of generosity; the same partiality
to his own interest inclines one to large expectations,
and the other to sparing distributions.  Perhaps
the infirmity of human nature will scarcely
suffer a man groaning under the pressure of distress,

<pb n="160"/>

to judge rightly of the kindness of his friends, or
think they have done enough till his deliverance is
completed; not therefore what we might wish, but
what we could demand from others, we are obliged
to grant, since, though we can easily know how
much we might claim, it is impossible to determine
what we should hope.
</p>

<p>But in all inquiries concerning the practice of
voluntary and occasional virtues, it is safest for
minds not oppressed with superstitious fears to determine
against their own inclinations, and secure
themselves from deficiency, by doing more than
they believe strictly necessary.  For of this every
man may be certain, that, if he were to exchange
conditions with his dependent, he should expect
more than, with the utmost exertion of his ardour,
he now will prevail upon himself to perform; and
when reason has no settled rule, and our passions
are striving to mislead us, it is surely the part of a
wise man to err on the side of safety.

TO THE RAMBLER.<lb/>

<salute>SIR,
</salute>

</opener>

<p>IT will not be necessary to solicit your good-will
by any formal preface, when I have informed you,
that I have long been known as the most laborious
and zealous virtuoso that the present age has had

<pb n="161"/>

the honour of producing, and that inconveniences
have been brought upon me by an unextinguishable
ardour of curiosity, and an unshaken perseverance
in the acquisition of the productions of art and
nature.
</p>

<p>It was observed, from my entrance into the
world, that I had something uncommon in my
disposition, and that there appeared in me very
early tokens of superior genius.  I was always an
enemy to trifles; the playthings which my mother
bestowed upon me I immediately broke, that I
might discover the method of their structure, and
the causes of their motions; of an the toys with
which children are delighted I valued only my
coral, and as soon as I could speak, asked, like
Peiresc, innumerable questions which the maids
about me could not resolve.  As I grew older I was
more thoughtful and serious, and instead of amusing
myself with puerile diversions, made collections of
natural rarities, and never walked into the fields
without bringing home stones of remarkable forms,
or insects of some uncommon species.  I never
entered an old house, from which I did not take
away the painted glass, and often lamented that I
was not one of that happy generation who demolished
the convents and monasteries, and broke
windows by law.
</p>

<p>Being thus early possessed by a taste for solid
knowledge, I passed my youth with very little
disturbance from passions and appetites; and having
no pleasure in the company of boys and girls, who

<pb n="162"/>

talked of plays, politicks, fashions, or love, I carried
on my inquiries with incessant diligence, and had
amassed more stones, mosses, and shells, than are to
be found in many celebrated collections, at an age
in which the greatest part of young men are studying
under tutors, or endeavoring to recommend themselves
to notice by their dress, their air, and their
levities.
</p>

<p>When I was two and twenty years old, I became,
by the death of my father, possessed of a small
estate in land, with a very large sum of money in
the publick funds, and must confess that I did not
much lament him, for he was a man of mean parts,
bent rather upon growing rich than wise.  He once
fretted at the expense of only ten shillings, which
he happened to overhear me offering for the sting
of a hornet, though it was a cold moist summer, in
which very few hornets had been seen.  He often
recommended to me the study of physick, in which,
said he, you may at once gratify your curiosity after
natural history.  and increase your fortune by
benefiting mankind.  I heard him, Mr. Rambler, with
pity, and as there was no prospect of elevating a
mind formed to grovel, sufFered him to please himself
with hoping that I should some time follow his
advice.  For you know that there are men, with
whom, when they have once settled a notion in
their heads, is to very little purpose to dispute.
</p>

<p>Being now left wholly to my own inclinations,
I very soon enlarged the bounds of my curiosity,
and contented myself no longer with such rarities

<pb n="168"/>

as required only judgment and industry, and when
once found might be had for nothing.  I now turned
my thoughts to exoticks and antiques, and became
so well known for my generous patronage of ingenious
men, that my levee was crowded with visitants,
some to see my museum, and others to increase its
treasures, by selling me whatever they had brought
from other countries.
</p>

<p>I had always a contempt for that narrowness of
conception, which contents itself with cultivating
some single corner of the field of science; I took
the whole region into my view, and wished it of
yet greater extent.  But no man's power can be
equal to his will.  I was forced to proceed by slow
degrees, and to purchase what chance or kindness
happened to present.  I did not however proceed
without some design, or imitate the indiscretion of
those, who begin a thousand collections, and finish
none.  Having been always a lover of geography, I
determined to collect the maps drawn in the rude
and barbarous times, before any regular surveys, or
just observations; and have, at a great expense,
brought together a volume, in which, perhaps, not
a single country is laid down according to its true
situation, and by which, he that desires to know the
errours of the ancient geographers may be amply
informed.
</p>

<p>But my ruling passion is patriotism: my chief
care has been to procure the products of our own
country; and as Alfred received the tribute of the
Welsh in wolves' heads, I allowed my tenants to

<pb n="164"/>

pay their rents in butterflies, till I had exhausted
the papilionaceous tribe.  I then directed them to
the pursuit of other animals, and obtained, by this
easy method, most of the grubs and insects, which
land, air, or water, can supply.  I have three species
of earth-worms not known to the naturalists, have
discovered a new ephemera, and can shew four wasps
that were taken torpid in their winter quarters.  I
have, from my own ground, the longest blade of
grass upon record, and once accepted, as a half
year's rent for a field of wheat, an ear containing
more grains than had been seen before upon a
single stem.
</p>

<p>One of my tenants so much neglected his own
interest, as to supply me, in a whole summer, with
only two horse-flies, and those of little more than
the common size; and I was upon the brink of
seizing for arrears, when his good fortune threw a
white mole in his way, for which he was not only
forgiven, but rewarded.
</p>

<p>These, however, were petty acquisitions, and
made at small expense; nor should I have ventured
to rank myself among the virtuosi without better
claims.  I have suffered nothing worthy the regard
of a wise man to escape my notice.  I have ransacked
the old and the new world, and been equally attentive
to past ages and the present.  For the illustration
of ancient history, I can shew a marble, of which
the inscription, though it is not now legible, appears,
from some broken remains of the letters, to have
been Tuscan, and therefore probably engraved

<pb n="165"/>

before the foundation of Rome.  I have two pieces
of prophyry found among the ruins of Ephesus,
and three letters broken off by a learned traveller
from the monuments of Persepolis; a piece of stone
which paved the Areopagus of Athens, and a plate
without figures or characters, which was found at
Corinth, and which I therefore believe to be that
metal which was once valued before gold.  I have
sand gathered out of the Granicus; a fragment of
Trajan's bridge over the Danube; some of the
mortar which cemented the watercourse of Tarquin;
a horseshoe broken on the Flaminian way; and a
turf with five daisies dug from the field of Pharsalia.
</p>

<p>I do not wish to raise the envy of the unsuccessful
collectors, by too pompous a display of my
scientifick wealth, but cannot forbear to observe,
that there are few regions of the globe which are
not honoured with some memorial in my cabinets.
The Persian monarchs are said to have boasted the
greatness of their empire, by being served at their
tables with drink from the Ganges and the Danube.
I can shew one vial, of which the water was formerly
an icicle on the crags of Caucasus, and another
that contains what once was snow on the top of
Atlas; in a third is dew brushed from a banana in
the gardens of Ispahan; and, in another, brine that
has rolled in the Pacifick ocean.  I flatter myself
that I am writing to a man who will rejoice at the
honour which my labours have procured to my
country; and therefore I shall tell you that Britain
can, by my care, boast of a snail that has crawled

<pb n="166"/>

upon the wall of China; a humming bird which an
American princess wore in her ear; the tooth of an
elephant who carried the queen of Siam; the skin
of an ape that was kept in the palace of the great
Mogul; a ribbon that adorned one of the maids of
a Turkish sultana; and a seymitar once wielded by
a soldier of Abas the Great.
</p>

<p>In collecting antiquities of every country, I have
been careful to choose only by intrinsick worth, and
real usefulness, without regard to party or opinions.
I have therefore a lock of Cromwell's hair in a box
turned from a piece of the royal oak; and keep in the
same drawers, sand scraped from the coffin of king
Richard, and a commission signed by Henry the Seventh.
I have equal veneration for the ruff of Elizabeth
and the shoe of Mary of Scotland: and should
lose, with like regret, a tobacco-pipe of Raleigh, and
a stirrup of king James.  I have paid the same price
for a glove of Lewis, and a thimble of queen Mary;
for a fur cap of the Czar, and a boot of Charles
of Sweden.
</p>

<p>You will easily imagine that these accumulations
were not made without some diminution of my
fortune, for I was so well known to spare no cost,
that at every sale some bid against me for hire,
some for sport, and some for malice; and if I asked
the price of any thing, it was sufficient to double
the demand.  For curiosity, trafficking thus with
avarice, the wealth of India had not been enough;
and I, by little and little, transferred all my money
from the funds to my closet: here I was inclined to

<pb n="167"/>

stop, and live upon my estate in literary leisure,
but the sale of the Harleian collection shook my
resolution: I mortgaged my land, and purchased
thirty medals, which I could never find before.  I
have at length bought till I can buy no longer, and
the cruelty of my creditors has seized my repository;
I am therefore condemned to disperse what the
labour of an age will not re-assemble.  I submit to
that which cannot be opposed, and shall, in a short
time declare a sale.  I have, while it is yet in my
power, sent you a pebble, picked up by Tavernier
on the banks of the Ganges; for which I desire no
other recompense than that you will recommend
my catalogue to the publick.

</p>

<p> All useless science is an empty boast.
</p>

</epigraph>

<p>THE publication of the letter in my last paper
has naturally led me to the consideration of
thirst after curiosities, which often draws contempt
and ridicule upon itself, but which is perhaps
no otherwise blameable, than as it wants those
circumstantial recommendations which add lustre
even to moral excellencies, and are absolutely
necessary to the grace and beauty of indifferent
actions.
</p>

<p>Learning confers so much superiority on those
who possess it, that they might probably have escaped

<pb n="168"/>

all censure had they been able to agree among themselves;
but as envy and competition have divided the
republick of letters into factions, they have neglected
the common interest; each has called in foreign
aid, and endeavoured to strengthen his own cause
by the frown of power, the hiss of ignorance, and
the clamour of popularity.  They have all engaged
in feuds, till by mutual hostilities they demolished
those out-works which veneration had raised for
their security, and exposed themselves to barbarians,
by whom every region of science is equally laid
waste.
</p>

<p>Between men of different studies and professions,
may be observed a constant reciprocation of reproaches.
The collector of shells and stones derides
the folly of him who pastes leaves and flowers upon
paper, pleases himself with colours that are perceptibly
fading, and amasses with care what cannot
be preserved.  The hunter of insects stands amazed
that any man can waste his short time upon lifeless
matter, while many tribes of animals yet want their
history.  Every one is inclined not only to promote
his own study, but to exclude all others from regard,
and having heated his imagination with some
favourite pursuit, wonders that the rest of mankind
are not seized with the same passion.
</p>

<p>There are, indeed, many subjects of study which
seem but remotely allied to useful knowledge, and
of little importance to happiness or virtue; nor is it
easy to forbear some sallies of merriment, or expressions
of pity, when we see a man wrinkled with

<pb n="169"/>

attention, and emaciated with solicitude, in the
investigation of questions, of which, without visible
inconvenience, the world may expire in ignorance.
Yet it is dangerous to discourage well-intended
labours, or innocent curiosity; for he who is employed
in searches, which by any deduction of consequences
tend to the benefit of life, is surely
laudable, in comparison of those who spend their
time in counteracting happiness, and filling the
world with wrong and danger, confusion and remorse.
No man can perform so little as not to have
reason to congratulate himself on his merits, when
he beholds the multitudes that live in total idleness,
and have never yet endeavoured to be useful.
</p>

<p>It is impossible to determine the limits of inquiry,
or to foresee what consequences a new discovery
may produce.  He who suffers not his faculties to lie
torpid, has a chance, whatever be his employment,
of doing good to his fellow creatures.  The man that
first ranged the woods in search of medicinal springs,
or climbed the mountains for salutary plants, has
undoubtedly merited the gratitude of posterity,
how much soever his frequent miscarriages might
excite the scorn of his contemporaries.  If what
appears little be universally despised, nothing
greater can be attained, for all that is great was at
first little, and rose to its present bulk by gradual
accessions, and accumulated labours.
</p>

<p>Those who lay out time or money in assembling
matter for contemplation, are doubtless entitled to
some degree of respect, though in a flight of gaiety

<pb n="170"/>

it be easy to ridicule their treasure, or in a fit of
sullenness to despise it.  A man who thinks only on
the particular object before him, goes not away
much illuminated by having enjoyed the privilege
of handling the tooth of a shark, or the paw of a
white bear; yet there is nothing more worthy of
admiration to a philosophical eye than the structure
of animals, by which they are qualified to support
life in the elements or climates to which they are
appropriated; and of all natural bodies it must be
generally confessed, that they exhibit evidences of
infinite wisdom, bear their testimony to the supreme
reason, and excite in the mind new raptures of
gratitude, and new incentives to piety.
</p>

<p>To collect the productions of art, and examples
of mechanical science or manual ability, is unquestionably
useful, even when the things themselves
are of small importance, because it is always
advantageous to know how far the human powers have
proceeded, and how much experience has found to
be within the reach of diligence.  Idleness and
timidity often despair without being overcome, and
forbear attempts for fear of being defeated; and we
may promote the invigoration of faint endeavours,
by shewing what has been already performed.  It
may sometimes happen that the greatest efforts of
ingenuity have been exerted in trifles; yet the same
principles and expedients may be applied to more
valuable purposes, and the movements, which put
into action machines of no use but to raise the
wonder of ignorance, may be employed to drain

<pb n="171"/>

fens, or manufacture metals, to assist the architect,
or preserve the sailor.
</p>

<p>For the utensils, arms, or dresses of foreign
nations, which make the greatest part of many
collections, I have little regard when they are
valued only because they are foreign, and can suggest
no improvement of our own practice.  Yet they
are not all equally useless, nor can it be always
safely determined which should be rejected or retained;
for they may sometimes unexpectedly contribute
to the illustration of history, and to the
knowledge of the natural commodities of the country,
or of the genius and customs of its inhabitants.
</p>

<p>Rarities there are of yet a lower rank, which owe
their worth merely to accident, and which can convey
no information, nor satisfy any rational desire.
Such are many fragments of antiquity, as urns and
pieces of pavement; and things held in veneration
only for having been once the property of some
eminent person, as the armour of King Henry; or
for having been used on some remarkable occasion,
as the lantern of Guy Faux.  The loss or preservation
of these seems to be a thing indifferent, nor can I
perceive why the possession of them should be
coveted.  Yet, perhaps, even this curiosity is implanted
by nature; and when I find Tully confessing
of himself, that he could not forbear at Athens to
visit the walks and houses which the old philosophers
had frequented or inhabited, and recollect
the reverence which every nation, civil and barbarous,
has paid to the ground where merit has been

<pb n="172"/>

buried<ref target="JohRamb.7">[x]</ref>, I am afraid to declare against the general
voice of mankind, and am inclined to believe, that
this regard, which we involuntarily pay to the
meanest relique of a man great and illustrious, is
intended as an incitement to labour, and an
encouragement to expect the same renown, if it be
sought by the same virtues.
</p>

<note id="JohRamb.7"><seg type="note-symbol">[x]</seg> <p>See this sentiment illustrated by a most splendid passage in Dr.
Johnson's "Journey to the Western Islands," when he was on the Island
of Iona.</p></note>

<p>The virtuoso therefore cannot be said to be wholly
useless; but perhaps he may be sometimes culpable
for confining himself to business below his genius,
and losing, in petty speculations, those hours by
which, if he had spent them in nobler studies, he
might have given new light to the intellectual
world.  It is never without grief, that I find a man
capable of ratiocination or invention enlisting himself
in this secondary class of learning; for when he
has once discovered a method of gratifying his
desire of eminence by expense rather than by labour,
and known the sweets of a life blest at once with the
ease of idleness, and the reputation of knowledge,
he will not easily be brought to undergo again the
toil of thinking, or leave his toys and trinkets for
arguments and principles, arguments which require
circumspection and vigilance, and principles which
cannot be obtained but by the drudgery of meditation.
He will gladly shut himself up for ever with
his shells and medals, like the companions of
Ulysses, who, having tasted the fruit of Lotos,

<pb n="173"/>

would not, even by the hope of seeing their own
country, be tempted again to the dangers of
the sea. </p>

<opener>TO THE RAMBLER.<lb/>

<salute>SIR,
</salute>

</opener>

<p>You seem in all your papers to be an enemy to
tyranny, and to look with impartiality upon
the world; I shall therefore lay my case before you,
and hope by your decision to be set free from
unreasonable restraints, and enabled to justify myself
against the accusations which spite and peevishness
produce against me.
</p>

<p>At the age of five years I lost my mother; and
my father, being not qualified to superintend the
education of a girl, committed me to the care of
his sister, who instructed me with the authority,
and, not to deny her what she may justly claim,
with the affection of a parent.  She had not very
elevated sentiments, or extensive views, but her
principles were good, and her intentions pure; and,

<pb n="175"/>

though some may practise more virtues, scarce any
commit fewer faults.
</p>

<p>Under this good lady I learned all the common
rules of decent behaviour, and standing maxims of
domestick prudence; and might have grown up by
degrees to a country gentlewoman, without any
thoughts of ranging beyond the neighborhood, had
not Flavia come down, last summer, to visit her
relations in the next village.  I was taken, of course,
to compliment the stranger, and was, at the first
sight, surprised at the unconcern with which she
saw herself gazed at by the company whom she
had never known before; at the carelessness with
which she received compliments, and the readiness
with which she returned them.  I found she had
something which I perceived myself to want, and
could not but wish to be like her, at once easy
and officious, attentive and unembarrassed.  I went
home, and for four days could think and talk of
nothing but Miss Flavia; though my aunt told me,
that she was a forward slut, and thought herself
wise before her time.
</p>

<p>In a little time she repaid my visit, and raised in
my heart a new confusion of love and admiration.
I soon saw her again, and still found new charms in
her air, conversation, and behaviour.  You, who have
perhaps seen the world, may have observed, that
formality soon ceases between young persons.  I
know not how others are affected on such occasions,
but I found myself irresistibly allured to
friendship and intimacy, by the familiar complai-
<pb n="176"/>

sance and airy gaiety of Flavia; so that in a few
weeks I became her favourite, and all the time was
passed with me, that she could gain from ceremony
and visit.
</p>

<p>As she came often to me, she necessarily spent
some hours with my aunt, to whom she paid great
respect by low courtesies, submissive compliance,
and soft acquiescence; but as I became gradually
more accustomed to her manners, I discovered that
her civility was general; that there was a certain
degree of deference shewn by her to circumstances
and appearances; that many went away flattered
by her humility, whom she despised in her heart;
that the influence of far the greatest part of those
with whom she conversed ceased with their presence;
and that sometimes she did not remember the names
of them, whom, without any intentional insincerity
or false commendation, her habitual civility had
sent away with very high thoughts of their own
importance.
</p>

<p>It was not long before I perceived that my aunt's
opinion was not of much weight in Flavia's deliberations,
and that she was looked upon by her as a
woman of narrow sentiments, without knowledge
of books, or observations on mankind.  I had hitherto
considered my aunt as entitled, by her wisdom and
experience, to the highest reverence; and could not
forbear to wonder that any one so much younger
should venture to suspect her of errour, or ignorance;
but my surprise was without uneasiness, and being
now accustomed to think Flavia always in the right,

<pb n="177"/>

I readily learned from her to trust my own reason,
and to believe it possible, that they who had lived
longer might be mistaken.
</p>

<p>Flavia had read much, and used so often to converse
on subjects of learning, that she put all the
men in the country to flight, except the old parson,
who declared himself much delighted with her
company, because she gave him opportunities to
recollect the studies of his younger years, and, by
some mention of ancient story, had made him rub
the dust off his Homer, which had lain unregarded
in his closet.  With Homer, and a thousand other
names familiar to Flavia, I had no acquaintance,
but began, by comparing her accomplishments with
my own, to repine at my education, and wish that
I had not been so long confined to the company of
those from whom nothing but housewifery was to be
learned.  I then set myself to peruse such books as
Flavia recommended, and heard her opinion of their
beauties and defects.  I saw new worlds hourly bursting
upon my mind, and was enraptured at the prospect
of diversifying life with endless entertainment.
</p>

<p>The old lady, finding that a large screen, which I
had undertaken to adorn with turkey-work against
winter, made very slow advances, and that I had
added in two months but three leaves to a flowered
apron then in the frame, took the alarm, and with
all the zeal of honest folly exclaimed against my
new acquaintance, who had filled me with idle
notions, and turned my head with books.  But she
had now lost her authority, for I began to find

<pb n="178"/>

innumerable mistakes in her opinions, and improprieties
in her language; and therefore thought
myself no longer bound to pay much regard to one
who knew little beyond her needle and her dairy,
and who professed to think that nothing more is
required of a women than to see that the house is
clean, and that the maids go to bed and rise at a
certain hour.
</p>

<p>She seemed however to look upon Flavia as seducing
me, and to imagine that when her influence
was withdrawn, I should return to my allegiance;
she therefore contented herself with remote hints,
and gentle admonitions, intermixed with sage histories
of the miscarriages of wit, and disappointments
of pride.  But since she has found, that though
Flavia is departed, I still persist in my new scheme,
she has at length lost her patience, she snatches my
book out of my hand, tears my paper if she finds
me writing, burns Flavia's letters before my face
when she can seize them, and threatens to lock me
up, and to complain to my father of my perverseness.
If women, she says, would but know their duty
and their interest, they would be careful to acquaint
themselves with family affairs, and many a penny
might be saved; for while the mistress of the house is
scribbling and reading, servants are junketing, and
linen is wearing out.  She then takes me round the
rooms, shews me the worked hangings, and chairs
of tent-stitch, and asks whether all this was done
with a pen and a book.
</p>

<p>I cannot deny that I sometimes laugh and some-
<pb n="179"/>

times am sullen; but she has not delicacy enough
to be much moved either with my mirth or my
gloom, if she did not think the interest of the
family endangered by this change of my manners.
She had for some years marked out young Mr.
Surly, an heir in the neighbourhood, remarkable
for his love of fighting-cocks, as an advantageous
match; and was extremely pleased with the civilities
which he used to pay me, till under Flavia's tuition
I learned to talk of subjects which he could not
understand.  This, she says, is the consequence of
female study: girls grow too wise to be advised,
and too stubborn to be commanded; but she is resolved
to try who shall govern, and will thwart my
humour till she breaks my spirit.
</p>

<p>These menaces, Mr. Rambler, sometimes make
me quite angry; for I have been sixteen these ten
weeks, and think myself exempted from the dominion
of a governess, who has no pretensions to more
sense or knowledge than myself.  I am resolved,
since I am as tall and as wise as other women, to
be no longer treated like a girl.  Miss Flavia has
often told me, that ladies of my age go to assemblies
and routs, without their mothers and their
aunts; I shall therefore, from this time, leave asking
advice, and refuse to give accounts.  I wish you
would state the time at which young ladies may
judge for themselves, which I am sure you cannot
but think ought to begin before sixteen; if you are
inclined to delay it longer, I shall have very little
regard to your opinion.

<pb n="180"/>

</p>

<p>My aunt often tells me of the advantages of experience,
and of the deference due to seniority; and
both she and all the antiquated part of the world,
talk of the unreserved obedience which they paid
to the commands of their parents, and the undoubting
confidence with which they listened to their
precepts; of the terrors which they felt at a frown,
and the humility with which they supplicated forgiveness
whenever they had offended.  I cannot but
fancy that this boast is too general to be true, and
that the young and the old were always at variance.
I have, however, told my aunt, that I will mend
whatever she will prove to be wrong; but she
replies that she has reasons of her own, and that she
is sorry to live in an age when girls have the
impudence to ask for proofs.
</p>

<p>I beg once again, Mr. Rambler, to know whether
I am not as wise as my aunt, and whether, when
she presumes to check me as a baby, I may not
pluck up a spirit and return her insolence.  I shall
not proceed to extremities without your advice,
which is therefore impatiently expected by
</p>

<l>Otia si tollas periere Cupidinis arcus</l>
<l>Contemptaeque jacent, et sie luce faces.

<lg type="poem">

<l>At busy hearts in vain Love's arrows fly;</l>
<l>Dim'd, scorn'd, and impotent, his torches lie.
</l>

</lg>

</epigraph>

<p>MANY writers of eminence in physick have
laid out their diligence upon the consideration
of those distempers to which men are exposed by
particular states of life, and very learned treatises
have been produced upon the maladies of the camp,
the sea, and the mines.  There are, indeed, few
employments which a man accustomed to anatomical
inquiries, and medical refinements, would not find
reasons for declining as dangerous to health, did not
his learning or experience inform him, that almost
every occupation, however inconvenient or formidable,
is happier and safer than a life of sloth.
</p>

<p>The necessity of action is not only demonstrable
from the fabrick of the body, but evident from observation
of the universal practice of mankind, who,
for the preservation of health, in those whose rank
or wealth exempts them from the necessity of
lucrative labour, have invented sports and diversions,
though not of equal use to the world with
manual trades, yet of equal fatigue to those who
practise them, and differing only from the drudgery
of the husbandman or manufacturer, as they are
acts of choice, and therefore performed without the
painful sense of compulsion.  The huntsman rises
early, pursues his game through all the dangers and

<pb n="182"/>

obstructions of the chace, swims rivers, and scales
precipices, till he returns home no less harassed than
the soldier, and has perhaps sometimes incurred as
great hazard of wounds or death; yet he has no
motive to incite his ardour; he is neither subject to
the commands of a general, nor dreads any penalties
for neglect and disobedience; he has neither
profit nor honour to expect from his perils and his
conquests, but toils without the hope of mural or
civick garlands, and must content himself with the
praise of his tenants and companions.
</p>

<p>But such is the constitution of man, that labour
may be styled its own reward; nor will any external
incitements be requisite, if it be considered how
much happiness is gained, and how much misery
escaped, by frequent and violent agitation of the
body.
</p>

<p>Ease is the most that can be hoped from a sedentary
and unactive habit; ease, a neutral state between
pain and pleasure.  The dance of spirits, the
bound of vigour, readiness of enterprize, and defiance
of fatigue, are reserved for him that braces his
nerves, and hardens his fibres, that keeps his limbs
pliant with motion, and by frequent exposure fortifies
his frame against the common accidents of
cold and heat.
</p>

<p>With ease, however, if it could be secured, many
would be content; but nothing terrestrial can be
kept at a stand.  Ease, if it is not rising into pleasure,
will be falling towards pain; and whatever hope
the dreams of speculation may suggest of observing

<pb n="183"/>

the proportion between nutriment and labour, and
keeping the body in a healthy state by supplies
exactly equal to its waste, we know that, in effect,
the vital powers unexcited by motion, grow gradually
languid; that, as their vigour fails, obstructions
are generated; and that from obstructions proceed
most of those pains which wear us away slowly with
periodical tortures, and which, though they sometimes
suffer life to be long, condemn it to be useless,
chain us down to the couch of misery, and mock us
with the hopes of death.
</p>

<p>Exercise cannot secure us from that dissolution
to which we are decreed; but while the soul and
body continue united, it can make the association
pleasing, and give probable hopes that they shall be
disjoined by an easy separation.  It was a principle
among the ancients, that acute diseases are from
heaven, and chronical from ourselves: the dart of
death indeed falls from heaven, but we poison it by
our own misconduct: to die is the fate of man, but
to die with lingering anguish is generally his folly<ref
target="JohRamb.8">[y]</ref>.
</p>

<note id="JohRamb.8"><seg type="note-symbol">[y]</seg> <p>This passage was once strangely supposed by
some readers to recommend suicide, instead of <hi
rend="italic">exercise</hi>, which is surely the more obvious
meaning.  See, however, a letter from Dr. Johnson on the subject, in
Boswell's Life.  vol. iv. p. 162.</p></note>

<p>It is necessary to that perfection of which our
present state is capable, that the mind and body
should both be kept in action; that neither the faculties
of the one nor of the other be suffered to grow
lax or torpid for want of use; that neither health be
purchased by voluntary submission to ignorance,

<pb n="184"/>

nor knowledge cultivated at the expense of that
health, which must enable it either to give pleasure
to its possessor, or assistance to others.  It is too
frequently the pride of students to despise those
amusements and recreations, which give to the rest
of mankind strength of limbs and cheerfulness of
heart.  Solitude and contemplation are indeed seldom
consistent with such skill in common exercises or
sports as is necessary to make them practised with
delight, and no man is willing to do that of which
the necessity is not pressing and immediate, when
he knows that his awkwardness must make him
ridiculous.

<p>Thus the man of learning is often resigned, almost
by his own consent, to languor and pain; and while
in the prosecution of his studies he suffers the weariness
of labour, is subject by his course of life to the
maladies of idleness.
</p>

<p>It was, perhaps, from the observation of this
mischievous omission in those who are employed about
intellectual objects, that Locke has, in his "System
of Education," urged the necessity of a trade to
men of all ranks and professions, that when the
mind is weary with its proper task, it may be re-
<pb n="185"/>

laxed by a slighter attention to some mechanical
operation; and that while the vital functions are
resuscitated and awakened by vigourous motion, the
understanding may be restrained from that vagrance
and dissipation by which it relieves itself after a
long intenseness of thought, unless some allurement
be presented that may engage application without
anxiety.
</p>

<p>There is so little reason for expecting frequent
conformity to Locke's precept, that it is not necessary
to inquire whether the practice of mechanical
arts might not give occasion to petty emulation, and
degenerate ambition; and whether, if our divines
and physicians were taught the lathe and the chisel,
they would not think more of their tools than their
books; as Nero neglected the care of his empire for
his chariot and his fiddle.  It is certainly dangerous
to be too much pleased with little things; but what
is there which may not be perverted? Let us
remember how much worse employment might have
been found for those hours, which a manual occupation
appears to engross; let us compute the profit
with the loss, and when we reflect how often a
genius is allured from his studies, consider likewise
that perhaps by the same attraction he is sometimes
withheld from debauchery, or recalled from malice,
from ambition, from envy, and from lust.
</p>

<p>I have always admired the wisdom of those by
whom our female education was instituted, for having
contrived, that every woman, of whatever condition,
should be taught some arts of manufacture,

<pb n="186"/>

by which the vacuities of recluse and domestick
leisure may be filled up.  These arts are more necessary,
as the weakness of their sex and the general
system of life debar ladies from any employments
which, by diversifying the circumstances of men,
preserve them from being cankered by the rust of
their own thoughts.  I know not how much of the
virtue and happiness of the world may be the consequence
of this judicious regulation.  Perhaps, the
most powerful fancy might be unable to figure the
confusion and slaughter that would be produced by
so many piercing eyes and vivid understandings,
turned loose at once upon mankind, with no other
business than to sparkle and intrigue, to perplex and
to destroy.
</p>

<p>For my part, whenever chance brings within my
observation a knot of misses busy at their needles,
I consider myself as in the school of virtue; and
though I have no extraordinary skill in plain work
or embroidery, look upon their operations with as
much satisfaction as their governess, because I
regard them as providing a security against the
most dangerous ensnarers of the soul, by enabling
themselves to exclude idleness from their solitary
moments, and with idleness her attendant train of
passions, fancies, and chimeras, fears, sorrows, and
desires.  Ovid and Cervantes will inform them that
love has no power but over those whom he catches
unemployed; and Hector, in the Iliad, when he
sees Andromache overwhelmed with terrours, sends
her for consolation to the loom and the distaff.

<pb n="187"/>

</p>

<p>It is certain that any wild wish or vain imagination
never takes such firm possession of the mind,
as when it is found empty and unoccupied.  The old
peripatetick principle, that <hi rend="italic">Nature abhors a
vacuum</hi>,
may be properly applied to the intellect, which will
embrace any thing, however absurd or criminal,
rather than be wholly without an object.  Perhaps
every man may date the predominance of those
desires that disturb his life and contaminate his
conscience, from some unhappy hour when too
much leisure exposed him to their incursions; for
he has lived with little observation either on himself
or others, who does not know that to be idle is
to be vicious.

<p>ONE of the ancients has observed, that the burthen
of government is increased upon princes
by the virtues of their immediate predecessors.  It
is, indeed, always dangerous to be placed in a state
of unavoidable comparison with excellence, and the
danger is still greater when that excellence is
consecrated by death; when envy and interest cease to
act against it, and those passions by which it was at
first vilified and opposed, now stand in its defence,
and turn their vehemence against honest emulation.
</p>

<p>He that succeeds a celebrated writer, has the
same difficulties to encounter; he stands under the

<pb n="188"/>

shade of exalted merit, and is hindered from rising
to his natural height, by the interception of those
beams which should invigorate and quicken him.
He applies to that attention which is already engaged,
and unwilling to be drawn off from certain
satisfaction; or perhaps to an attention already
wearied, and not to be recalled to the same object.
</p>

<p>One of the old poets congratulates himself that he
had the untrodden regions of Parnassus before him,
and that his garland will be gathered from plantations
which no writer had yet culled.  But the imitator
treads a beaten walk, and with all his diligence
can only hope to find a few flowers or branches
untouched by his predecessor, the refuse of contempt,
or the omissions of negligence.  The Macedonian
conqueror, when he was once invited to hear a
man that sung like a nightingale, replied with contempt,
"that he had heard the nightingale herself;"
and the same treatment must every man
expect, whose praise is that he imitates another.
</p>

<p>Yet, in the midst of these discouraging reflections,
I am about to offer to my reader some
observations upon "Paradise Lost," and hope,
that, however I may fall below the illustrious
writer who has so long dictated to the commonwealth
of learning, my attempt may not be wholly
useless.  There are, in every age, new errours to be
rectified, and new prejudices to be opposed.  False
taste is always busy to mislead those that are
entering upon the regions of learning; and the
traveller, uncertain of his way, and forsaken by the

<pb n="189"/>

sun, will be pleased to see a fainter orb arise on the
horizon, that may rescue him from total darkness,
though with weak and borrowed lustre.
</p>

<p>Addison, though he has considered this poem
under most of the general topicks of criticism has
barely touched upon the versification; not probably
because he thought the art of numbers unworthy
of his notice, for he knew with what minute attention
the ancient criticks considered the disposition
of syllables, and had himself given hopes of some
metrical observations upon the great Roman poet;
but being the first who undertook to display the
beauties, and point out the defects of Milton, he
had many objects at once before him, and passed
willingly over those which were most barren of
ideas, and required labour, rather than genius.
</p>

<p>Yet versification, or the art of modulating his
numbers, is indispensably necessary to a poet.
Every other power by which the understanding is
enlightened, or the imagination enchanted, may be
exercised in prose.  But the poet has this peculiar
superiority, that to all the powers which the perfection
of every other composition can require, he
adds the faculty of joining music with reason, and
of acting at once upon the senses and the passions.
I suppose there are few who do not feel themselves
touched by poetical melody, and who will not
confess that they are more or less moved by the
same thoughts, as they are conveyed by different
sounds, and more affected by the same words in one
order than in another.  The perception of harmony

<pb n="190"/>

is indeed conferred upon men in degrees very unequal,
but there are none who do not perceive it,
or to whom a regular series of proportionate sounds
cannot give delight.
</p>

<p>In treating on the versification of Milton, I am
desirous to be generally understood, and shall
therefore studiously decline the dialect of grammarians;
though, indeed, it is always difficult, and
sometimes scarcely possible, to deliver the precepts
of an art, without the terms by which the peculiar
ideas of that art are expressed, and which had not
been invented but because the language already in
use was insufficient.  If, therefore, I shall sometimes
seem obscure, it may be imputed to this voluntary
interdiction, and to a desire of avoiding that offence
which is always given by unusual words.
</p>

<p>The heroick measure of the English language
may be properly considered as pure or mixed.  It is
pure when the accent rests upon every second syllable
through the whole line.
 </p>


<q><lg type="poem"><l>Courage uncertain

l&oacute;veless, j&oacute;yless,
&uacute;nend&eacute;ar'd.</l><byline>MILTON.</byline></lg></q>

<p>The accent may be observed, in the second line of
Dryden, and the second and fourth of Milton, to
repose upon every second syllable.
</p>

<p>The repetition of this sound or percussion at
equal times, is the most complete harmony of which

<pb n="191"/>

a single verse is capable, and should therefore be
exactly kept in distichs, and generally in the last
line of a paragraph, that the ear may rest without
any sense of imperfection.
</p>

<p>But, to preserve the series of sounds untransposed
in a long composition, is not only very difficult, but
tiresome and disgusting; for we are soon wearied
with the perpetual recurrence of the same cadence.
Necessity has therefore enforced the mixed measure,
in which some variation of the accents is allowed;
this, though it always injures the harmony of the
line, considered by itself, yet compensates the loss
by relieving us from the continual tyranny of the
same sound, and makes us more sensible of the harmony
of the pure measure.
</p>

<p>Of these mixed numbers every poet affords us
innumerable instances, and Milton seldom has two
pure lines together, as will appear if any of his paragraphs
be read with attention merely to the musick.
</p>

<q><lg type="poem">

<l> Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake,</l>
<l> And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep.
</l></lg></q>


<pb n="192"/>


<p>In this passage it will be at first observed, that
all the lines are not equally harmonious, and upon
a nearer examination it will be found that only the
fifth and ninth lines are regular, and the rest are
more or less licentious with respect to the accent.
In some the accent is equally upon two syllables
together, and in both strong.  As
</p>

<q><lg type="poem">
<l>Thus at their shady lodge arriv'd, <hi rend="italic">both
stood</hi>,</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Both turn'd</hi>, and under open sky ador'd</l>
<l>The God that made both sky, <hi rend="italic">air, earth</hi>, and heav'n.
</l></lg></q>

<p>In others the accent is equally upon two syllables,
but upon both weak.

<q><lg type="poem">
<l>&mdash;A race</l>
<l>To fill the earth, who shall with us extol</l>
<l>Thy goodness <hi rend="italic">infinite</hi>, both when we wake</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">And when</hi> we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep.
</l></lg></q>

In the first pair of syllables the accent may deviate
from the rigour of exactness, without any unpleasing
diminution of harmony, as may be observed in
the lines already cited, and more remarkably in this,



<q><lg type="poem">
<l>&mdash;Thou also mad'st the night</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Maker</hi> omnipotent! and thou the day.
</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>But, excepting in the first pair of syllables, which
may be considered as arbitrary, a poet who, not
having the invention or knowledge of Milton, has
more need to allure his audience by musical cadences,
should seldom suder more than one aberration
from the rule in any single verse.
</p>

<p>There are two lines in this passage more remarkably
unharmonious:

<q><lg type="poem">
<l>&mdash;This delicious place,</l>
<l>For us too large; <hi rend="italic">where thy</hi> abundance wants</l>
<l>Partakers, and uncrop'd <hi rend="italic">falls</hi> to the ground.
</l></lg></q>


<pb n="193"/>


Here the third pair of syllables in the first, and
fourth pair in the second verse, have their accents
retrograde or inverted; the first syllable being strong
or acute, and the second weak.  The detriment which
the measure suffers by this inversion of the accents
is sometimes less perceptible, when the verses are
carried one into another, but is remarkably striking
in this place, where the vicious verse concludes a
period, and is yet more offensive in rhyme, when
we regularly attend to the flow of every single line.
This will appear by reading a couplet in which
Cowley, an author not sufficiently studious of
harmony, has committed the same fault.

<q><lg type="poem">
<l>&mdash;His harmless life</l>
<l>Does with substantial blessedness abound,</l>
<l>And the soft wings of peace <hi rend="italic">cover</hi> him round.
</l></lg></q>

In these the law of metre is very grossly violated
by mingling combinations of sound directly opposite
to each other, as Milton expresses in his sonnet,
by <hi rend="italic">Committing short and long</hi>, and setting one part
of the measure at variance with the rest.  The
ancients, who had a language more capable of variety
than ours, had two kinds of verse, the Iambick, consisting
of short and long syllables alternately, from
which our heroick measure is derived, and Trochaick,
consisting in a like alternation of long and short.
These were considered as opposites, and conveyed
the contrary images of speed and slowness; to confound
them, therefore, as in these lines, is to deviate
from the established practice.  But where the senses

<pb n="194"/>

are to judge, authority is not necessary, the ear is
sufficient to detect dissonance, nor should I have
sought auxiliaries on such an occasion against any
name but that of Milton.

<p>THAT few things are so liberally bestowed, or
squandered with so little effect, as good advice,
has been generally observed; and many sage positions
have been advanced concerning the reasons of
this complaint, and the means of removing it.  It is
indeed an important and noble inquiry, for little
would be wanting to the happiness of life, if every
man could conform to the right as soon as he was
shewn it.
</p>

<p>This perverse neglect of the most salutary precepts,
and stubborn resistance of the most pathetick
persuasion, is usually imputed to him by whom the
counsel is received, and we often hear it mentioned
as a sign of hopeless depravity, that though good
advice was given, it has wrought no reformation.
</p>

<p>Others, who imagine themselves to have quicker
sagacity and deeper penetration, have found out

<pb n="195"/>

that the inefficacy of advice is usually the fault of
the counsellor, and rules have been laid down, by
which this important duty may be successfully performed.
We are directed by what tokens to discover
the favourable moment at which the heart is disposed
for the operation of truth and reason, with
what address to administer, and with what vehicles
to disguise <hi rend="italic">the catharticks of the soul</hi>.
</p>

<p>But, notwithstanding this specious expedient,
we find the world yet in the same state: advice is
still given, but still received with disgust; nor has
it appeared that the bitterness of the medicine has
been yet abated, or its powers increased, by any
methods of preparing it.
</p>

<p>If we consider the manner in which those who
assume the office of directing the conduct of others
execute their undertaking, it will not be wonderful
that their labours, however zealous or affectionate,
are frequently useless.  For what is the advice
that is commonly given? A few general maxims,
enforced with vehemence, and inculcated with
importunity, but failing for want of particular
reference and immediate application.
</p>

<p>It is not often that any man can have so much
knowledge of another, as is necessary to make
instruction useful.  We are sometimes not ourselves
conscious of the original motives of our actions,
and when we know them, our first care is to hide
them from the sight of others, and often from those
most diligently, whose superiority either of power
or understanding may entitle them to inspect our

<pb n="196"/>

lives; it is therefore very probable that he who
endeavours the cure of our intellectual maladies,
mistakes their cause, and that his prescriptions
avail nothing, because he knows not which of the
passions or desires is vitiated.
</p>

<p>Advice, as it always gives a temporary appearance
of superiority, can never be very grateful,
even when it is most necessary or most judicious.
But for the same reason every one is eager to instruct
his neighbours.  To be wise or to be virtuous,
is to buy dignity and importance at a high price;
but when nothing is necessary to elevation but detection
of the follies or the faults of others, no man
is so insensible to the voice of fame as to linger on
the ground.

<p>Vanity is so frequently the apparent motive of
advice, that we, for the most part, summon our
powers to oppose it without any very accurate
inquiry whether it is right.  It is sufficient that
another is growing great in his own eyes at our
expense, and assumes authority over us without
our permission; for many would contentedly suffer
the consequences of their own mistakes, rather
than the insolence of him who triumphs as their
deliverer.
</p>

<p>It is, indeed, seldom found that any advantages

<pb n="197"/>

are enjoyed with that moderation which the uncertainty
of all human good so powerfully enforces;
and therefore the adviser may justly suspect, that
he has inflamed the opposition which he laments
by arrogance and superciliousness.  He may suspect,
but needs not hastily to condemn himself, for he
can rarely be certain that the softest language or
most humble diffidence would have escaped resentment;
since scarcely any degree of circumspection
can prevent or obviate the rage with which the
slothful, the impotent, and the unsuccessful, vent
their discontent upon those that excel them.
Modesty itself, if it is praised, will be envied, and
there are minds so impatient of inferiority, that
their gratitude is a species of revenge, and they return
benefits, not because recompense is a pleasure,
but because obligation is a pain.
</p>

<p>The number of those whom the love of themselves
has thus far corrupted, is perhaps not great;
but there are few so free from vanity, as not to
dictate to those who will hear their instructions
with a visible sense of their own beneficence; and
few to whom it is not unpleasing to receive documents,
however tenderly and cautiously delivered,
or who are not willing to raise themselves from
pupillage, by disputing the propositions of their
teacher.
</p>

<p>It was the maxim, I think, of Alphonsus of
Arragon, that <hi rend="italic">dead counsellors are safest</hi>.  The grave
puts an end to flattery and artifice, and the information
that we receive from books is pure from

<pb n="198"/>

interest, fear, or ambition.  Dead counsellors are
likewise most instructive; because they are heard
with patience and with reverence.  We are not unwilling
to believe that man wiser than ourselves,
from whose abilities we may receive advantage,
without any danger of rivalry or opposition, and
who affords us the light of his experience, without
hurting our eyes by flashes of insolence.
</p>

<p>By the consultation of books, whether of dead
or living authors, many temptations to petulance
and opposition, which occur in oral conferences,
are avoided.  An author cannot obtrude his service
unasked, nor can be often suspected of any
malignant intention to insult his readers with his
knowledge or his wit.  Yet so prevalent is the
habit of comparing ourselves with others, while
they remain within the reach of our passions,
that books are seldom read with complete
impartiality, but by those from whom the writer is
placed at such a distance that his life or death
is indifferent.
</p>

<p>We see that volumes may be perused, and perused
with attention, to little effect; and that maxims
of prudence, or principles of virtue, may be treasured
in the memory without influencing the conduct.
Of the numbers that pass their lives among
books, very few read to be made wiser or better,
apply any general reproof of vice to themselves, or
try their own manners by axioms of justice.  They
purpose either to consume those hours for which
they can find no other amusement, to gain or pre-
<pb n="199"/>

serve that respect which learning has always obtained;
or to gratify their curiosity with knowledge,
which, like treasures buried and forgotten, is of no
use to others or themselves.
</p>

<p>"The preacher (says a French author) may spend
an hour in explaining and enforcing a precept of
religion, without feeling any impression from his
own performance, because he may have no further
design than to fill up his hour." A student may
easily exhaust his life in comparing divines and
moralists, without any practical regard to morality
or religion; he may be learning not to live, but to
reason; he may regard only the elegance of style,
justness of argument, and accuracy of method; and
may enable himself to criticise with judgment, and
dispute with subtilty, while the chief use of his
volumes is unthought of, his mind is unaffected,
and his life is unreformed.
</p>

<p>But though truth and virtue are thus frequently
defeated by pride, obstinacy, or folly, we are not
allowed to desert them; for whoever can furnish
arms which they hitherto have not employed, may
enable them to gain some hearts which would have
resisted any other method of attack.  Every man of
genius has some arts of fixing the attention peculiar
to himself, by which, honestly exerted, he may
benefit mankind; for the arguments for purity of
life fail of their due influence, not because they
have been considered and confuted, but because
they have been passed over without consideration.
To the position of Tully, that if Virtue could be

<pb n="200"/>

seen, she must be loved, may be added, that if
Truth could be heard, she must be obeyed.

<p>"THERE is no reputation for genius," says
Quintilian, to be gained by writing on things,
which, however necessary, have little splendour to
shew.  The height of a building attracts the eye, but
the foundations lie without regard.  Yet since there
is not any way to the top of science, but from the
lowest parts, I shall think nothing unconnected
with the art of oratory, which he that wants cannot
be an orator."
</p>

<p>Confirmed and animated by this illustrious precedent,
I shall continue my inquiries into Milton's art
of versification.  Since, however minute the employment
may appear, of analysing lines into syllables,
and whatever ridicule may be incurred by a solemn
deliberation upon accents and pauses, it is certain

<pb n="201"/>

that without this petty knowledge no man can be
a poet; and that from the proper disposition of
single sounds results that harmony that adds force
to reason, and gives grace to sublimity; that shackles
attention, and governs passions.
</p>

<p>That verse may be melodious and pleasing, it is
necessary, not only that the words be so ranged as
that the accent may fall on its proper place, but that
the syllables themselves be so chosen as to flow
smoothly into one another.  This is to be effected by
a proportionate mixture of vowels and consonants,
and by tempering the mute consonants with liquids
and semivowels.  The Hebrew grammarians have
observed, that it is impossible to pronounce two
consonants without the intervention of a vowel, or
without some emission of the breath between one
and the other; this is longer and more perceptible,
as the sounds of the consonants are less harmonically
conjoined, and, by consequence, the flow of the
verse is longer interrupted.
</p>

<p>It is pronounced by Dryden, that a line of monosyllables
is almost always harsh.  This, with regard
to our language, is evidently true, not because
monosyllables cannot compose harmony, but because our
monosyllables, being of Teutonick original, or formed
by contraction, commonly begin and end with consonants,
as,

<q><lg type="poem">
<l>&mdash;Every lower faculty</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch,
taste</hi>.
</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>The difference of harmony arising principally from
the collocation of vowels and consonants, will be

<pb n="202"/>

sufficiently conceived by attending to the following
passages:

<q><lg type="poem">
<l>Immortal <foreign lang="lat" ><hi rend="italic">Amarant</hi></foreign>&mdash;there grows</l>
<l>And flow'rs aloft, shading the fount of life,</l>
<l>And where the river of bliss through midst of heav'n</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Rolls o'er Elysian flow'rs her amber
stream</hi>;</l>
<l>With these that never fade, the spirits elect</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Bind their resplendent locks inwreath'd with
beams</hi>.
</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>The same comparison that I propose to be made
between the fourth and sixth verses of this passage,
may be repeated between the last lines of the following
quotations:

<q><lg type="poem">
<l>&mdash;Under foot the violet,</l>
<l>Crocus, and hyacinth, with rich in-lay</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Broider'd the ground, more colour'd than with
stone</hi>, and yet unspoil'd</l>
<l>Suiana, whose great city <hi rend="italic">Gerion's</hi> sons</l>
<l>Call <hi rend="italic">El Dorado</hi>.&mdash;
</l></lg></q>

<pb n="203"/>


<q><lg type="poem">
<l>The moon&mdash;The <hi rend="italic">Tuscan</hi> artist views</l>
<l>At evening, from the top of <hi rend="italic">Fesole</hi></l>
<l>Or in <hi rend="italic">Valdarno</hi>, to descry new lands.&mdash;
</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>He has indeed been more attentive to his syllables
than to his accents, and does not often offend by
collisions of consonants, or openings of vowels upon
each other, at least not more often than other writers
who have had less important or complicated subjects
to take off their care from the cadence of their lines.
</p>

<p>The great peculiarity of Milton's versification
compared with that of later poets, is the elision of
one vowel before another, or the suppression of the
last syllable of a word ending with a vowel, when a
vowel begins the following word.  As

<q><lg type="poem">
<l>&mdash;Knowledge</l>
<l>Oppresses else with surfeit, and soon turns</l>
<l>Wisdom to folly, as nourishment to wind.
</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>This licence, though now disused in English
poetry, was practised by our old writers, and is allowed
in many other languages ancient and modern,
and therefore the criticks on "Paradise Lost" have,
without much deliberation, commended Milton for
continuing it<ref target="JohRamb.9">[z]</ref>.  But one language cannot communicate
its rules to another.  We have already tried and
rejected the hexometer of the ancients, the double
close of the Italians, and the alexandrine of the
French; and the elision of vowels, however graceful

<pb n="204"/>

it may seem to other nations, may be very unsuitable
to the genius of the English tongue.
</p>

<note id="JohRamb.9"><seg type="note-symbol">[z]</seg> <p>Variation.  "This licence, though an innovation in English poetry,
is yet allowed in many other languages ancient and modern; and therefore
the criticks on Paradise Lost have, without much deliberation,
commended Milton for introducing it." <hi rend="italic">First folio
edition</hi>.</p></note>

<p>There is reason to believe that we have negligently
lost part of our vowels, and that the silent
<hi rend="italic">e</hi> which our ancestors added to most of our monosyllables,
was once vocal.  By this detruncation of our
syllables, our language is overstocked with consonants,
and it is more necessary to add vowels to the
beginning of words, than to cut them off from
the end.
</p>

<p>Milton therefore seems to have somewhat mistaken
the nature of our language, of which the
chief defect is ruggedness and asperity, and has
left our harsh cadences yet harsher.  But his elisions
are not all equally to be censured; in some syllables
they may be allowed, and perhaps in a few may be
safely imitated.  The abscission of a vowel is
undoubtedly vicious when it is strongly sounded, and
makes, with its associate consonant, a full and
audible syllable.

<q><lg type="poem">

</p>


<pb n="205"/>


<p>I believe every reader will agree, that in all
those passages, though not equally in all, the
musick is injured, and in some the meaning obscured.
There are other lines in which the vowel is
cut off, but it is so faintly pronounced in common
speech, that the loss of it in poetry is scarcely
perceived; and therefore such compliance with the
measure may be allowed.

<q><lg type="poem">
<l>&mdash;Nature breeds</l>

<l>To none communica<hi rend="italic">ble</hi> in earth or heav'n.
</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>Yet even these contractions increase the roughness
of a language too rough already; and though
in long poems they may be sometimes suffered, it
never can be faulty to forbear them.
</p>

<p>Milton frequently uses in his poems the hypermetrical
or redundant line of eleven syllables.

<q><lg type="poem">
<l>&mdash;Thus it shall befall</l>
<l>Him who to worth in woman over-trust<hi rend="italic">ing</hi></l>

<q><lg type="poem">

</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>Verses of this kind occur almost in every page;
but though they are not unpleasing or dissonant,
they ought not to be admitted into heroick poetry,
since the narrow limits of our language allow us no
other distinction of epick and tragick measures,
than is afforded by the liberty of changing at will

<pb n="206"/>

the terminations of the dramatick lines, and bringing
them by that relaxation of metrical rigour
nearer to prose.

<p>LOCKE, whom there is no reason to suspect of
being a favourer of idleness or libertinism, has
advanced, that whoever hopes to employ any part
of his time with efficacy and vigour, must allow
some of it to pass in trifles.  It is beyond the powers
of humanity to spend a whole life in profound study
and intense meditation, and the most rigorous exacters
of industry and seriousness have appointed
hours for relaxation and amusement.
</p>

<p>It is certain, that, with or without our consent,
many of the few moments allotted us will slide
imperceptibly away, and that the mind will break,
from confinement to its stated task, into sudden
excursions.  Severe and connected attention is
preserved but for a short time; and when a man shuts
himself up in his closet, and bends his thoughts to
the discussion of any abstruse question, he will find
his faculties continually stealing away to more
pleasing entertainments.  He often perceives himself
transported, he knows not how, to distant tracts of
thought, and returns to his first object as from a
dream, without knowing when he forsook it, or
how long he has been abstracted from it.

<pb n="207"/>

</p>

<p>It has been observed that the most studious are
not always the most learned. There is, indeed, no
great difficulty in discovering that this difference
of proficiency may arise from the difference of
intellectual powers, of the choice of books, or the
convenience of information. But I believe it likewise
frequently happens that the most recluse are not
the most vigorous prosecutors of study. Many impose
upon the world, and many upon themselves,
by an appearance of severe and exemplary diligence,
when they, in reality, give themselves up to the
luxury of fancy, please their minds with regulating
the past, or planning the future; place themselves
at will in varied situations of happiness, and slumber
away their days in voluntary visions. In the journey
of life some are left behind, because they are
naturally feeble and slow; some because they miss
the way, and many because they leave it by choice,
and instead of pressing onward with a steady pace,
delight themselves with momentary deviations,
turn aside to pluck every flower, and repose in
every shade.
</p>

<p>There is nothing more fatal to a man whose business
is to think, than to have learned the art of regaling
his mind with those airy gratifications. Other
vices or follies are restrained by fear, reformed by
admonition, or rejected by the conviction which
the comparison of our conduct with that of others
may in time produce. But this invisible riot of the
mind, this secret prodigality of being, is secure from
detection, and fearless of reproach. The dreamer re-
<pb n="208"/>

tires to his apartments, shuts out the cares and
interruptions of mankind, and abandons himself to
his own fancy; new worlds rise up before him, one
image is followed by another, and a long succession
of delights dances round him. He is at last called
back to life by nature, or by custom, and enters
peevish into society, because he cannot model it to
his own will. He returns from his idle excursions
with the asperity, though not with the knowledge
of a student, and hastens again to the same felicity
with the eagerness of a man bent upon the advancement
of some favourite science. The infatuation
strengthens by degrees, and like the poison of
opiates, weakens his powers, without any external
symptoms of malignity.
</p>

<p>It happens, indeed, that these hypocrites of
learning are in time detected, and convinced by disgrace
and disappointment of the difference between the
labour of thought, and the sport of musing. But
this discovery is often not made till it is too late to
recover the time that has been fooled away. A
thousand accidents may, indeed, awaken drones to
a more early sense of their danger and their shame.
But they who are convinced of the necessity of
breaking from this habitual drowsiness, too often
relapse in spite of their resolution; for these ideal
seducers are always near, and neither any particularity
of time nor place is necessary to their influence;
they invade the soul without warning, and
have often charmed down resistance before their
approach is perceived or suspected.

<pb n="209"/>

</p>

<p>This captivity, however, it is necessary for every
man to break, who has any desire to be wise or useful,
to pass his life with the esteem of others, or to
look back with satisfaction from his old age upon
his earlier years.  In order to regain liberty, he must
find the means of flying from himself; he must, in
opposition to the Stoick precept, teach his desires
to fix upon external things; he must adopt the
joys and the pains of others, and excite in his
mind the want of social pleasures and amicable
communication.
</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, not impossible to promote the cure
of this mental malady, by close application to some
new study, which may pour in fresh ideas, and keep
curiosity in perpetual motion.  But study requires
solitude, and solitude is a state dangerous to those
who are too much accustomed to sink into themselves.
Active employment or public pleasure is
generally a necessary part of this intellectual
regimen, without which, though some remission may
be obtained, a complete cure will scarcely be
effected.
</p>

<p>This is a formidable and obstinate disease of the
intellect, of which, when it has once become radicated
by time, the remedy is one of the hardest
tasks of reason and of virtue.  Its slightest attacks,
therefore, should be watchfully opposed; and he
that finds the frigid and narcotick infection beginning
to seize him, should turn his whole attention
against it, and check it at the first discovery by
proper counteraction.

<pb n="210"/>

</p>

<p>The great resolution to be formed, when happiness
and virtue are thus formidably invaded, is, that
no part of life be spent in a state of neutrality or
indifference; but that some pleasure be found for
every moment that is not devoted to labour; and
that, whenever the necessary business of life grows
irksome or disgusting, an immediate transition be
made to diversion and gaiety.
</p>

<p>After the exercises which the health of the body
requires, and which have themselves a natural tendency
to actuate and invigorate the mind, the most
eligible amusement of a rational being seems to be
that interchange of thoughts which is practised in
free and easy conversation; where suspicion is
banished by experience, and emulation by benevolence;
where every man speaks with no other restraint
than unwillingness to offend, and hears with
no other disposition than desire to be pleased.
</p>

<p>There must be a time in which every man trifles;
and the only choice that nature offers us, is, to trifle
in company or alone.  To join profit with pleasure,
has been an old precept among men who have had
very different conceptions of profit.  All have agreed
that our amusements should not terminate wholly
in the present moment, but contribute more or less
to future advantage.  He that amuses himself among
well-chosen companions, can scarcely fail to receive,
from the most careless and obstreperous merriment
which virtue can allow, some useful hints; nor can
converse on the most familiar topicks without some
casual information.  The loose sparkles of thoughtless

<pb n="211"/>

wit may give new light to the mind, and the gay contention
for paradoxical positions rectify the opinions.
</p>

<p>This is the time in which those friendships that
give happiness or consolation, relief or security, are
generally formed.  A wise and good man is never so
amiable as in his unbended and familiar intervals.
Heroick generosity, or philosophical discoveries,
may compel veneration and respect, but love always
implies some kind of natural or voluntary equality,
and is only to be excited by that levity and
cheerfulness which disencumber all minds from awe and
solicitude, invite the modest to freedom, and exalt
the timorous to confidence.  This easy gaiety is certain
to please, whatever be the character of him
that exerts it; if our superiors descend from their
elevation, we love them for lessening the distance
at which we are placed below them; and inferiors,
from whom we can receive no lasting advantage,
will always keep our affections while their sprightliness
and mirth contribute to our pleasure.
</p>

<p>Every man finds himself differently affected by
the sight of fortresses of war, and palaces of
pleasure; we look on the height and strength of
the bulwarks with a kind of gloomy satisfaction,
for we cannot think of defence without admitting
images of danger, but we range delighted and
jocund through the gay apartments of the palace,
because nothing is impressed by them on the mind
but joy and festivity.  Such is the difference between
great and amiable characters; with protectors we
are safe, with companions we are happy.

</p>

<p>What toil in slender things!
</p>

</epigraph>

<p>
IT is very difficult to write on the minuter parts
of literature without failing either to please or
instruct.  Too much nicety of detail disgusts the
greatest part of readers, and to throw a multitude
of particulars under general heads, and lay down
rules of extensive comprehension, is to common
understandings of little use.  They who undertake
these subjects are therefore always in danger, as
one or other inconvenience arises to their imagination,
of frighting us with rugged science, or
amusing us with empty sound.
</p>

<p>In criticising the work of Milton, there is, indeed,
opportunity to intersperse passages that can hardly
fail to relieve the languors of attention; and since,
in examining the variety and choice of the pauses
with which he has diversified his numbers, it will
be necessary to exhibit the lines in which they are
to be found, perhaps the remarks may be well compensated
by the examples, and the irksomeness of
grammatical disquisitions somewhat alleviated.
</p>

<p>Milton formed his scheme of versification by the
poets of Greece and Rome, whom he proposed to
himself for his models, so far as the difference of his
language from theirs would permit the imitation.
There are indeed many inconveniences inseparable
from our heroick measure compared with that of
Homer and Virgil; inconveniences, which it is no re-
<pb n="213"/>

proach to Milton not to have overcome,because they
are in their own nature insuperable; but against which
he has struggled with so much art and diligence, that
he may at least be said to have deserved success.
</p>

<p>The hexameter of the ancients may be considered
as consisting of fifteen syllables, so melodiously
disposed, that, as every one knows who has examined
the poetical authors, very pleasing and sonorous
lyrick measures are formed from the fragments of
the heroick.  It is, indeed, scarce possible to break
them in such a manner but that <foreign lang="lat" ><hi rend="italic">invenias etiam disjecti
membra poet&aelig;</hi></foreign>, some harmony will still remain,
and the due proportions of sound will always be
discovered.  This measure therefore allowed great
variety of pauses, and great liberties of connecting
one verse with another, because wherever the line
was interrupted, either part singly was musical.
But the ancients seem to have confined this privilege
to hexameters; for in their other measures,
though longer than the English heroick, those who
wrote after the refinements of versification, venture
so seldom to change their pauses, that every variation
may be supposed rather a compliance with
necessity than the choice of judgment.
</p>

<p>Milton was constrained within the narrow limits
of a measure not very harmonious in the utmost
perfection; the single parts, therefore, into which it
was to be sometimes broken by pauses, were in
danger of losing the very form of verse.  This has,
perhaps, notwithstanding all his care, sometimes
happened{.}

<pb n="214"/>

</p>

<p>As harmony is the end of poetical measures, no
part of a verse ought to be so separated from the
rest as not to remain still more harmonious than
prose, or to show, by the disposition of the tones,
that it is part of a verse.  This rule in the old
hexameter might be easily observed, but in English will
very frequently be in danger of violation; for the
order and regularity of accents cannot well be perceived
in a succession of fewer than three syllables,
which will confine the English poet to only five
pauses; it being supposed, that when he connects
one line with another, he should never make a full
pause at less distance than that of three syllables
from the beginning or end of a verse.
</p>

<p>That this rule should be universally and
indispensably established, perhaps cannot be granted;
something may be allowed to variety, and something
to the adaptation of the numbers to the
subject; but it will be found generally necessary,
and the ear will seldom fail to suffer by its neglect.
</p>

<p>Thus when a single syllable is cut off from the
rest, it must either be united to the line with which
the sense connects it, or be sounded alone.  If it be
united to the other line, it corrupts its harmony; if
disjoined, it must stand alone, and with regard to
musick be superfluous; for there is no harmony in a
single sound, because it has no proportion to another.

<l>&mdash;Hypocrites austerely talk</l>
<l>Defaming as impure what God declares</l>
<l><hi rend="italic">Pure</hi>; and commands to some, leaves free to all.
</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>When two syllables likewise are abscinded from


<pb n="215"/>


the rest, they evidently want some associate sounds
to make them harmonious.

<q><lg type="poem">
<l> &mdash;Eyes&mdash;</l>

gray</hi></l>
<l> Dawn, and the Pleiades, before him danc'd,</l>
<l> Shedding sweet influence.
</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>The same defect is perceived in the following
line, where the pause is at the second syllable from
the beginning.

<q><lg type="poem">
<l>&mdash;The race</l>
<l> Of what wild rout that tore the Thracian bard</l>
<l> In Rhodope, where woods and rocks had ears</l>
<l> To rapture, 'till the savage clamour drown'd</l>
<l> Both harp and voice; nor could the muse defend</l>
<l> <hi rend="italic">Her son</hi>.  So fail not thou, who thee implores.
</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>When the pause falls upon the third syllable or
the seventh, the harmony is the better preserved;
but as the third and seventh are weak syllables, the
period leaves the ear unsatisfied, and in expectation
of the remaining part of the verse.

<q><lg type="poem">
<l>&mdash;He, with his horrid crew,</l>
<l> Lay vanquish'd, rolling in the fiery gulph,</l>
<l> Confounded though immor<hi rend="italic">tal</hi>.  But his doom</l>

<l> On errands of supernal grace.  So sung</l>
<l> The glorious train ascending.
</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>It may be, I think, established as a rule, that a
pause which concludes a period should be made for
the most part upon a strong syllable, as the fourth
and sixth; but those pauses which only suspend the
sense may be placed upon the weaker.  Thus the
rest in the third line of the first passage satisfies
the ear better than in the fourth, and the close of
the second quotation better than of the third.

<q><lg type="poem">
<l>&mdash;The evil soon</l>

</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>The rest in the fifth place has the same inconvenience
as in the seventh and third, that the syllable
is weak.

<q><lg type="poem">
<l> Beast now with beast 'gan war, and fowl with fowl,</l>
<l> And fish with fish, to graze the herb all leaving,</l>

</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>The noblest and most majestick pauses which
our versification admits, are upon the fourth and

<pb n="217"/>

sixth syllables, which are both strongly sounded in
a pure and regular verse, and at either of which the
line is so divided, that both members participate of
harmony.

<q><lg type="poem">

<l> Her farthest verge, and chaos to retire.
</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>But far above all others, if I can give any credit
to my own ear, is the rest upon the sixth syllable,
which, taking in a complete compass of sound,
such as is sufficient to constitute one of our lyrick
measures, makes a full and solemn close.  Some
passages which conclude at this stop, I could never
read without some strong emotions of delight or
admiration.

<q><lg type="poem">

</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>If the poetry of Milton be examined, with regard
to the pauses and flow of his verses into each other,
it will appear, that he has performed all that our

<pb n="218"/>

language would admit; and the comparison of his
numbers with those who have cultivated the same
manner of writing, will show that he excelled as
lnuch in the lower as the higher parts of his art, and
that his skill in harmony was not less than his invention
or his learning.

<p>THE Sciences having long seen their votaries
labouring for the benefit of mankind without
reward, put up their petition to Jupiter for a more
equitable distribution of riches and honours.  Jupiter
was moved at their complaints, and touched
with the approaching miseries of men, whom the
Sciences, wearied with perpetual ingratitude, were
now threatening to forsake, and who would have
been reduced by their departure to feed in dens
upon the mast of trees, to hunt their prey in deserts,
and to perish under the paws of animals stronger
and fiercer than themselves.
</p>

<p>A synod of the celestials was therefore convened,
in which it was resolved, that Patronage should
descend to the assistance of the Sciences.  Patronage
was the daughter of Astrea, by a mortal father, and
had been educated in the school of Truth, by the
Goddesses, whom she was now appointed to pro-
<pb n="219"/>

tect.  She had from her mother that dignity of
aspect, which struck terrour into false merit, and
from her mistress that reserve, which made her
only accessible to those whom the Sciences brought
into her presence.
</p>

<p>She came down, with the general acclamation of
all the powers that favour learning.  Hope danced
before her, and Liberality stood at her side, ready
to scatter by her direction the gifts which Fortune,
who followed her, was commanded to supply.  As
she advanced towards Parnassus, the cloud which
had long hung over it, was immediately dispelled.
The shades, before withered with drought, spread
their original verdure, and the flowers that had languished
with chillness brightened their colours, and
invigorated their scents; the Muses tuned their
harps, and exerted their voices; and all the concert
of nature welcomed her arrival.
</p>

<p>On Parnassus she fixed her residence, in a palace
raised by the Sciences, and adorned with whatever
could delight the eye, elevate the imagination, or
enlarge the understanding.  Here she dispersed the
gifts of Fortune with the impartiality of Justice,
and the discernment of Truth.  Her gate stood
always open, and Hope sat at the portal, inviting
to entrance all whom the Sciences numbered in
their train.  The court was therefore thronged with
innumerable multitudes, of whom, though many
returned disappointed, seldom any had confidence
to complain; for Patronage was known to neglect
few, but for want of the due claims to her regard.

<pb n="220"/>

Those, therefore, who had solicited her favour without
success, generally withdrew from publick notice,
and either diverted their attention to meaner
employments, or endeavoured to supply their
deficiencies by closer application.
</p>

<p>In time, however, the number of those who had
miscarried in their pretensions grew so great, that
they became less ashamed of their repulses; and instead
of hiding their disgrace in retirement, began
to besiege the gates of the palace, and obstruct the
entrance of such as they thought likely to be more
caressed.  The decisions of Patronage, who was but
half a Goddess, had been sometimes erroneous; and
though she always made haste to rectify her mistakes,
a few instances of her fallibility encouraged
every one to appeal from her judgment to his own
and that of his companions, who are always ready
to clamour in the common cause, and elate each
other with reciprocal applause.
</p>

<p>Hope was a steady friend of the disappointed,
and Impudence incited them to accept a second invitation,
and lay their claim again before Patronage.
They were again, for the most part, sent back with
ignominy, but found Hope not alienated, and Impudence
more resolutely zealous; they therefore
contrived new expedients, and hoped at last to
prevail by their multitudes, which were always
increasing, and their perseverance, which Hope and
Impudence forbad them to relax.
</p>

<p>Patronage having been long a stranger to the
heavenly assemblies, began to degenerate towards

<pb n="221"/>

terrestrial nature, and forget the precepts of Justice
and Truth.  Instead of confining her friendship to
the Sciences, she suffered herself, by little and little,
to contract an acquaintance with Pride, the son
of Falsehood, by whose embraces she had two
daughters, Flattery and Caprice.  Flattery was
nursed by Liberality, and Caprice by Fortune,
without any assistance from the lessons of the
Sciences.
</p>

<p>Patronage began openly to adopt the sentiments
and imitate the manners of her husband, by whose
opinions she now directed her decisions with very
little heed to the precepts of Truth; and as her
daughters continually gained upon her affections,
the Sciences lost their influence, till none found
much reason to boast of their reception, but those
whom Caprice or Flattery conducted to her throne.
</p>

<p>The throngs who had so long waited, and so often
been dismissed for want of recommendation from
the Sciences, were delighted to see the power of
those rigourous Goddesses tending to its extinction.
Their patronesses now renewed their encouragements.
Hope smiled at the approach of Caprice,
and Impudence was always at hand to introduce
her clients to Flattery.
</p>

<p>Patronage had now learned to procure herself
reverence by ceremonies and formalities, and, instead
of admitting her petitioners to an immediate
audience, ordered the ante-chamber to be erected,
called among mortals, the <hi rend="italic">Hall of Expectation</hi>.
Into this hall the entrance was easy to those whom

<pb n="222"/>

Impudence had consigned to Flattery, and it was
therefore crowded with a promiscuous throng,
assembled from every corner of the earth, pressing
forward with the utmost eagerness of desire, and
agitated with all the anxieties of competition.
</p>

<p>They entered this general receptacle with ardour
and alacrity, and made no doubt of speedy access,
under the conduct of Flattery, to the presence of
Patronage.  But it generally happened that they
were here left to their destiny, for the inner doors
were committed to Caprice, who opened and shut
them, as it seemed, by chance, and rejected or admitted
without any settled rule of distinction.  In
the mean time, the miserable attendants were left
to wear out their lives in alternate exultation and
dejection, delivered up to the sport of Suspicion,
who was always whispering into their ear designs
against them which were never formed, and of Envy,
who diligently pointed out the good fortune of
one or other of their competitors.  Infamy flew
round the hall, and scattered mildews from her
wings, with which every one was stained; Reputation
followed her with slower flight, and endeavoured
to hide the blemishes with paint, which was immediately
brushed away, or separated of itself, and
left the stains more visible; nor were the spots of
Infamy ever effaced, but with limpid water effused
by the hand of Time from a well which sprung up
beneath the throne of Truth.
</p>

<p>It frequently happened that Science, unwilling
to lose the ancient prerogative of recommending to

<pb n="223"/>

Patronage, would lead her followers into the Hall
of Expectation; but they were soon discouraged
from attending, for not only Envy and Suspicion
incessantly tormented them, but Impudence considered
them as intruders, and incited Infamy to
blacken them.  They therefore quickly retired, but
seldom without some spots which they could scarcely
wash away, and which shewed that they had once
waited in the Hall of Expectation.
</p>

<p>The rest continued to expect the happy moment,
at which Caprice should beckon them to approach;
and endeavoured to propitiate her, not with Homerical
harmony, the representation of great actions,
or the recital of noble sentiments, but with soft and
voluptuous melody, intermingled with the praises
of Patronage and Pride, by whom they were heard
at once with pleasure and contempt.
</p>

<p>Some were indeed admitted by Caprice, when
they least expected it, and heaped by Patronage
with the gifts of Fortune, but they were from that
time chained to her footstool, and condemned to
regulate their lives by her glances and her nods:
they seemed proud of their manacles, and seldom
complained of any drudgery, however servile, or
any affront, however contemptuous; yet they were
often, notwithstanding their obedience, seized on a
sudden by Caprice, divested of their ornaments, and
thrust back into the Hall of Expectation.
</p>

<p>Here they mingled again with the tumult, and
all, except a few whom experience had taught to
seek happiness in the regions of liberty, continued

<pb n="224"/>


{illust. caption = Painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds, P.R.A.
 R. B. SHERIDAN}


to spend hours, and days, and years, courting the
smile of Caprice by the arts of Flattery; till at
length new crowds pressed in upon them, and drove
them forth at different outlets into the habitations
of Disease, and Shame, and Poverty, and Despair,
where they passed the rest of their lives in narratives
of promises and breaches of faith, of joys and
sorrows, of hopes and disappointments.
</p>

<p>The Sciences, after a thousand indignities,
retired from the palace of Patronage, and having
long wandered over the world in grief and distress
were led at last to the cottage of Independence,
the daughter of Fortitude; where they were taught
by Prudence and Parsimony to support themselves
in dignity and quiet.

<p>IT has been long observed, that the idea of beauty
is vague and undefined, different in different
minds, and diversified by time or place.  It has been
a term hitherto used to signify that which pleases
us we know not why, and in our approbation of
which we can justify ourselves only by the concurrence
of numbers, without much power of en-
<pb n="225"/>

forcing our opinion upon others by any argument
but example and authority.  It is, indeed, so little
subject to the examinations of reason, that Paschal
supposes it to end where demonstration begins, and
maintains, that without incongruity and absurdity
we cannot speak of <hi rend="italic">geometrical beauty</hi>.
</p>

<p>To trace all the sources of that various pleasure
which we ascribe to the agency of beauty, or to disentangle
all the perceptions involved in its idea,
would, perhaps, require a very great part of the life
of Aristotle or Plato.  It is, however, in many cases
apparent, that this quality is merely relative and
comparative; that we pronounce things beautiful
because they have something which we agree, for
whatever reason, to call beauty, in a greater degree
than we have been accustomed to find it in other
things of the same kind; and that we transfer the
epithet as our knowledge increases, and appropriate
it to higher excellence, when higher excellence
comes within our view.
</p>

<p>Much of the beauty of writing is of this kind;
and therefore Boileau justly remarks, that the books
which have stood the test of time, and been admired
through all the changes which the mind of man has
suffered from the various revolutions of knowledge,
and the prevalence of contrary customs, have a better
claim to our regard than any modern can boast,
because the long continuance of their reputation
proves that they are adequate to our faculties, and
agreeable to nature.
</p>

<p>It is, however, the task of criticism to establish

<pb n="226"/>

principles; to improve opinion into knowledge; and
to distinguish those means of pleasing which depend
upon known causes and rational deduction, from the
nameless and inexplicable elegancies which appeal
wholly to the fancy, from which we feel delight,
but know not how they produce it, and which may
well be termed the enchantresses of the soul.
Criticism reduces those regions of literature under
the dominion of science, which have hitherto known
only the anarchy of ignorance, the caprices of fancy,
and the tyranny of prescription.
</p>

<p>There is nothing in the art of versifying so much
exposed to the power of imagination as the accommodation
of the sound to the sense, or the representation
of particular images, by the flow of the
verse in which they are expressed.  Every student
has innumerable passages, in which he, and perhaps
he alone, discovers such resemblances; and since
the attention of the present race of poetical readers
seems particularly turned upon this species of elegance,
I shall endeavour to examine how much these
conformities have been observed by the poets, or
directed by the criticks, how far they can be established
upon nature and reason, and on what occasions
they have been practised by Milton.
</p>

<p>Homer, the father of all poetical beauty, has been
particularly celebrated by Dionysius of Halicarnassus,
as "he that, of all the poets, exhibited the
greatest variety of sound; for there are," says he,
"innumerable passages, in which length of time,
bulk of body, extremity of passion, and stillness of

<pb n="227"/>

repose; or, in which, on the contrary, brevity, speed,
and eagerness, are evidently marked out by the sound
of the syllables.  Thus the anguish and slow pace
with which the blind <hi rend="italic">Polypheme</hi> groped out with
his hands the entrance of his cave, are perceived
in the cadence of the verses which describe it."</p>

<p>Many other examples Dionysius produces; but
these will sufficiently shew, that either he was fanciful,
or we have lost the genuine pronunciation;
for I know not whether, in any one of these instances,
such similitude can be discovered.  It seems,
indeed, probable, that the veneration with which
Homer was read, produced many suppositious
beauties: for though it is certain, that the sound of
many of his verses very justly corresponds with the
things expressed, yet, when the force of his imagination,
which gave him full possession of every
object, is considered, together with the flexibility
of his language, of which the syllables might be
often contracted or dilated at pleasure, it will seem
unlikely that such conformity should happen less
frequently even without design.
</p>

<p>It is not however to be doubted, that Virgil, who
wrote amidst the light of criticism, and who owed
so much of his success to art and labour, endeavoured,
among other excellencies, to exhibit this
similitude; nor has he been less happy in this than
in the other graces of versification.  This felicity of
his numbers was, at the revival of learning, dis-

played with great elegance by Vida, in his Art
of Poetry.

<p>From the Italian gardens Pope seems to have


<pb n="232"/>


transplanted this flower, the growth of happier
climates, into a soil less adapted to its nature, and
less favourable to its increase.

<q><lg type="poem">
<l> Soft is the strain, when Zephyr gentle blows,</l>
<l> And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows;</l>
<l> But when loud billows lash the sounding shore,</l>
<l> The hoarse rough verse should like the torrent roar.</l>
<l> When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,</l>
<l> The line too labours, and the words move slow</l>
<l> Nor so when swift Camilla scours the plain</l>
<l> Flies o'er th' unbending corn, and skims along the main.
</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>From these lines, laboured with attention, and
celebrated by a rival wit, may be judged what can
be expected from the most diligent endeavours
after this imagery of sound.  The verse intended to
represent the whisper of the vernal breeze, must be
confessed not much to excel in softness or volubility:
and the smooth stream runs with a perpetual clash
of jarring consonants.  The noise and turbulence of
the torrent, is, indeed, distinctly imaged, for it requires
very little skill to make our language rough:
but in these lines, which mention the effort of Ajax,
there is no particular heaviness, obstruction, or
delay.  The swiftness of Camilla is rather contrasted
than exemplified; why the verse should be lengthened
to express speed, will not easily be discovered.
In the dactyls used for that purpose by the ancients,
two short syllables were pronounecd with such
rapidity, as to be equal only to one long; they,
therefore, naturally exhibit the act of passing
through a long space in a short time.  But the
Alexandrine, by its pause in the midst, is a tardy

<pb n="233"/>

and stately measure; and the word <hi rend="italic">unbending</hi>, one
of the most sluggish and slow which our language
affords, cannot much accelerate its motion.
</p>

<p>These rules and these examples have taught our
present criticks to inquire very studiously and
minutely into sounds and cadences.  It is, therefore,
useful to examine with what skill they have proceeded;
what discoveries they have made; and
whether any rules can be established which may
guide us hereafter in such researches.

</l>

</lg>

</epigraph>

<p>THERE are few books on which more time is
spent by young students, than on treatises
which deliver the characters of authors; nor any
which oftener deceive the expectation of the reader,
or fill his mind with more opinions which the progress
of his studies and the increase of his knowledge
oblige him to resign.
</p>

<p>Baillet has introduced his collection of the decisions
of the learned, by an enumeration of the
prejudices which mislead the critick, and raise the
passions in rebellion against the judgment.  His
catalogue, though large, is imperfect; and who can
hope to complete it? The beauties of writing have
been observed to be often such as cannot in the

<pb n="234"/>

present state of human knowledge be evinced by
evidence, or drawn out into demonstrations; they
are therefore wholly subject to the imagination, and
do not force their effects upon a mind pre-occupied
by unfavourable sentiments, nor overcome the counteraction
of a false principle or of stubborn partiality.
</p>

<p>To convince any man against his will is hard, but to
please him against his will is justly pronounced by
Dryden to be above the reach of human abilities.  Interest
and passion will hold out long against the closest
siege of diagrams and syllogisms, but they are absolutely
impregnable to imagery and sentiment; and
will for ever bid defiance to the most powerful strains
of Virgil or Homer, though they may give way in
time to the batteries of Euclid or Archimedes.
</p>

<p>In trusting therefore to the sentence of a critick,
we are in danger not only from that vanity which
exalts writers too often to the dignity of teaching
what they are yet to learn, from that negligence
which sometimes steals upon the most vigilant
caution, and that fallibility to which the condition
of nature has subjected every human understanding;
but from a thousand extrinsick and accidental causes,
from every thing which can excite kindness or
malevolence, veneration or contempt.
</p>

<p>Many of those who have determined with great
boldness upon the various degrees of literary merit,
may be justly suspected of having passed sentence,
as Seneca remarks of Claudius,

<q><lg type="poem" lang="lat" >
<l> Una tantum parte audita,</l>
<l> Sape et nulla,
</l></lg></q>


<pb n="235"/>


without much knowledge of the cause before them:
for it will not easily be imagined of Langbaine,
Borrichius, or Rapin, that they had very accurately
perused all the books which they praise or censure:
or that, even if nature and learning had qualified them
for judges, they could read for ever with the attention
necessary to just criticism.  Such performances,
however, are not wholly without their use; for they
are commonly just echoes to the voice of fame, and
transmit the general suffrage of mankind when they
have no particular motives to suppress it.
</p>

<p>Criticks, like the rest of mankind, are very frequently
misled by interest.  The bigotry with which
editors regard the authors whom they illustrate or
correct, has been generally remarked.  Dryden was
known to have written most of his critical dissertations
only to recommend the work upon which he
then happened to be employed: and Addison is
suspected to have denied the expediency of poetical
justice, because his own Cato was condemned
to perish in a good cause.
</p>

<p>There are prejudices which authors, not otherwise
weak or corrupt, have indulged without scruple; and
perhaps some of them are so complicated with our
natural affections, that they cannot easily be disentangled
from the heart.  Scarce any can hear with
impartiality a comparison between the writers of his
own and another country; and though it cannot, I
think, be charged equally on all nations, that they
are blinded with this literary patriotism, yet there
are none that do not look upon their authors with

<pb n="236"/>

the fondness of affinity, and esteem them as well for
the place of their birth, as for their knowledge or
their wit.  There is, therefore, seldom much respect
due to comparative criticism, when the competitors
are of different countries, unless the judge is of a
nation equally indifferent to both.  The Italians could
not for a long time believe, that there was any learning
beyond the mountains; and the French seem
generally persuaded, that there are no wits or
reasoners equal to their own.  I can scarcely conceive
that if Scaliger had not considered himself as allied
to Virgil, by being born in the same country, he
would have found his works so much superior to
those of Homer, or have thought the controversy
worthy of so much zeal, vehemence, and acrimony.
</p>

<p>There is, indeed, one prejudice, and only one, by
which it may be doubted whether it is any dishonour
to be sometimes misguided.  Criticism has so often
given occasion to the envious and ill-natured of
gratifying their malignity, that some have thought
it necessary to recommend the virtue of candour
without restriction, and to preclude all future liberty
of censure.  Writers possessed with this opinion
are continually enforcing civility and decency,
recommending to criticks the proper diffidence of
themselves, and inculcating the veneration due to
celebrated names.
</p>

<p>I am not of opinion that these professed enemies
of arrogance and severity have much more benevolence
or modesty than the rest of mankind; or that
they feel in their own hearts, any other intention

<pb n="237"/>

than to distinguish themselves by their softness and
delicacy.  Some are modest because they are timorous,
and some are lavish of praise because they hope
to be repaid.
</p>

<p>There is indeed some tenderness due to living
writers, when they attack none of those truths
which are of importance to the happiness of mankind,
and have committed no other offence than
that of betraying their own ignorance or dulness.  I
should think it cruelty to crush an insect who had
provoked me only by buzzing in my ear; and would
not willingly interrupt the dream of harmless
stupidity, or destroy the jest which makes its author
laugh.  Yet I am far from thinking this tenderness
universally necessary; for he that writes may be
considered as a kind of general challenger, whom
every one has a right to attack; since he quits the
common rank of life, steps forward beyond the lists,
and offers his merit to the publick judgment.  To
commence author is to claim praise, and no man
can justly aspire to honour, but at the hazard of
disgrace.
</p>

<p>But whatever be decided concerning contemporaries,
whom he that knows the treachery of the
human heart, and considers how often we gratify
our own pride or envy under the appearance of
contending for elegance and propriety, will find
himself not much inclined to disturb; there can
surely be no exemptions pleaded to secure them
from criticism, who can no longer suffer by reproach,
and of whom nothing now remains but their writ-
<pb n="238"/>

ings and their names.  Upon these authors the critick
is undoubtedly at full liberty to exercise the strictest
severity, since he endangers only his own fame,
and, like &AElig;neas when he drew his sword in the
infernal regions, encounters phantoms which cannot
be wounded.  He may indeed pay some regard to
established reputation; but he can by that shew of
reverence consult only his own security, for all
other motives are now at an end.
</p>

<p>The faults of a writer of acknowledged excellence
are more dangerous, because the influence of his
example is more extensive; and the interest of
learning requires that they should be discovered
and stigmatized, before they have the sanction of
antiquity conferred upon them, and become precedents
of indisputable authority.
</p>

<p>It has, indeed, been advanced by Addison, as one
of the characteristicks of a true critick, that he
points out beauties rather than faults.  But it is
rather natural to a man of learning and genius to
apply himself chiefly to the study of writers who
have more beauties than faults to be displayed: for
the duty of criticism is neither to depreciate, nor
dignify by partial representations, but to hold out
the light of reason, whatever it may discover; and
to promulgate the determinations of truth, whatever
she shall dictate.

</epigraph>

<p>THE resemblance of poetick numbers, to the
subject which they mention or describe, may be
considered as general or particular; as consisting in
the flow and structure of a whole passage taken
together, or as comprised in the sound of some
emphatical and descriptive words, or in the cadence
and harmony of single verses.
</p>

<p>The general resemblance of the sound to the
sense is to be found in every language which admits
of poetry, in every author whose force of fancy enables
him to impress images strongly on his own
mind, and whose choice and variety of language
readily supply him with just representations.  To
such a writer it is natural to change his measure
with his subject, even without any effort of the
understanding, or intervention of the judgment.
To revolve jollity and mirth necessarily tunes the
voice of a poet to gay and sprightly notes, as it
fires his eye with vivacity; and reflection on gloomy
situations and disastrous events, will sadden his
numbers, as it will cloud his countenance.  But in
such passages there is only the similitude of pleasure
to pleasure, and of grief to grief, without any

<pb n="240"/>

immediate application to particular images.  The
same flow of joyous versification will celebrate the
jollity of marriage, and the exultation of triumph;
and the same languor of melody will suit the complaints
of an absent lover, as of a conquered king.
</p>

<p>It is scarcely to be doubted, that on many
occasions we make the musick which we imagine
ourselves to hear, that we modulate the poem by our
own disposition, and ascribe to the numbers the
effects of the sense.  We may observe in life, that it
is not easy to deliver a pleasing message in an
unpleasing manner, and that we readily associate
beauty and deformity with those whom for any
reason we love or hate.  Yet it would be too daring
to declare that all the celebrated adaptations of
harmony are chimerical; that Homer had no extraordinary
attention to the melody of his verse
when he described a nuptial festivity;</p>

Or that Milton did not intend to exemplify the
harmony which he mentions:

<q><lg type="poem">
<l> Fountains! and ye that warble as ye flow,</l>
<l> Melodious murmurs! warbling tune his praise.
</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>That Milton understood the force of sounds well
adjusted, and knew the compass and variety of the
ancient measures, cannot be doubted; since he was
both a musician and a critick; but he seems to have
considered these conformities of cadence, as either
not often attainable in our language, or as petty
excellencies unworthy of his ambition; for it will
not be found that he has always assigned the same
cast of numbers to the same objects.  He has given
in two passages very minute descriptions of angelic
beauty; but though the images are nearly the same,
the numbers will be found, upon comparison, very
different:

<q><lg type="poem">
<l> And now a stripling cherub he appears,</l>
<l> Not of the prime, yet such as in his face</l>
<l> Youth smil'd celestial, and to every limb</l>

<l> <hi rend="italic">In curls on either cheek play'd: wings he
wore</hi></l>
<l><hi rend="italic"> Of many a colour'd plume, sprinkled with gold</hi>.
</l></lg></q>

Some of the lines of this description are remarkably
defective in harmony, and therefore by no means
correspondent with that symmetrical elegance and
easy grace, which they are intended to exhibit.
The failure, however, is fully compensated by the

<pb n="242"/>

representation of Raphael, which equally delights
the ear and imagination:

<q><lg type="poem">
<l> A seraph wing'd: six wings he wore to shade</l>
<l> His lineaments divine; the pair that clad</l>
<l> Each shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast</l>
<l> With regal ornament: the middle pair</l>
<l> Girt like a starry zone his waist, and round</l>
<l> Skirted his loins and thighs, with downy gold,</l>
<l> And colours dipp'd in heav'n; the third his feet</l>
<l> Shadow'd from either heel with feather'd mail,</l>
<l> Sky-tinctur'd grain! like Maia's son he stood,</l>
<l> And shook his plumes, that heav'nly fragrance fill'd</l>
<l> The circuit wide.&mdash;
</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>The adumbration of particular and distinct images
by an exact and perceptible resemblance of sound,
is sometimes studied, and sometimes casual.  Every
language has many words formed in imitation of
the noises which they signify.  Such are <foreign>
<hi rend="italic">stridor</hi></foreign>,
<foreign ><hi rend="italic">balo</hi></foreign>, and <foreign>
<hi rend="italic">beatas</hi></foreign>, in
Latin; and in English to <hi rend="italic">growl</hi>,
to <hi rend="italic">buzz</hi>, to <hi rend="italic">hiss</hi>, and to
<hi rend="italic">jarr</hi>.  Words of this kind give
to a verse the proper similitude of sound, without
much labour of the writer, and such happiness is
therefore to be attributed rather to fortune than
skill; yet they are sometimes combined with great
propriety, and undeniably contribute to enforce the
impression of the idea.  We hear the passing arrow
in this line of Virgil;

<q><l lang="lat" >Et fugit <hi rend="roman">horrendum
stridens</hi> elapsa sagitta;</l></q>

<q><l>Th' impetuous arrow whizzes on the wing.</l><bibl>POPE.</bibl></q>

And the creaking of hell-gates, in the description
by Milton;

<q><lg type="poem">
<l> &mdash;Open fly</l>
<l> With impetuous recoil and jarring sound</l>
<l> Th' infernal doors: and on their hinges grate</l>
<l> Harsh thunder.&mdash;
</l></lg></q>

</p>

<pb n="243"/>

<p>But many beauties of this kind, which the
moderns, and perhaps the ancients, have observed,
seem to be the product of blind reverence acting
upon fancy.  Dionysius himself tells us, that the
sound of Homer's verses sometimes exhibits the
idea of corporeal bulk.  Is not this a discovery nearly
approaching to that of the blind man, who, after
long inquiry into the nature of the scarlet colour,
found that it represented nothing so much as the
clangour of a trumpet? The representative power of
poetick harmony consists of sound and measure;
of the force of the syllables singly considered, and
of the time in which they are pronounced.  Sound
can resemble nothing but sound, and time can
measure nothing but motion and duration.
</p>

<p>The criticks, however, have struck out other
similitudes; nor is there any irregularity of numbers
which credulous admiration cannot discover to be
eminently beautiful.  Thus the propriety of each of
these lines has been celebrated by writers whose
opinion the world has reason to regard:

<q lang="lat" >

Vertitur interea coelum, et ruit oceano nox.

</q>

<q><lg type="poem">
<l>Meantime the rapid heav'ns rowl'd down the light,</l>
<l> And on the shaded ocean rush'd the night.
</l>
<byline>DRYDEN.
</byline></lg></q>

<q lang="lat" >Sternitur, exanimisque
tremens procumbit humik bos.&mdash;</q>

<q><lg type="poem">
<l> Down drops the beast, nor needs a second wound;</l>
<l> But sprawls in pangs of death, and spurns the ground.
</l>
<byline>DRYDEN.
</byline></lg></q>

<q lang="lat" >Parturiunt montes, nascetur
ridiculus mus.&mdash;</q>

<q>The mountains labour, and a mouse is born.<bibl>ROSCOMMON.</bibl></q>

If all these observations are just, there must be
some remarkable conformity between the sudden

<pb n="244"/>

succession of night to day, the fall of an ox under a
blow, and the birth of a mouse from a mountain;
since we are told of all these images, that they are
very strongly impressed by the same form and
termination of the verse.
</p>

<p>We may, however, without giving way to enthusiasm,
admit that some beauties of this kind
may be produced.  A sudden stop at an unusual
syllable may image the cessation of action, or the
pause of discourse; and Milton has very happily
imitated the repetitions of an echo:

<q><lg type="poem">
<l> I fled, and cried out <hi rend="italic">death</hi>:</l>
<l> Hell trembled at the hedious name, and sigh'd</l>
<l> From all her caves, and back resounded <hi rend="italic">death</hi>.
</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>The measure of time in pronouncing may be varied
so as very strongly to represent, not only the modes
of external motion, but the quick or slow succession
of ideas, and consequently the passions of the mind.
This at least was the power of the spondaick and
dactylick harmony, but our language can reach no
eminent diversities of sound.  We can indeed sometimes,
by encumbering and retarding the line, shew
the difficulty of a progress made by strong efforts
and with frequent interruptions, or mark a slow and
heavy motion.  Thus Milton has imaged the toil of
Satan struggling through chaos;

<q><lg type="poem">
<l> So he with difficulty and labour hard</l>
<l> Mov'd on: with difficulty and labour he.&mdash;
</l></lg></q>

Thus he has described the leviathans or whales;

<q>

 Wallowing unwieldy, enormous in their gait.

</q>


But he has at other times neglected such represen-
<pb n="245"/>

tations, as may be observed in the volubility and
levity of these lines, which express an action tardy
and reluctant.

<q><lg type="poem">
<l> &mdash;Descent and fall</l>
<l> To us is adverse.  Who but felt of late,</l>
<l> When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear</l>
<l> Insulting, and pursu'd us through the deep,</l>
<l> With what confusion and laborious flight</l>
<l> We sunk thus low? Th' ascent is easy then.
</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>In another place, he describes the gentle glide
of ebbing waters in a line remarkably rough and
halting;

<q><lg type="poem">
<l> &mdash;Tripping ebb; that stole</l>
<l> With soft foot tow'rds the deep who now had stopp'd</l>
<l> His sluices.
</l></lg></q>

</p>

<p>It is not, indeed, to be expected, that the sound
should always assist the meaning, but it ought never
to counteract it; and therefore Milton has here certainly
committed a fault like that of a player, who
looked on the earth when he implored the heavens,
and to the heavens when he addressed the earth.
</p>

<p>Those who are determined to find in Milton an
assemblage of all the excellencies which have ennobled
all other poets, will perhaps be offended that
I do not celebrate his versification in higher terms;
for there are readers who discover that in this
passage,

<q>

 So stretch'd out huge in length the arch-fiend lay,

</q>

a <hi rend="italic">long</hi> form is described in a <hi
rend="italic">long</hi> line; but the truth
is, that length of body is only mentioned in a <hi
rend="italic">slow</hi>
line, to which it has only the resemblance of time
to space, of an hour to a maypole.

<pb n="246"/>

</p>

<p>The same turn of ingenuity might perform wonders
upon the description of the ark:

<q><lg type="poem">
<l> Then from the mountains hewing timber tall,</l>
<l> Began to build a vessel of huge bulk;</l>
<l> Measur'd by cubit, length, and breadth, and height.
</l></lg></q>

In these lines the poet apparently designs to fix
the attention upon bulk; but this is effected by the
enumeration, not by the measure; for what analogy
can there be between modulations of sound, and
corporeal dimensions?
</p>

<p>Milton indeed seems only to have regarded this
species of embellishment so far as not to reject it
when it came unsought; which would often happen
to a mind so vigorous, employed upon a subject so
various and extensive.  He had, indeed, a greater
and nobler work to perform; a single sentiment of
moral or religious truth, a single image of life or
nature, would have been cheaply lost for a thousand
echoes of the cadence of the sense; and he who had
undertaken to <hi rend="italic">vindicate the ways of God to
man</hi>,
might have been accused of neglecting his cause,
had he lavished much of his attention upon syllables
and sounds.

TO THE RAMBLER.<lb/>

<salute>SIR,
</salute>

</opener>

<p>
THERE are many diseases both of the body and
mind, which it is far easier to prevent than to
cure, and therefore I hope you will think me employed
in an office not useless either to learning or
virtue, if I describe the symptoms of an intellectual
malady, which, though at first it seizes only the
passions, will, if not speedily remedied, infect the
reason, and, from blasting the blossoms of knowledge,
proceed in time to canker the root.
</p>

<p>I was born in the house of discord.  My parents
were of unsuitable ages, contrary tempers, and different
religions, and therefore employed the spirit
and acuteness which nature had very liberally bestowed
upon both, in hourly disputes, and incessant
contrivances to detect each other in the wrong; so
that from the first exertions of reason I was bred a
disputant, trained up in all the arts of domestick
sophistry, initiated in a thousand low stratagems,

<pb n="248"/>

nimble shifts, and sly concealments; versed in all
the turns of altercation, and acquainted with the
whole discipline of <hi rend="italic">fending</hi> and <hi
rend="italic">proving</hi>.
</p>

<p>It was necessarily my care to preserve the kindness
of both the controvertists, and therefore I had
very early formed the habit of suspending my judgment,
of hearing arguments with indifference, inclining
as occasion required to either side, and of
holding myself undetermined between them till
I knew for what opinion I might conveniently
declare.
</p>

<p>Thus, Sir, I acquired very early the skill of
disputation; and, as we naturally love the arts in
which we believe ourselves to excel, I did not let
my abilities lie useless, nor suffer my dexterity to
be lost for want of practice.  I engaged in perpetual
wrangles with my school-fellows, and was never to
be convinced or repressed by any other arguments
than blows, by which my antagonists commonly
determined the controversy, as I was, like the
Roman orator, much more eminent for eloquence
than courage.
</p>

<p>At the university I found my predominant ambition
completely gratified by the study of logick.
I impressed upon my memory a thousand axioms,
and ten thousand distinctions, practised every form
of syllogism, passed all my days in the schools of
disputation, and slept every night with Smiglecius<ref
target="JohRamb.10">[a]</ref>
on my pillow.


<note id="JohRamb.10"><seg type="note-symbol">[a]</seg> <p>A Polish writer, whose "Logick" was formerly held in great estimation
in this country, as well as on the continent.</p></note>
</p>


<pb n="249"/>


<p>You will not doubt but such a genius was soon
raised to eminence by such application.  I was celebrated
in my third year for the most artful opponent
that the university could boast, and became
the terrour and envy of all the candidates for
philosophical reputation.
</p>

<p>My renown, indeed, was not purchased but at
the price of all my time and all my studies.  I never
spoke but to contradict, nor declaimed but in defence
of a position universally acknowledged to be
false, and therefore worthy, in my opinion, to be
adorned with all the colours of false representation,
and strengthened with all the art of fallacious
subtilty.
</p>

<p>My father, who had no other wish than to see
his son richer than himself, easily concluded that I
should distinguish myself among the professors of
the law; and therefore, when I had taken my first
degree, dispatched me to the Temple with a paternal
admonition, that I should never suffer myself
to feel shame, for nothing but modesty could retard
my fortune.
</p>

<p>Vitiated, ignorant, and heady as I was, I had not
yet lost my reverence for virtue, and therefore could
not receive such dictates without horrour; but, however,
was pleased with his determination of my
course of life, because he placed me in the way that
leads soonest from the prescribed walks of discipline
and education, to the open fields of liberty and
choice.
</p>

<p>I was now in the place where every one catches

<pb n="250"/>

the contagion of vanity, and soon began to distinguish
myself by sophisms and paradoxes.  I declared
war against all received opinions and established
rules, and levelled my batteries particularly against
those universal principles which had stood unshaken
in all the vicissitudes of literature, and are considered
as the inviolable temples of truth, or the impregnable
bulwarks of science.
</p>

<p>I applied myself chiefly to those parts of learning
which have filled the world with doubt and perplexity,
and could readily produce all the arguments
relating to matter and motion, time and space,
identity and infinity.
</p>

<p>I was equally able and equally willing to maintain
the system of Newton or Descartes, and
favoured occasionally the hypothesis of Ptolemy,
or that of Copernicus.  I sometimes exalted vegetables
to sense, and sometimes degraded animals to
mechanism.
</p>

<p>Nor was I less inclined to weaken the credit of
history, or perplex the doctrines of polity.  I was
always of the party which I heard the company
condemn.
</p>

<p>Among the zealots of liberty I could harangue
with great copiousness upon the advantages of absolute
monarchy, the secrecy of its counsels, and the
expedition of its measures; and often celebrated the
blessings produced by the extinction of parties, and
preclusion of debates.
</p>

<p>Among the assertors of regal authority, I never
failed to declaim with republican warmth upon the

<pb n="251"/>

original charter of universal liberty, the corruption
of courts, and the folly of voluntary submission to
those whom nature has levelled with ourselves.
</p>

<p>I knew the defects of every scheme of government,
and the inconveniences of every law.  I sometimes
shewed how much the condition of mankind
would be improved, by breaking the world into
petty sovereignties, and sometimes displayed the
felicity and peace which universal monarchy would
diffuse over the earth.
</p>

<p>To every acknowledged fact I found innumerable
objections; for it was my rule, to judge of history
only by abstracted probability, and therefore I made
no scruple of bidding defiance to testimony.  I have
more than once questioned the existence of Alexander
the Great; and having demonstrated the folly
of erecting edifices like the pyramids of Egypt, I
frequently hinted my suspicion that the world had
been long deceived, and that they were to be found
only in the narratives of travellers.
</p>

<p>It had been happy for me could I have confined
my scepticism to historical controversies and philosophical
disquisitions; but having now violated my
reason, and accustomed myself to inquire not after
proofs, but objections, I had perplexed truth with
falsehood, till my ideas were confused, my judgment
embarrassed, and my intellects distorted.  The
habit of considering every proposition as alike uncertain,
left me no test by which any tenet could be
tried; every opinion presented both sides with equal
evidence, and my fallacies began to operate upon

<pb n="252"/>

my own mind in more important inquiries.  It was
at last the sport of my vanity to weaken the obligations
of moral duty, and efface the distinctions of
good and evil, till I had deadened the sense of conviction,
and abandoned my heart to the fluctuations
of uncertainty, without anchor and without compass,
without satisfaction of curiosity, or peace of
conscience, without principles of reason, or motives
of action.
</p>

<p>Such is the hazard of repressing the first perceptions
of truth, of spreading for diversion the snares
of sophistry, and engaging reason against its own
determinations.
</p>

<p>The disproportions of absurdity grow less and less
visible, as we are reconciled by degrees to the
deformity of a mistress; and falsehood by long use,
is assimilated to the mind, as poison to the body.
</p>

<p>I had soon the mortification of seeing my conversation
courted only by the ignorant or wicked,
by either boys who were enchanted by novelty, or
wretches, who having long disobeyed virtue and
reason, were now desirous of my assistance to
dethrone them.
</p>

<p>Thus alarmed, I shuddered at my own corruption,
and that pride by which I had been seduced, contributed
to reclaim me.  I was weary of continual
irresolution, and a perpetual equipoise of the mind;
and ashamed of being the favourite of those who
were scorned and shunned by the rest of mankind.
</p>

<p>I therefore retired from all temptation to dispute,
prescribed a new regimen to my understanding,

<pb n="258"/>

and resolved, instead of rejecting all established
opinions which I could not prove, to tolerate though
not adopt all which I could not confute.  I forebore
to heat my imagination with needless controversies,
to discuss questions confessedly uncertain, and
refrained steadily from gratifying my vanity by the
support of falsehood.
</p>

<p>By this method I am at length recovered from
my argumental delirium, and find myself in the
state of one awakened from the confusion and tumult
of a feverish dream.  I rejoice in the new possession
of evidence and reality, and step on from truth to
truth with confidence and quiet.
</p>

</epigraph>

<p>IT is reported of the Persians, by an ancient writer,
that the sum of their education consisted in teaching
youth <hi rend="italic">to ride, to shoot with the bow, and to speak
truth</hi>.
</p>

<p>The bow and the horse were easily mastered, but
it would have been happy if we had been informed
by what arts veracity was cultivated, and by what
preservatives a Persian mind was secured against
the temptations to falsehood.
</p>

<p>There are, indeed, in the present corruption of

<pb n="254"/>

mankind, many incitements to forsake truth; the
need of palliating our own faults, and the convenience
of imposing on the ignorance or credulity
of others, so frequently occur, so many immediate
evils are to be avoided, and so many present gratifications
obtained, by craft and delusion, that very
few of those who are much entangled in life, have
spirit and constancy sufficient to support them in
the steady practice of open veracity.
</p>

<p>In order that all men may be taught to speak
truth, it is necessary that all likewise should learn
to hear it; for no species of falsehood is more frequent
than flattery, to which the coward is betrayed
by fear, the dependant by interest, and the friend
by tenderness.  Those who are neither servile nor
timorous, are yet desirous to bestow pleasure; and
while unjust demands of praise continue to be made,
there will always be some whom hope, fear, or kindness,
will dispose to pay them.
</p>

<p>The guilt of falsehood is very widely extended,
and many whom their conscience can scarcely charge
with stooping to a lie, have vitiated the morals of
others by their vanity, and patronized the vice they
believe themselves to abhor.
</p>

<p>Truth is, indeed, not often welcome for its own
sake; it is generally unpleasing, because contrary to
our wishes and opposite to our practice; and as our
attention naturally follows our interest, we hear
unwillingly what we are afraid to know, and soon forget
what we have no inclination to impress upon
our memories.

<pb n="255"/>

</p>

<p>For this reason many arts of instruction have
been invented, by which the reluctance against
truth may be overcome; and as physick is given to
children in confections, precepts have been hidden
under a thousand appearances, that mankind may
be bribed by pleasure to escape destruction.
</p>

<p>While the world was yet in its infancy, Truth
came among mortals from above, and Falsehood
from below.  Truth was the daughter of Jupiter and
Wisdom; Falsehood was the progeny of Folly impregnated
by the Wind.  They advanced with equal
confidence to seize the dominion of the new creation,
and, as their enmity and their force were well
known to the celestials, all the eyes of heaven were
turned upon the contest.
</p>

<p>Truth seemed conscious of superior power and
juster claim, and therefore came on towering and
majestick, unassisted and alone; Reason, indeed,
always attended her, but appeared her follower,
rather than companion.  Her march was slow and
stately, but her motion was perpetually progressive,
and when once she had grounded her foot, neither
gods nor men could force her to retire.
</p>

<p>Falsehood always endeavoured to copy the mien
and attitudes of Truth, and was very successful in
the arts of mimickry.  She was surrounded, animated,
and supported by innumerable legions of
appetites and passions, but like other feeble commanders,
was obliged often to receive law from her
allies.  Her motions were sudden, irregular, and
violent; for she had no steadiness nor constancy.

<pb n="256"/>

She often gained conquests by hasty incursions,
which she never hoped to keep by her own strength,
but maintained by the help of the passions, whom
she generally found resolute and faithful.
</p>

<p>It sometimes happened that the antagonists met
in full opposition.  In these encounters, Falsehood
always invested her head with clouds, and commanded
Fraud to place ambushes about her.  In
her left hand she bore the shield of Impudence,
and the quiver of Sophistry rattled on her shoulder.
All the passions attended at her call; Vanity
clapped her wings before, and Obstinacy supported
her behind.  Thus guarded and assisted, she sometimes
advanced against Truth, and sometimes waited
the attack; but always endeavoured to skirmish at
a distance, perpetually shifted her ground, and let
fly her arrows in different directions; for she certainly
found that her strength failed, whenever the
eye of Truth darted full upon her.
</p>

<p>Truth had the awful aspect though not the
thunder of her father, and when the long continuance
of the contest brought them near to one another,
Falsehood let the arms of Sophistry fall from
her grasp, and holding up the shield of Impudence
with both her hands, sheltered herself amongst the
Passions.
</p>

<p>Truth, though she was often wounded, always
recovered in a short time; but it was common for
the slightest hurt, received by Falsehood, to spread
its malignity to the neighbouring parts, and to burst
open again when it seemed to have been cured.

<pb n="257"/>

</p>

<p>Falsehood, in a short time, found by experience
that her superiority consisted only in the celerity
of her course, and the changes of her posture.  She
therefore ordered Suspicion to beat the ground before
her, and avoid with great care to cross the way
of Truth, who, as she never varied her point, but
moved constantly upon the same line, was easily
escaped by the oblique and desultory movements,
the quick retreats, and active doubles which Falsehood
always practised, when the enemy began to
raise terrour by her approach.
</p>

<p>By this procedure Falsehood every hour encroached
upon the world, and extended her empire
through all climes and regions.  Wherever she carried
her victories she left the Passions in full authority
behind her; who were so well pleased with
command, that they held out with great obstinacy
when Truth came to seize their posts, and never
failed to retard her progress, though they could
not always stop it.  They yielded at last with great
reluctance, frequent rallies, and sullen submission;
and always inclined to revolt when Truth ceased to
awe them by her immediate presence.
</p>

<p>Truth, who, when she first descended from the
heavenly palaces, expected to have been received
by universal acclamation, cherished with kindness,
heard with obedience, and invited to spread her
influence from province to province, now found,
that wherever she came, she must force her passage.
Every intellect was precluded by Prejudice,
and every heart pre-occupied by Passion.  She in-
<pb n="258"/>

deed advanced, but she advanced slowly; and often
lost the conquests which she left behind her, by
sudden insurrections of the appetites, that shook
of their allegiance, and ranged themselves again
under the banner of her enemy.
</p>

<p>Truth, however, did not grow weaker by the
struggle, for her vigour was unconquerable; yet she
was provoked to see herself thus baffled and
impeded by an enemy, whom she looked on with
contempt, and who had no advantage but such as
she owed to inconstancy, weakness, and artifice.
She therefore, in the anger of disappointment, called
upon her father Jupiter to re-establish her in the
skies, and leave mankind to the disorder and misery
which they deserved, by submitting willingly to
the usurpation of Falsehood.
</p>

<p>Jupiter compassionated the world too much to
grant her request, yet was willing to ease her labours
and mitigate her vexation.  He commanded
her to consult the Muses by what methods she
might obtain an easier reception, and reign without
the toil of incessant war.  It was then discovered,
that she obstructed her own progress by the severity
of her aspect, and the solemnity of her dictates; and
that men would never willingly admit her till they
ceased to fear her, since by giving themselves up to
Falsehood, they seldom make any sacrifice of their
ease or pleasure, because she took the shape that
was most engaging, and always suffered herself to
be dressed and painted by Desire.  The Muses wove,
in the loom of Pallas, a loose and changeable robe,

<pb n="259"/>

like that in which Falsehood captivated her admirers;
with this they invested Truth, and named
her Fiction.  She now went out again to conquer
with more success; for when she demanded entrance
of the Passions, they often mistook her for Falsehood,
and delivered up their charge: but when she
had once taken possession, she was soon disturbed
by Reason, and shone out, in her original form,
with native effulgence and resistless dignity.

<p>
THE reader is indebted for this day's entertainment
to an author from whom the age has
received greater favours, who has enlarged the
knowledge of human nature, and taught the passions
to move at the command of virtue.
</p>

<p><q>TO THE RAMBLER.<lb/>SIR,</q></p>

<p>WHEN the Spectator was first published in single
papers, it gave me so much pleasure, that it is
one of the favourite amusements of my age to recollect

<pb n="260"/>

it; and when I reflect on the foibles of those
times, as described in that useful work, and compare
them with the vices now reigning among
us, I cannot but wish that you would oftener take
cognizance of the manners of the better half of the
human species, that if your precepts and observations
be carried down to posterity, the Spectators
may shew to the rising generation what were the
fashionable follies of their grandmothers, the Rambler
of their mothers, and that from both they may
draw instruction and warning.
</p>

<p>When I read those Spectators which took notice
of the misbehaviour of young women at church, by
which they vainly hope to attract admirers, I used
to pronounce such forward young women Seekers,
in order to distinguish them by a mark of infamy
from those who had patience and decency to stay
till they were sought.
</p>

<p>But I have lived to see such a change in the manners
of women, that I would now be willing to
compound with them for that name, although I
then thought it disgraceful enough, if they would
deserve no worse; since now they are too generally
given up to negligence of domestick business, to
idle amusements, and to wicked rackets, without
any settled view at all but of squandering time.
</p>

<p>In the time of the Spectator, excepting sometimes
in appearance in the ring, sometimes at a
good and chosen play, sometimes on a visit at the
house of a grave relation, the young ladies contented
themselves to be found employed in do-
<pb n="261"/>

mestick duties; for then routes, drums, balls,
assemblies, and such like markets for women, were
not known.
</p>

<p>Modesty and diffidence, gentleness and meekness,
were looked upon as the appropriate virtues
and characteristick graces of the sex; and if a forward
spirit pushed itself into notice, it was exposed
in print as it deserved.
</p>

<p>The churches were almost the only places where
single women were to be seen by strangers.  Men
went thither expecting to see them, and perhaps
too much for that only purpose.
</p>

<p>But some good often resulted, however improper
might be their motives.  Both sexes were in the way
of their duty.  The man must be abandoned indeed,
who loves not goodness in another; nor were the
young fellows of that age so wholly lost to a sense
of right, as pride and conceit has since made them
affect to be.  When therefore they saw a fair-one
whose decent behaviour and cheerful piety shewed
her earnest in her first duties, they had the less
doubt, judging politically only, that she would have
conscientious regard to her second.
</p>

<p>With what ardour have I seen watched for, the
rising of a kneeling beauty; and what additional
charms has devotion given to her recommunicated
features?
</p>

<p>The men were often the better for what they
heard.  Even a Saul was once found prophesying
among the prophets whom he had set out to destroy.
To a man thus put into good humour by a

<pb n="262"/>

pleasing object, religion itself looked more amiable.
The Men Seekers of the Spectator's time loved the
holy place for the object's sake, and loved the
object for her suitable behaviour in it.
</p>

<p>Reverence mingled with their love, and they
thought that a young lady of such good principles
must be addressed only by the man who at least
made a shew of good principles, whether his heart
was yet quite right or not.
</p>

<p>Nor did the young lady's behaviour, at any time
of the service, lessen this reverence.  Her eyes were
her own, her ears the preacher's.  Women are always
most observed when they seem themselves least to
observe, or to lay out for observation.  The eye of a
respectful lover loves rather to receive confidence
from the withdrawn eye of the fair-one, than to
find itself obliged to retreat.
</p>

<p>When a young gentleman's adection was thus
laudably engaged, he pursued its natural dictates;
keeping then was a rare, at least a secret and
scandalous vice, and a wife was the summit of his
wishes.  Rejection was now dreaded, and pre-engagement apprehended.  A woman whom he loved,
he was ready to think must be admired by all the
world.  His fears, his uncertainties, increased his
love.
</p>

<p>Every inquiry he made into the lady's domestick
excellence, which, when a wife is to be chosen, will
surely not be neglected, confirmed him in his
choice.  He opens his heart to a common friend, and
honestly discovers the state of his fortune.  His

<pb n="268"/>

friend applies to those of the young lady, whose
parents, if they approve his proposals, disclose them
to their daughter.
</p>

<p>She perhaps is not an absolute stranger to the
passion of the young gentleman.  His eyes, his
assiduities, his constant attendance at a church,
whither, till of late, he used seldom to come, and a
thousand little observances that he paid her, had
very probably first forced her to regard, and then
inclined her to favour him.
</p>

<p>That a young lady should be in love, and the
love of the young gentleman undeclared, is an
heterodoxy which prudence, and even policy, must
not allow.  But, thus applied to, she is all resignation
to her parents.  Charming resignation, which inclination
opposes not.
</p>

<p>Her relations applaud her for her duty; friends
meet; points are adjusted; delightful perturbations,
and hopes, and a few lover's fears, fill up the tedious
space till an interview is granted; for the young lady
had not made herself cheap at publick places.
</p>

<p>The time of interview arrives.  She is modestly
reserved; he is not confident.  He declares his passion;
the consciousness of her own worth, and his
application to her parents, take from her any doubt
of his sincerity; and she owns herself obliged to him
for his good opinion.  The inquiries of her friends
into his character, have taught her that his good
opinion deserves to be valued.
</p>

<p>She tacitly allows of his future visits; he renews
them; the regard of each for the other is confirmed;

<pb n="264"/>

and when he presses for the favour of her hand, he
receives a declaration of an entire acquiescence with
her duty, and a modest acknowledgment of esteem
for him.
</p>

<p>He applies to her parents therefore for a near day;
and thinks himself under obligation to them for the
cheerful and affectionate manner with which they
receive his agreeable application.
</p>

<p>With this prospect of future happiness, the marriage
is celebrated.  Gratulations pour in from every
quarter.  Parents and relations on both sides, brought
acquainted in the course of the courtship, can receive
the happy couple with countenances illumined,
and joyful hearts.
</p>

<p>The brothers, the sisters, the friends of one family,
are the brothers, the sisters, the friends of the other.
Their two families, thus made one, are the world
to the young couple.
</p>

<p>Their home is the place of their principal delight,
nor do they ever occasionally quit it but they find
the pleasure of returning to it augmented in proportion
to the time of their absence from it.
</p>

<p>Oh, Mr. Rambler! forgive the talkativeness of an
old man! When I courted and married my L&aelig;titia,
then a blooming beauty, every thing passed just so!
But how is the case now? The ladies, maidens,
wives, and widows, are engrossed by places of open
resort and general entertainment, which fill every
quarter of the metropolis, and being constantly
frequented, make home irksome.  Breakfasting-places,
dining places, routes, drums, concerts, balls, plays,

<pb n="265"/>

operas, masquerades for the evening, and even for
all night, and lately, publick sales of the goods of
broken housekeepers, which the general dissoluteness
of manners has contributed to make very frequent,
come in as another seasonable relief to these
modern time-killers.
</p>

<p>In the summer there are in every country-town
assemblies; Tunbridge, Bath, Cheltenham, Scarborough!
What expense of dress and equipage is
required to qualify the frequenters for such emulous
appearance!
</p>

<p>By the natural infection of example, the lowest
people have places of six-penny resort, and gaming-tables for pence.  Thus servants are now induced to
fraud and dishonesty, to support extravagance, and
supply their losses.
</p>

<p>As to the ladies who frequent those publick places,
they are not ashamed to shew their faces wherever
men dare go, nor blush to try who shall stare most
impudently, or who shall laugh loudest on the
publick walks.
</p>

<p>The men who would make good husbands, if
they visit those places, are frighted at wedlock, and
resolve to live single, except they are bought at a
very high price.  They can be spectators of all that
passes, and, if they please, more than spectators, at
the expense of others.  The companion of an evening
and the companion for life, require very different
qualifications.
</p>

<p>Two thousand pounds in the last age, with a
domestick wife, would go farther than ten thousand

<pb n="266"/>

in this.  Yet settlements are expected, that often,
to a mercantile man especially, sink a fortune into
uselessness; and pin-money is stipulated for, which
makes a wife independent, and destroys love, by
putting it out of a man's power to lay any obligation
upon her, that might engage gratitude, and
kindle affection.  When to all this the card-tables
are added, how can a prudent man think of marrying?
</p>

<p>And when the worthy men know not where to
find wives, must not the sex be left to the foplings,
the coxcombs, the libertines of the age, whom they
help to make such? And need even these wretches
marry to enjoy the conversation of those who render
their company so cheap?
</p>

<p>And what, after all, is the benefit which the gay
coquette obtains by her flutters? As she is approachable
by every man without requiring, I will not say
incense or adoration, but even common complaisance,
every fop treats her as upon the level, looks
upon her light airs as invitations, and is on the
watch to take the advantage: she has companions
indeed, but no lovers; for love is respectful and
timorous; and where among all her followers will
she find a husband?
</p>

<p>Set, dear Sir, before the youthful, the gay, the
inconsiderate, the contempt as well as the danger to
which they are exposed.  At one time or other,
women not utterly thoughtless, will be convinced
of the justice of your censure, and the charity of
your instruction.
</p>

<p>But should your expostulations and reproofs have

<pb n="267"/>

no effect upon those who are far gone in fashionable
folly, they may be retailed from their mouths to
their nieces, (marriage will not often have entitled
these to daughters,) when they, the meteors of a
day, find themselves elbowed off the stage of vanity
by other flutterers; for the most admired women
cannot have many Tunbridge, many Bath seasons
to blaze in; since even fine faces, often seen, are less
regarded than new faces, the proper punishment
of showy girls for rendering themselves so impolitickly
cheap.

<opener>

TO THE AUTHOR OF THE RAMBLER.<lb/>
<salute>MR. RAMBLER,
</salute>

</opener>

<p>You have often endeavoured to impress upon
your readers an observation of more truth than
novelty, that life passes, for the most part, in petty
transactions; that our hours glide away in trifling
amusements and slight gratifications; and that there
very seldom emerges any occasion that can call
forth great virtue or great abilities.
</p>

<p>It very commonly happens that speculation has

<pb n="268"/>

no influence on conduct.  Just conclusions, and cogent
arguments, formed by laborious study, and
diligent inquiry, are often reposited in the treasuries
of memory, as gold in a miser's chest, useless
alike to others and himself.  As some are not richer
for the extent of their possessions, others are not
wiser for the multitude of their ideas.
</p>

<p>You have truly described the state of human
beings, but it may be doubted whether you have
accommodated your precepts to your description;
whether you have not generally considered your
readers as influenced by the tragick passions, and
susceptible of pain or pleasure only from powerful
agents, and from great events.
</p>

<p>To an author who writes not for the improvement
of a single art, or the establishment of a controverted
doctrine, but equally intends the advantage
and equally courts the perusal of all the classes of
mankind, nothing can justly seem unworthy of regard,
by which the pleasure of conversation may be
increased, and the daily satisfactions of familiar life
secured from interruption and disgust.
</p>

<p>For this reason you would not have injured your
reputation, if you had sometimes descended to the
minuter duties of social beings, and enforced the
observance of those little civilities and ceremonious
delicacies, which, inconsiderable as they may appear
to the man of science, and difficult as they may
prove to be detailed with dignity, yet contribute to
the regulation of the world, by facilitating the
intercourse between one man and another, and of

<pb n="269"/>

which the French have sufficiently testified their
esteem, by terming the knowledge and practice of
them <foreign lang="lat" ><hi rend="italic">S&ccedil;avoir vivre</hi></foreign>, The art of living.
</p>

<p>Politeness is one of those advantages which we
never estimate rightly but by the inconvenience of
its loss.  Its influence upon the manners is constant
and uniform, so that, like an equal motion, it escapes
perception.  The circumstances of every action
are so adjusted to each other, that we do not see
where any errour could have been committed, and
rather acquiesce in its propriety than admire its
exactness.
</p>

<p>But as sickness shews us the value of ease, a little
familiarity with those who were never taught to
endeavour the gratification of others, but regulate
their behaviour merely by their own will, will soon
evince the necessity of established modes and
formalities to the happiness and quiet of common
life.
</p>

<p>Wisdom and virtue are by no means sufficient,
without the supplemental laws of good-breeding,
to secure freedom from degenerating to rudeness,
or self-esteem from swelling into insolence; a thousand
incivilities may be committed, and a thousand
offices neglected, without any remorse of conscience
or reproach from reason.
</p>

<p>The true effect of genuine politeness seems to be
rather ease than pleasure.  The power of delighting
must be conferred by nature, and cannot be delivered
by precept, or obtained by imitation; but
though it be the privilege of a very small number

<pb n="270"/>

to ravish and to charm, every man may hope by
rules and caution not to give pain, and may, therefore,
by the help of good-breeding, enjoy the kindness
of mankind, though he should have no claim
to higher distinctions.
</p>

<p>The universal axiom in which all complaisance is
included, and from which flow all the formalities
which custom has established in civilized nations,
is, <hi rend="italic">That no man shall give any preference to
himself</hi>.
A rule so comprehensive and certain, that, perhaps,
it is not easy for the mind to image an incivility,
without supposing it to be broken.
</p>

<p>There are, indeed, in every place some particular
modes of the ceremonial part of good-breeding,
which, being arbitrary and accidental, can be learned
only by habitude and conversation; such are the
forms of salutation, the different gradations of
reverence, and all the adjustments of place and
precedence.  These, however, may be often violated
without offence, if it be sufficiently evident, that
neither malice nor pride contributed to the failure;
but will not atone, however rigidly observed, for
the tumour of insolence, or petulance of contempt.
</p>

<p>I have, indeed, not found among any part of
mankind, less real and rational complaisance, than
among those who have passed their time in paying
and receiving visits, in frequenting publick
entertainments, in studying the exact measures of
ceremony, and in watching all the variations of
fashionable courtesy.
</p>

<p>They know, indeed, at what hour they may beat

<pb n="271"/>

the door of an acquaintance, how many steps they
must attend him towards the gate, and what interval
should pass before his visit is returned; but seldom
extend their care beyond the exterior and
unessential parts of civility, nor refuse their own
vanity any gratification, however expensive to the
quiet of another.
</p>

<p>Trypherus is a man remarkable for splendour and
expense; a man, that having been originally placed
by his fortune and rank in the first class of the
community, has acquired that air of dignity, and that
readiness in the exchange of compliments, which
courts, balls, and levees, easily confer.
</p>

<p>But Trypherus, without any settled purposes of
malignity, partly by his ignorance of human nature,
and partly by the habit of contemplating with great
satisfaction his own grandeur and riches, is hourly
giving disgust to those whom chance or expectation
subjects to his vanity.
</p>

<p>To a man whose fortune confines him to a small
house, he declaims upon the pleasure of spacious
apartments, and the convenience of changing his
lodging-room in different parts of the year; tells
him, that he hates confinement; and concludes, that
if his chamber was less, he should never wake without
thinking of a prison.
</p>

<p>To Eucretas, a man of birth equal to himself, but
of much less estate, he shewed his services of plate,
and remarked that such things were, indeed, nothing
better than costly trifles, but that no man must
pretend to the rank of a gentleman without them;

<pb n="272"/>

and that for his part, if his estate was smaller, he
should not think of enjoying but increasing it, and
would inquire out a trade for his eldest son.
</p>

<p>He has, in imitation of some more acute observer
than himself, collected a great many shifts, and
artifices by which poverty is concealed; and among the
ladies of small fortune, never fails to talk of frippery
and slight silks, and the convenience of a general
mourning.
</p>

<p>I have been insulted a thousand times with a catalogue
of his pictures, his jewels, and his rarities,
which, though he knows the humble neatness of my
habitation, he seldom fails to conclude by a declaration,
that wherever he sees a house meanly furnished,
he despises the owner's taste, or pities his poverty.
</p>

<p>This, Mr. Rambler, is the practice of Trypherus,
by which he is become the terrour of all who are
less wealthy than himself, and has raised innumerable
enemies without rivalry, and without malevolence.
</p>

<p>Yet though all are not equally culpable with
Trypherus, it is scarcely possible to find any man
who does not frequently, like him, indulge his own
pride by forcing others into a comparison with himself
when he knows the advantage is on his side,
without considering that unnecessarily to obtrude
unpleasing ideas, is a species of oppression; and that
it is little more criminal to deprive another of some
real advantage, than to interrupt that forgetfulness
of its absence which is the next happiness to actual
possesslon.

</epigraph>

<p>IT has been ordained by Providence, for the
conservation of order in the immense variety of
nature, and for the regular propagation of the several
classes of life with which the elements are peopled,
that every creature should be drawn by some secret
attraction to those of his own kind; and that not
only the gentle and domestick animals which naturally
unite into companies, or co-habit by pairs,
should continue faithful to their species; but even
those ravenous and ferocious savages which Aristotle
observes never to be gregarious, should range mountains
and deserts in search of one another, rather
than pollute the world with a monstrous birth.
</p>

<p>As the perpetuity and distinction of the lower
tribes of the creation require that they should be
determined to proper mates by some uniform motive
of choice, or some cogent principle of instinct, it is
necessary, likewise, that man, whose wider capacity
demands more gratifications, and who feels in himself
innumerable wants, which a life of solitude cannot
supply, and innumerable powers to which it
cannot give employment, should be led to suitable
companions by particular influence; and among

<pb n="274"/>

many beings of the same nature with himself, he
may select some for intimacy and tenderness, and
improve the condition of his existence, by super-adding friendship to humanity, and the love of
individuals to that of the species.
</p>

<p>Other animals are so formed, that they seem to
contribute very little to the happiness of each
other, and know neither joy, nor grief, nor love,
nor hatred, but as they are urged by some desire
immediately subservient either to the support of
their own lives, or to the continuation of their race;
they therefore seldom appear to regard any of the
minuter discriminations which distinguish creatures
of the same kind from one another.
</p>

<p>But if man were to feel no incentives to kindness,
more than his general tendency to congenial nature,
Babylon or London, with all their multitudes,
would have to him the desolation of a wilderness;
his affections, not compressed into a narrower compass,
would vanish, like elemental fire, in boundless
evaporation; he would languish in perpetual insensibility,
and though he might, perhaps, in the first
vigour of youth, amuse himself with the fresh enjoyments
of life, yet, when curiosity should cease,
and alacrity subside, he would abandon himself to
the fluctuations of chance, without expecting help
against any calamity, or feeling any wish for the
happiness of others.
</p>

<p>To love all men is our duty, so far as it includes
a general habit of benevolence, and readiness of
occasional kindness; but to love all equally is impos-
<pb n="275"/>

sible; at least impossible without the extinction of
those passions which now produce all our pains and
all our pleasures; without the disuse, if not the abolition,
of some of our faculties, and the suppression
of all our hopes and fears in apathy and indifference.
</p>

<p>The necessities of our condition require a thousand
offices of tenderness, which mere regard for the
species will never dictate.  Every man has frequent
grievances which only the solicitude of friendship
will discover and remedy, and which would remain
for ever unheeded in the mighty heap of human
calamity, were it only surveyed by the eye of general
benevolence equally attentive to every misery.
</p>

<p>The great community of mankind is, therefore,
necessarily broken into smaller independent societies;
these form distinct interests, which are too frequently
opposed to each other, and which they who
have entered into the league of particular governments
falsely think it virtue to promote, however
destructive to the happiness of the rest of the world.
</p>

<p>Such unions are again separated into subordinate
classes and combinations, and social life is perpetually
branched out into minuter subdivisions, till it
terminates in the last ramifications of private life.
</p>

<p>That friendship may at once be fond and lasting,
it has been already observed in these papers, that a
conformity of inclinations is necessary.  No man can
have much kindness for him by whom he does not
believe himself esteemed, and nothing so evidently
proves esteem as imitation.
</p>

<p>That benevolence is always strongest which arises

<pb n="276"/>

from participation of the same pleasures, since we
are naturally most willing to revive in our minds
the memory of persons, with whom the idea of
enjoyment is connected.
</p>

<p>It is commonly, therefore, to little purpose that
any one endeavours to ingratiate himself with such
as he cannot accompany in their amusements and
diversions.  Men have been known to rise to favour
and to fortune, only by being skilful in the sports
with which their patron happened to be delighted,
by concurring with his taste for some particular
species of curiosities, by relishing the same wine, or
applauding the same cookery.
</p>

<p>Even those whom wisdom or virtue have placed
above regard to such petty recommendations, must
nevertheless be gained by similitude of manners.
The highest and noblest enjoyment of familiar life,
the communication of knowledge, and reciprocation
of sentiments, must always pre-suppose a disposition
to the same inquiry, and delight in the
same discoveries.
</p>

<p>With what satisfaction could the politician lay
his schemes for the reformation of laws, or his
comparisons of different forms of government, before
the chemist, who has never accustomed his thoughts
to any other object than salt and sulphur? or how
could the astronomer, in explaining his calculations
and conjectures, endure the coldness of a grammarian,
who would lose sight of Jupiter and all his
satellites, for a happy etymology of an obscure
word, or a better explication of a controverted line?

<pb n="277"/>

</p>

<p>Every man loves merit of the same kind with
his own, when it is not likely to hinder his advancement
or his reputation; for he not only best understands
the worth of those qualities which he labours
to cultivate, or the usefulness of the art which he
practises with success, but always feels a reflected
pleasure from the praises, which, though given to
another, belong equally to himself.
</p>

<p>There is, indeed, no need of research and refinement
to discover that men must generally select
their companions from their own state of life, since
there are not many minds furnished for great variety
of conversation, or adapted to multiplicity of intellectual
entertainments.
</p>

<p>The sailor, the academick, the lawyer, the mechanick,
and the courtier, have all a cast of talk peculiar
to their own fraternity; have fixed their attention
upon the same events, have been engaged in affairs
of the same sort, and made use of allusions and
illustrations which themselves only can understand.
</p>

<p>To be infected with the jargon of a particular
profession, and to know only the language of a
single rank of mortals, is indeed sufficiently despicable.
But as limits must be always set to the excursions
of the human mind, there will be some study
which every man more zealously prosecutes, some
darling subject on which he is principally pleased
to converse; and he that can most inform or best
understand him, will certainly be welcomed with
particular regard.
</p>

<p>Such partiality is not wholly to be avoided, nor

<pb n="278"/>

is it culpable, unless suffered so far to predominate
as to produce aversion from every other kind of
excellence, and to shade the lustre of dissimilar
virtues.  Those, therefore, whom the lot of life has
conjoined, should endeavour constantly to approach
towards the inclination of each other, invigorate
every motion of concurrent desire, and fan every
spark of kindred curiosity.
</p>

<p>It has been justly observed, that discord generally
operates in little things; it is inflamed to its utmost
vehemence by contrariety of taste, oftener than of
principles; and might therefore commonly be
avoided by innocent conformity, which, if it was not
at first the motive, ought always to be the consequence
of indissoluble union.

TO THE RAMBLER.<lb/>
<salute>SIR,
</salute>

</opener>

<p>As very many well-disposed persons, by the
unavoidable necessity of their affairs, are so unfortunate
as to be totally buried in the country, where
they labour under the most deplorable ignorance of
what is transacting among the polite part of mankind,
I cannot help thinking, that, as a publick

<pb n="279"/>

writer, you should take the case of these truly
compassionable objects under your consideration.
</p>

<p>These unhappy languishers in obscurity should
be furnished with such accounts of the employments
of people of the world, as may engage them
in their several remote corners to a laudable imitation;
or, at least, so far inform and prepare them,
that if by any joyful change of situation they should
be suddenly transported into the gay scene, they
may not gape, and wonder, and stare, and be utterly
at a loss how to behave and make a proper appearance
in it.
</p>

<p>It is inconceivable how much the welfare of all
the country towns in the kingdom might be promoted,
if you would use your charitable endeavours
to raise in them a noble emulation of the manners
and customs of higher life.
</p>

<p>For this purpose you should give a very clear and
ample description of the whole set of polite acquirements;
a complete history of forms, fashions, frolicks;
of routs, drums, hurricanes, balls, assemblies,
ridottos, masquerades, auctions, plays, operas, puppet-shows, and bear-gardens; of all those delights
which profitably engage the attention of the most
sublime characters, and by which they have brought
to such amazing perfection the whole art and mystery
of passing day after day, week after week, and
year after year, without the heavy assistance of any
one thing that formal creatures are pleased to call
useful and necessary.
</p>

<p>In giving due instructions through what steps to

<pb n="280"/>

attain this summit of human excellence, you may
add such irrestible arguments in its favour, as must
convince numbers, who in other instances do not
seem to want natural understanding, of the unaccountable
errour of supposing they were sent into
the world for any other purpose but to flutter, sport,
and shine.  For, after all, nothing can be clearer than
that an everlasting round of diversion, and the more
lively and hurrying the better, is the most important
end of human life.
</p>

<p>It is really prodigious, so much as the world is
improved, that there should in these days be persons
so ignorant and stupid as to think it necessary to
misspend their time, and trouble their heads about
any thing else than pursuing the present fancy; for
what else is worth living for?
</p>

<p>It is time enough surely to think of consequences
when they come; and as for the antiquated notions
of duty, they are not to be met with in any French
novel, or any book one ever looks into, but derived
almost wholly from the writings of authors<ref
target="JohRamb.12">[c]</ref>, who
lived a vast many ages ago, and who, as they were
totally without any idea of those accomplishments
which now characterize people of distinction, have
been for some time sinking apace into utter contempt.
It does not appear that even their most
zealous admirers, for some partisans of his own sort

<pb n="281"/>

every writer will have, can pretend to say they were
ever at one ridotto.


<note id="JohRamb.12"><seg type="note-symbol">[c]</seg> <p>In the original of this paper, written by Mrs. Carter, and republished
by her nephew and executor, the Rev. Montagu Pennington, (Memoirs
of Mrs. C.  Vol. ii. Oct. 1816,) the following words occur, which were
unaccountably omitted by Dr. Johnson&mdash;"authors called, I think Peter
and Paul, who lived." &amp;c.</p></note>

</p>

<p>In the important article of diversions, the ceremonial
of visits, the ecstatick delight of unfriendly
intimacies and unmeaning civilities, they are absolutely
silent.  Blunt truth, and downright honesty,
plain clothes, staying at home, hard work, few
words, and those unenlivened with censure or double
meaning, are what they recommend as the ornaments
and pleasures of life.  Little oaths, polite dissimulation,
tea-table scandal, delightful indolence,
the glitter of finery, the triumph of precedence, the
enchantments of flattery, they seem to have had no
notion of; and I cannot but laugh to think what a
figure they would have made in a drawing-room,
and how frighted they would have looked at a
gaming-table.
</p>

<p>The noble zeal of patriotism that disdains authority,
and tramples on laws for sport, was absolutely
the aversion of these tame wretches.
</p>

<p>Indeed one cannot discover any one thing they
pretend to teach people, but to be wise, and good;
acquirements infinitely below the consideration of
persons of taste and spirit, who know how to spend
their time to so much better purpose.
</p>

<p>Among other admirable improvements, pray, Mr.
Rambler, do not forget to enlarge on the very extensive
benefit of playing at cards on Sundays, a
practice of such infinite use, that we may modestly
expect to see it prevail universally in all parts of
this kingdom.

<pb n="282"/>

</p>

<p>To persons of fashion, the advantage is obvious;
because, as for some strange reason or other, which
no fine gentleman or fine lady has yet been able to
penetrate, there is neither play, nor masquerade,
nor bottled conjurer, nor any other thing worth
living for, to be had on a Sunday; if it were not
for the charitable assistance of whist or bragg, the
genteel part of mankind must, one day in seven,
necessarily suffer a total extinction of being.
</p>

<p>Nor are the persons of high rank the only gainers
by so salutary a custom, which extends its good
influence, in some degree, to the lower orders of
people; but were it quite general, how much better
and happier would the world be than it is even now?
</p>

<p>'Tis hard upon poor creatures, be they ever so
mean, to deny them those enjoyments and liberties
which are equally open for all.  Yet if servants were
taught to go to church on this day, spend some part
of it in reading or receiving instruction in a family
way, and the rest in mere friendly conversation, the
poor wretches would infallibly take it into their
heads, that they were obliged to be sober, modest,
diligent, and faithful to their masters and mistresses.
</p>

<p>Now surely no one of common prudence or
humanity would wish their domesticks infected
with such strange and primitive notions, or laid
under such unmerciful restraints: all which may, in
a great measure, be prevented by the prevalence of
the good-humoured fashion, that I would have you
recommend.  For when the lower kind of people see
their betters, with a truly laudable spirit, insulting

<pb n="283"/>

and flying in the face of those rude, ill-bred dictators,
piety and the laws, they are thereby excited
and admonished, as far as actions can admonish and
excite, and taught that they too have an equal right
of setting them at defiance in such instances as their
particular necessities and inclinations may require;
and thus is the liberty of the whole human species
mightily improved and enlarged.
</p>

<p>In short, Mr. Rambler, by a faithful representation
of the numberless benefits of a modish life, you
will have done your part in promoting what every
body seems to confess the true purpose of human
existence, perpetual dissipation.
</p>

<p>By encouraging people to employ their whole
attention on trifles, and make amusement their sole
study, you will teach them how to avoid many very
uneasy reflections.
</p>

<p>All the soft feelings of humanity, the sympathies
of friendship, all natural temptations to the care of
a family, and solicitude about the good or ill of
others, with the whole train of domestick and social
affections, which create such daily anxieties and
embarrassments, will be happily stifled and suppressed
in a round of perpetual delights; and all
serious thoughts, but particularly that of <hi
rend="italic">hereafter</hi>,
be banished out of the world; a most perplexing
apprehension, but luckily a most groundless one
too, as it is so very clear a case, that nobody ever
dies.

<p><q>TO THE RAMBLER.<lb/>SIR,</q></p>


<p>HAVING by several years of continual study
treasured in my mind a great number of principles
and ideas, and obtained by frequent exercise
the power of applying them with propriety, and
combining them with readiness, I resolved to quit
the university, where I considered myself as a gem
hidden in the mine, and to mingle in the crowd of
publick life.  I was naturally attracted by the company
of those who were of the same age with myself,
and finding that my academical gravity contributed
very little to my reputation, applied my faculties
to jocularity and burlesque.  Thus, in a short time,
I had heated my imagination to such a state of activity
and ebullition, that upon every occasion it
fumed away in bursts of wit, and evaporations of
gaiety.  I became on a sudden the idol of the coffee-house, was in one winter solicited to accept the
presidentship of five clubs, was dragged by violence
to every new play, and quoted in every controversy
upon theatrical merit; was in every publick place
surrounded by a multitude of humble auditors,
who retailed in other places of resort my maxims

<pb n="285"/>

and my jests, and was boasted as their intimate and
companion, by many, who had no other pretensions
to my acquaintance, than that they had drank
chocolate in the same room.
</p>

<p>You will not wonder, Mr. Rambler, that I mention
my success with some appearance of triumph
and elevation.  Perhaps no kind of superiority is
more flattering or alluring than that which is
conferred by the powers of conversation, by extemporaneous
sprightliness of fancy, copiousness of language,
and fertility of sentiment.  In other exertions
of genius, the greater part of the praise is unknown
and unenjoyed; the writer, indeed, spreads his reputation
to a wider extent, but receives little pleasure
or advantage from the diffusion of his name, and
only obtains a kind of nominal sovereignty over
regions which pay no tribute.  The colloquial wit
has always his own radiance reflected on himself,
and enjoys all the pleasure which he bestows; he
finds his power confessed by every one that approaches
him, sees friendship kindling with rapture,
and attention swelling into praise.
</p>

<p>The desire which every man feels of importance
and esteem, is so much gratified by finding an assembly,
at his entrance, brightened with gladness
and hushed with expectation, that the recollection
of such distinctions can scarcely fail to be pleasing
whensoever it is innocent.  And my conscience does
not reproach me with any mean or criminal effects
of vanity; since I always employed my influence
on the side of virtue, and never sacrificed my

<pb n="286"/>

understanding or my religion to the pleasure of
applause.
</p>

<p>There were many whom either the desire of enjoying
my pleasantry, or the pride of being thought
to enjoy it, brought often into my company; but I
was caressed in a particular manner by Demochares,
a gentleman of a large estate, and a liberal disposition.
My fortune being by no means exuberant,
inclined me to be pleased with a friend who was
willing to be entertained at his own charge.  I became
by daily invitations habituated to his table,
and, as he believed my acquaintance necessary to
the character of elegance, which he was desirous of
establishing, I lived in all the luxury of affluence,
without expense or dependence, and passed my life
in a perpetual reciprocation of pleasure, with men
brought together by similitude of accomplishments,
or desire of improvement.
</p>

<p>But all power has its sphere of activity, beyond
which it produces no effect.  Demochares, being
called by his affairs into the country, imagined that
he should increase his popularity by coming among
his neighbours accompanied by a man whose abilities
were so generally allowed.  The report presently
spread through half the country that Demochares
was arrived, and had brought with him the celebrated
Hilarius, by whom such merriment would
be excited, as had never been enjoyed or conceived
before.  I knew, indeed, the purpose for which I was
invited, and, as men do not look diligently out for
possible miscarriages, was pleased to find myself

<pb n="287"/>

courted upon principles of interest, and considered
as capable of reconciling factions, composing feuds,
and uniting a whole province in social happiness.
</p>

<p>After a few days spent in adjusting his domestick
regulations, Demochares invited all the gentlemen
of his neighbourhood to dinner, and did not forget
to hint how much my presence was expected to
heighten the pleasure of the feast.  He informed me
what prejudices my reputation had raised in my
favour, and represented the satisfaction with which
he should see me kindle up the blaze of merriment,
and should remark the various effects that my fire
would have upon such diversity of matter.
</p>

<p>This declaration, by which he intended to quicken
my vivacity, filled me with solicitude.  I felt an
ambition of shining which I never knew before;
and was therefore embarrassed with an unusual fear
of disgrace.  I passed the night in planning out to
myself the conversation of the coming day; recollected
all my topicks of raillery, proposed proper
subjects of ridicule, prepared smart replies to a
thousand questions, accommodated answers to imaginary
repartees, and formed a magazine of
remarks, apophthegms, tales, and illustrations.
</p>

<p>The morning broke at last in the midst of these
busy meditations.  I rose with the palpitations of a
champion on the day of combat; and, notwithstanding
all my efforts, found my spirits sunk under the
weight of expectation.  The company soon after
began to drop in, and every one, at his entrance, was
introduced to Hilarius.  What conception the in-
<pb n="288"/>

habitants of this region had formed of a wit, I cannot
yet discover; but observed that they all seemed,
after the regular exchange of compliments, to turn
away disappointed; and that while we waited for
dinner, they cast their eyes first upon me, and then
upon each other, like a theatrical assembly waiting
for a show.
</p>

<p>From the uneasiness of this situation, I was relieved
by the dinner; and as every attention was
taken up by the business of the hour, I sunk quietly
to a level with the rest of the company.  But no
sooner were the dishes removed, than, instead of
cheerful confidence and familiar prattle, an universal
silence again shewed their expectation of some unusual
performance.  My friend endeavoured to rouse
them by healths and questions, but they answered
him with great brevity, and immediately relapsed
into their former taciturnity.
</p>

<p>I had waited in hope of some opportunity to divert
them, but could find no pass opened for a
single sally; and who can be merry without an object
of mirth? After a few faint efforts, which
produced neither applause nor opposition, I was
content to mingle with the mass, to put round the
glass in silence, and solace myself with my own
contemplations.
</p>

<p>My friend looked round him; the guests stared
at one another; and if now and then a few syllables
were uttered with timidity and hesitation, there
was none ready to make any reply.  All our faculties
were frozen, and every minute took away from

<pb n="289"/>

our capacity of pleasing, and disposition to be
pleased.  Thus passed the hours to which so much
happiness was decreed; the hours which had, by a
kind of open proclamation, been devoted to wit,
to mirth, and to Hilarius.
</p>

<p>At last the night came on, and the necessity of
parting freed us from the persecutions of each other.
I heard them, as they walked along the court, murmuring
at the loss of the day, and inquiring whether
any man would pay a second visit to a house haunted
by a wit.
</p>

<p>Demochares, whose benevolence is greater than
his penetration, having flattered his hopes with the
secondary honour which he was to gain by my
sprightliness and elegance, and the affection with
which he should be followed for a perpetual banquet
of gaiety, was not able to conceal his vexation and
resentment,nor would easily be convinced,that I had
not sacrificed his interest to sullenness and caprice,
and studiously endeavoured to disgust his guests,
and suppressed my powers of delighting, in obstinate
and premeditated silence.  I am informed that
the reproach of their ill reception is divided by the
gentlemen of the country between us, some being
of opinion that my friend is deluded by an impostor,
who, though he has found some art of gaining his
favour, is afraid to speak before men of more penetration;
and others concluding that I think only
London the proper theatre of my abilities, and disdain
to exert my genius for the praise of rusticks.
</p>

<p>I believe, Mr. Rambler, that it has sometimes

<pb n="290"/>

happened to others, who have the good or ill fortune
to be celebrated for wits, to fall under the
same censures upon the like occasions.  I hope therefore
that you will prevent any misrepresentations
of such failures, by remarking that invention is not
wholly at the command of its possessor; that the
power of pleasing is very often obstructed by the
desire; that all expectation lessens surprise, yet
some surprise is necessary to gaiety; and that those
who desire to partake of the pleasure of wit must
contribute to its production, since the mind stagnates
without external ventilation, and that effervescence
of the fancy, which flashes into transport,
can be raised only by the infusion of dissimilar
ideas.

<p>"LIFE," says Seneca, "is a voyage, in the
progress of which we are perpetually changing
our scenes: we first leave childhood behind us,
then youth, then the years of ripened manhood, then

<pb n="291"/>

the better and more pleasing part of old age."  The
perusal of this passage having incited in me a train
of reflections on the state of man, the incessant
fluctuation of his wishes, the gradual change of his
disposition to all external objects, and the thoughtlessness
with which he floats along the stream of
time, I sunk into a slumber amidst my meditations,
and on a sudden, found my ears filled with the
tumult of labour, the shouts of alacrity, the shrieks
of alarm, the whistle of winds, and the dash of
waters.
</p>

<p>My astonishment for a time repressed my curiosity;
but soon recovering myself so far as to inquire
whither we were going, and what was the
cause of such clamour and confusion, I was told
that we were launching out into the <hi rend="italic">ocean of
life</hi>;
that we had already passed the streights of infancy,
in which multitudes had perished, some by the
weakness and fragility of their vessels, and more
by the folly, perverseness, or negligence, of those
who undertook to steer them; and that we were
now on the main sea, abandoned to the winds and
billows, without any other means of security than
the care of the pilot, whom it was always in our
power to choose among great numbers that offered
their direction and assistance.
</p>

<p>I then looked round with anxious eagerness; and
first turning my eyes behind me, saw a stream
flowing through flowery islands, which every one
that sailed along seemed to behold with pleasure;
but no sooner touched, than the current, which,

<pb n="292"/>

though not noisy or turbulent, was yet irresistible,
bore him away.  Beyond these islands all was darkness,
nor could any of the passengers describe the
shore at which he first embarked.
</p>

<p>Before me, and on each side, was an expanse of
waters violently agitated, and covered with so thick
a mist, that the most perspicacious eye could see
but a little way.  It appeared to be full of rocks and
whirlpools, for many sunk unexpectedly while they
were courting the gale with full sails, and insulting
those whom they had left behind.  So numerous,
indeed, were the dangers, and so thick the darkness,
that no caution could confer security.  Yet there
were many, who, by false intelligence, betrayed
their followers into whirlpools, or by violence
pushed those whom they found in their way
against the rocks.
</p>

<p>The current was invariable and insurmountable;
but though it was impossible to sail against it, or to
return to the place that was once passed, yet it was
not so violent as to allow no opportunities for dexterity
or courage, since, though none could retreat
back from danger, yet they might often avoid it by
oblique direction.
</p>

<p>It was, however, not very common to steer with
much care or prudence; for by some universal infatuation,
every man appeared to think himself safe,
though he saw his consorts every moment sinking
round him; and no sooner had the waves closed over
them, than their fate and misconduct were forgotten;
the voyage was pursued with the same jocund

<pb n="293"/>

confidence; every man congratulated himself upon
the soundness of his vessel, and believed himself
able to stem the whirlpool in which his friend was
swallowed, or glide over the rocks on which he was
dashed: nor was it often observed that the sight of
a wreck made any man change his course: if he
turned aside for a moment, he soon forgot the rudder,
and left himself again to the disposal of chance.
</p>

<p>This negligence did not proceed from indifference,
or from weariness of their present condition; for not
one of those who thus rushed upon destruction,
failed, when he was sinking, to call loudly upon his
associates for that help which could not now be given
him; and many spent their last moments in cautioning
others against the folly by which they were
intercepted in the midst of their course.  Their benevolence
was sometimes praised, but their admonitions
were unregarded.
</p>

<p>The vessels in which we had embarked being confessedly
unequal to the turbulence of the stream
of life, were visibly impaired in the course of the
voyage; so that every passenger was certain, that
how long soever he might, by favourable accidents,
or by incessant vigilance, be preserved, he must sink
at last.
</p>

<p>This necessity of perishing might have been expected
to sadden the gay, and intimidate the daring,
at least to keep the melancholy and timorous in
perpetual torments, and hinder them from any enjoyment
of the varieties and gratifications which
nature offered them as the solace of their labours;

<pb n="294"/>

yet, in effect, none seemed less to expect destruction
than those to whom it was most dreadful; they
all had the art of concealing their danger from themselves;
and those who knew their inability to bear
the sight of the terrours that embarrassed their way,
took care never to look forward, but found some
amusement for the present moment, and generally
entertained themselves by playing with Hope, who
was the constant associate of the voyage of life.
</p>

<p>Yet all that Hope ventured to promise, even to
those whom she favoured most, was not that they
should escape, but that they should sink last; and
with this promise every one was satisfied, though
he laughed at the rest for seeming to believe it.
Hope, indeed, apparently mocked the credulity of
her companions; for, in proportion as their vessels
grew leaky, she redoubled her assurances of safety;
and none were more busy in making provisions for
a long voyage, than they whom all but themselves
saw likely to perish soon by irreparable decay.
</p>

<p>In the midst of the current of life was the <hi rend="italic">gulph
of</hi> Intemperance, a dreadful whirlpool, interspersed
with rocks, of which the pointed crags were concealed
under water, and the tops covered with herbage,
on which Ease spread couches of repose, and
with shades, where Pleasure warbled the song of
invitation.  Within sight of these rocks all who sailed
on the ocean of life must necessarily pass.  Reason,
indeed, was always at hand to steer the passengers
through a narrow outlet by which they might
escape; but very few could, by her entreaties or

<pb n="295"/>

remonstrances, be induced to put the rudder into
her hand, without stipulating that she should approach
so near unto the rocks of Pleasure, that
they might solace themselves with a short enjoyment
of that delicious region, after which they
always determined to pursue their course without
any other deviation.
</p>

<p>Reason was too often prevailed upon so far by
these promises, as to venture her charge within the
eddy of the gulph of Intemperance, where, indeed,
the circumvolution was weak, but yet interrupted
the course of the vessel, and drew it, by insensible
rotations, towards the centre.  She then repented
her temerity, and with all her force endeavoured to
retreat; but the draught of the gulph was generally
too strong to be overcome; and the passenger, having
danced in circles with a pleasing and giddy
velocity, was at last overwhelmed and lost.  Those
few whom Reason was able to extricate, generally
suffered so many shocks upon the points which
shot out from the rocks of Pleasure, that they were
unable to continue their course with the same
strength and facility as before, but floated along
timorously and feeble, endangered by every breeze,
and shattered by every ruffle of the water, till they
sunk, by slow degrees, after long struggles, and
innumerable expedients, always repining at their own
folly, and warning others against the first approach
of the gulph of Intemperance.
</p>

<p>There were artists who professed to repair the
breaches and stop the leaks of the vessels which had

<pb n="296"/>

been shattered on the rocks of Pleasure.  Many
appeared to have great confidence in their skill, and
some, indeed, were preserved by it from sinking,
who had received only a single blow; but I remarked
that few vessels lasted long which had been
much repaired, nor was it found that the artists
themselves continued afloat longer than those who
had least of their assistance.
</p>

<p>The only advantage which, in the voyage of life,
the cautious had above the negligent, was, that
they sunk later, and more suddenly; for they passed
forward till they had sometimes seen all those in
whose company they had issued from the streights
in infancy, perish in the way, and at last were overset
by a cross breeze, without the toil of resistance,
or the anguish of expectation.  But such as had
often fallen against the rocks of Pleasure, commonly
subsided by sensible degrees, contended long
with the encroaching waters, and harassed themselves
by labours that scarce Hope herself could
flatter with success.
</p>

<p>As I was looking upon the various fate of the
multitude about me, I was suddenly alarmed with
an admonition from some unknown Power, "Gaze
not idly upon others when thou thyself art sinking.
Whence is this thoughtless tranquillity, when thou
and they are equally endangered?" I looked, and
seeing the gulph of Intemperance before me,
started and awaked.

</epigraph>

<p>CURIOSITY is one of the permanent and certain
characteristicks of a vigorous intellect.
Every advance into knowledge opens new prospects,
and produces new incitements to further
progress.  All the attainments possible in our present
state are evidently inadequate to our capacities
of enjoyment; conquest serves no purpose but that
of kindling ambition, discovery has no effect but of
raising expectation; the gratification of one desire
encourages another; and after all our labours, studies,
and inquiries, we are continually at the same
distance from the completion of our schemes, have
still some wish importunate to be satisfied, and
some faculty restless and turbulent for want of its
enjoyment.
</p>

<p>The desire of knowledge, though often animated
by extrinsick and adventitious motives, seems on
many occasions to operate without subordination
to any other principle; we are eager to see and hear,
without intention of referring our observations to
a farther end; we climb a mountain for a prospect
of the plain; we run to the strand in a storm, that
we may contemplate the agitation of the water;
we range from city to city, though we profess
neither architecture nor fortification; we cross seas
only to view nature in nakedness, or magnificence

<pb n="298"/>

in ruins; we are equally allured by novelty of every
kind, by a desert or a palace, a cataract or a cavern,
by every thing rude and every thing polished,
every thing great and every thing little; we do not
see a thicket but with some temptation to enter it,
nor remark an insect flying before us but with an
inclination to pursue it.
</p>

<p>This passion is, perhaps, regularly heightened in
proportion as the powers of the mind are elevated
and enlarged.  Lucan therefore introduces C&aelig;sar
speaking with dignity suitable to the grandeur of
his designs and the extent of his capacity, when he
declares to the high-priest of Egypt, that he has no
desire equally powerful with that of finding the
origin of the Nile, and that he would quit all the
projects of the civil war for a sight of those fountains
which had been so long concealed.  And
Homer, when he would furnish the Sirens with a
temptation, to which his hero, renowned for wisdom,
might yield without disgrace, makes them
declare, that none ever departed from them but
with increase of knowledge.
</p>

<p>There is, indeed, scarce any kind of ideal acquirement
which may not be applied to some use, or
which may not at least gratify pride with occasional
superiority; but whoever attends the motions
of his own mind will find, that upon the first appearance
of an object, or the first start of a question,
his inclination to a nearer view, or more accurate
discussion, precedes all thoughts of profit, or of
competition; and that his desires take wing by in-
<pb n="299"/>

stantaneous impulse, though their flight may be
invigorated, or their efforts renewed, by subsequent
considerations.  The gratification of curiosity rather
frees us from uneasiness than confers pleasure; we
are more pained by ignorance, than delighted by
instruction.  Curiosity is the thirst of the soul; it
inflames and torments us, and makes us taste every
thing with joy, however otherwise insipid, by which
it may be quenched.
</p>

<p>It is evident that the earliest searchers after
knowledge must have proposed knowledge only as
their reward; and that science, though perhaps the
nursling of interest, was the daughter of curiosity:
for who can believe that they who first watched the
course of the stars, foresaw the use of their discoveries
to the facilitation of commerce, or the mensuration
of time? They were delighted with the
splendour of the nocturnal skies, they found that
the lights changed their places; what they admired
they were anxious to understand, and in time traced
their revolutions.
</p>

<p>There are, indeed, beings in the form of men,
who appear satisfied with their intellectual possessions,
and seem to live without desire of enlarging
their conceptions; before whom the world passes
without notice, and who are equally unmoved by
nature or by art.
</p>

<p>This negligence is sometimes only the temporary
effect of a predominant passion: a lover finds no
inclination to travel any path, but that which leads
to the habitation of his mistress; a trader can spare

<pb n="300"/>

little attention to common occurrences, when his
fortune is endangered by a storm.  It is frequently
the consequence of a total immersion in sensuality;
corporeal pleasures may be indulged till the memory
of every other kind of happiness is obliterated; the
mind, long habituated to a lethargick and quiescent
state, is unwilling to wake to the toil of thinking;
and though she may sometimes be disturbed by
the obtrusion of new ideas, shrinks back again to
ignorance and rest.
</p>

<p>But, indeed, if we except them to whom the continual
task of procuring the supports of life, denies
all opportunities of deviation from their own narrow
track, the number of such as live without the ardour
of inquiry is very small, though many content
themselves with cheap amusements, and waste their
lives in researches of no importance.
</p>

<p>There is no snare more dangerous to busy and
excursive minds, than the cobwebs of petty inquisitiveness,
which entangle them in trivial employments
and minute studies, and detain them in a
middle state, between the tediousness of total inactivity,
and the fatigue of laborious efforts, enchant
them at once with ease and novelty, and vitiate
them with the luxury of learning.  The necessity of
doing something, and the fear of undertaking much,
sinks the historian to a genealogist, the philosopher
to a journalist ofthe weather, and the mathematician
to a constructor of dials.
</p>

<p>It is happy when those who cannot content themselves
to be idle, nor resolve to be industrious, are

<pb n="301"/>

at least employed without injury to others; but it
seldom happens that we can contain ourselves long
in a neutral state, or forbear to sink into vice, when
we are no longer soaring towards virtue.
</p>

<p>Nugaculus was distinguished in his earlier years
by an uncommon liveliness of imagination, quickness
of sagacity, and extent of knowledge.  When
he entered into life, he applied himself with particular
inquisitiveness to examine the various motives
of human actions, the complicated influence
of mingled affections, the different modifications of
interest and ambition, and the various causes of
miscarriage and success both in public and private
affairs.
</p>

<p>Though his friends did not discover to what purpose
all these observations were collected, or how
Nugaculus would much improve his virtue or his
fortune by an incessant attention to changes of
countenance, bursts of inconsideration, sallies of passion,
and all the other casualties by which he used
to trace a character, yet they could not deny the
study of human nature to be worthy of a wise man;
they therefore flattered his vanity, applauded his
discoveries, and listened with submissive modesty
to his lectures on the uncertainty of inclination, the
weakness of resolves, and the instability of temper,
to his account of the various motives which agitate
the mind, and his ridicule of the modern dream of
a ruling passion.
</p>

<p>Such was the first incitement of Nugaculus to a
close inspection into the conduct of mankind.  He

<pb n="302"/>

had no interest in view, and therefore no design of
supplantation; he had no malevolence, and therefore
detected faults without any intention to expose
them; but having once found the art of engaging
his attention upon others, he had no inclination to
call it back to himself, but has passed his time in
keeping a watchful eye upon every rising character,
and lived upon a small estate without any thought
of increasing it.
</p>

<p>He is, by continual application, become a general
master of secret history, and can give an account of
the intrigues, private marriages, competitions, and
stratagems, of half a century.  He knows the mortgages
upon every man's estate, the terms upon
which every spendthrift raises his money, the real
and reputed fortune of every lady, the jointure
stipulated by every contract, and the expectations
of every family from maiden aunts and childless
acquaintances.  He can relate the economy of every
house, knows how much one man's cellar is robbed
by his butler, and the land of another underlet by
his steward; he can tell where the manor-house is
falling, though large sums are yearly paid for repairs;
and where the tenants are felling woods without
the consent of the owner.
</p>

<p>To obtain all this intelligence he is inadvertently
guilty of a thousand acts of treachery.  He sees no
man's servant without draining him of his trust; he
enters no family without flattering the children into
discoveries; he is a perpetual spy upon the doors of
his neighbours; and knows by long experience, at

<pb n="303"/>

whatever distance, the looks of a creditor, a borrower,
a lover, and a pimp.
</p>

<p>Nugaculus is not ill-natured, and therefore his
industry has not hitherto been very mischievous to
others, or dangerous to himself: but since he cannot
enjoy this knowledge but by discovering it, and, if
he had no other motive to loquacity, is obliged to
traffick like the chymists, and purchase one secret
with another, he is every day more hated as he is
more known; for he is considered by great numbers
as one that has their fame and their happiness in his
power, and no man can much love him of whom he
lives in fear.
</p>

<p>Thus has an intention, innocent at first, if not
laudable, the intention of regulating his own behaviour
by the experience of others, by an accidental
declension of minuteness, betrayed Nugaculus, not
only to a foolish, but vicious waste of a life which
might have been honourably passed in publick services,
or domestick virtues.  He has lost his original
intention, and given up his mind to employments
that engross, but do not improve it.

</lg>



<p> None e'er rejects hyperboles of praise.
</p>

</epigraph>

<p>THE apparent insufficiency of every individual
to his own happiness or safety, compels us to
seek from one another assistance and support.  The
necessity of joint edorts for the execution of any

<pb n="304"/>

great or extensive design, the variety of powers
disseminated in the species, and the proportion
between the defects and excellencies of different
persons, demand an interchange of help, and communication
of intelligence, and by frequent reciprocations
of beneficence unite mankind in society
and friendship.
</p>

<p>If it can be imagined that there ever was a time
when the inhabitants of any country were in a state
of equality, without distinction of rank, or peculiarity
of possessions, it is reasonable to believe that
every man was then loved in proportion as he could
contribute by his strength, or his skill, to the supply
of natural wants; there was then little room for
peevish dislike, or capricious favour; the affection
admitted into the heart was rather esteem than
tenderness; and kindness was only purchased by
benefits.  But when by force or policy, by wisdom
or by fortune, property and superiority were introduced
and established, so that many were condemned
to labour for the support of a few, then
they whose possessions swelled above their wants,
naturally laid out their superfluities upon pleasure;
and those who could not gain friendship by necessary
offices, endeavoured to promote their interest
by luxurious gratifications, and to create needs,
which they might be courted to supply.
</p>

<p>The desires of mankind are much more numerous
than their attainments, and the capacity of imagination
much larger than actual enjoyment.  Multitudes
are therefore unsatisfied with their allotment;

<pb n="305"/>

and he that hopes to improve his condition by the
favour of another, and either finds no room for the
exertion of great qualities, or perceives himself excelled
by his rivals, will, by other expedients, endeavour
to become agreeable where he cannot be
important, and learn, by degrees, to number the
<hi rend="italic">art of pleasing</hi> among the most useful studies, and
most valuable acquisitions.
</p>

<p>This art,like others, is cultivated in proportion to
its usefulness, and will always flourish most where it
is most rewarded; for this reason we find it practised
with great assiduity under absolute governments,
where honours and riches are in the hands of one
man, whom all endeavour to propitiate, and who
soon becomes so much accustomed to compliance
and officiousness, as not easily to find, in the most
delicate address, that novelty which is necessary to
procure attention.
</p>

<p>It is discovered by a very few experiments, that
no man is much pleased with a companion, who
does not increase, in some respect, his fondness of
himself; and, therefore, he that wishes rather to be
led forward to prosperity by the gentle hand of
favour, than to force his way by labour and merit,
must consider with more care how to display his
patron's excellencies than his own; that whenever
he approaches, he may fill the imagination with
pleasing dreams, and chase away disgust and weariness
by a perpetual succession of delightful images.
</p>

<p>This may, indeed, sometimes be effected by
turning the attention upon advantages which are

<pb n="306"/>

really possessed, or upon prospects which reason
spreads before hope; for whoever can deserve or
require to be courted, has generally, either from
nature or from fortune, gifts, which he may review
with satisfaction, and of which, when he is artfully
recalled to the contemplation, he will seldom be
displeased.
</p>

<p>But those who have once degraded their understanding
to an application only to the passions, and
who have learned to derive hope from any other
sources than industry and virtue, seldom retain
dignity and magnanimity sufficient to defend them
against the constant recurrence of temptation to
falsehood.  He that is too desirous to be loved, will
soon learn to flatter, and when he has exhausted all
the variations of honest praise, and can delight no
longer with the civility of truth, he will invent new
topicks of panegyrick, and break out into raptures at
virtues and beauties conferred by himself.
</p>

<p>The drudgeries of dependance would, indeed, be
aggravated by hopelessness of success, if no indulgence
was allowed to adulation.  He that will
obstinately confine his patron to hear only the
commendations which he deserves, will soon be
forced to give way to others that regale him with
more compass of musick.  The greatest human virtue
bears no proportion to human vanity.  We always
think ourselves better than we are, and are
generally desirous that others should think us still
better than we think ourselves.  To praise us for actions
or dispositions which deserve praise, is not to

<pb n="307"/>

confer a benefit, but to pay a tribute.  We have always
pretensions to fame, which, in our own hearts,
we know to be disputable, and which we are desirous
to strengthen by a new suffrage; we have always
hopes which we suspect to be fallacious, and of
which we eagerly snatch at every confirmation.
</p>

<p>It may, indeed, be proper to make the first approaches
under the conduct of truth, and to secure
credit of future encomiums, by such praise as may
be ratified by the conscience; but the mind once
habituated to the lusciousness of eulogy, becomes,
in a short time, nice and fastidious, and, like a
vitiated palate, is incessantly calling for higher
gratifications.
</p>

<p>It is scarcely credible to what degree discernment
may be dazzled by the mist of pride, and wisdom
infatuated by the intoxication of flattery; or how
low the genius may descend by successive gradations
of servility, and how swiftly it may fall down
the precipice of falsehood.  No man can, indeed, observe,
without indignation, on what names, both of
ancient and modern times, the utmost exuberance
of praise has been lavished, and by what hands it
has been bestowed.  It has never yet been found,
that the tyrant, the plunderer, the oppressor, the
most hateful of the hateful, the most profligate of
the profligate, have been denied any celebrations
which they were willing to purchase, or that wickedness
and folly have not found correspondent flatterers
through all their subordinations, except when
they have been associated with avarice or poverty,

<pb n="308"/>

and have wanted either inclination or ability to hire
a panegyrist.
</p>

<p>As there is no character so deformed as to fright
away from it the prostitutes of praise, there is no
degree of encomiastick veneration which pride has
refused.  The emperors of Rome suffered themselves
to be worshipped in their lives with altars and sacrifices;
and, in an age more enlightened, the terms
peculiar to the praise and worship of the Supreme
Being, have been applied to wretches whom it was
the reproach of humanity to number among men;
and whom nothing but riches or power hindered
those that read or wrote their deification, from
hunting into the toils of justice, as disturbers of the
peace of nature.
</p>

<p>There are, indeed, many among the poetical flatterers,
who must be resigned to infamy without
vindication, and whom we must confess to have
deserted the cause of virtue for pay; they have
committed, against full conviction, the crime of
obliterating the distinctions between good and evil,
and, instead of opposing the encroachments of
vice, have incited her progress, and celebrated her
conquests.  But there is a lower class of sycophants,
whose understanding has not made them capable of
equal guilt.  Every man of high rank is surrounded
with numbers, who have no other rule of thought
or action, than his maxims, and his conduct; whom
the honour of being numbered among his acquaintance,
reconciles to all his vices, and all his absurdities;
and who easily persuade themselves to esteem

<pb n="309"/>

him, by whose regard they consider themselves as
distinguished and exalted.
</p>

<p>It is dangerous for mean minds to venture themselves
within the sphere of greatness.  Stupidity is
soon blinded by the splendour of wealth, and cowardice
is easily fettered in the shackles of dependance.
To solicit patronage, is, at least, in the event,
to set virtue to sale.  None can be pleased without
praise, and few can be praised without falsehood;
few can be assiduous without servility, and none
can be servile without corruption.

<p>I WAS lately considering, among other objects
of speculation, the new attempt of an <hi rend="italic">universal
register</hi>, an office, in which every man may lodge
an account of his superfluities and wants, of whatever
he desires to purchase or to sell.  My imagination
soon presented to me the latitude to which
this design may be extended by integrity and industry,
and the advantages which may be justly
hoped from a general mart of intelligence, when
once its reputation shall be so established, that
neither reproach nor fraud shall be feared from it:
when an application to it shall not be censured as
the last resource of desperation, nor its informations

<pb n="310"/>

suspected as the fortuitous suggestions of men
obliged not to appear ignorant.  A place where every
exuberance may be discharged, and every deficiency
supplied; where every lawful passion may find its
gratifications, and every honest curiosity receive
satisfaction; where the stock of a nation, pecuniary
and intellectual, may be brought together, and
where all conditions of humanity may hope to find
relief, pleasure, and accommodation; must equally
deserve the attention of the merchant and philosopher,
of him who mingles in the tumult of business,
and him who only lives to amuse himself with the
various employments and pursuits of others.  Nor
will it be an uninstructing school to the greatest
masters of method and dispatch, if such multiplicity
can be preserved from embarrassment, and
such tumult from inaccuracy.
</p>

<p>While I was concerting this splendid project,
and filling my thoughts with its regulation, its
conveniences, its variety, and its consequences, I
sunk gradually into slumber; but the same images,
though less distinct, still continued to float upon
my fancy.  I perceived myself at the gate of an
immense edifice, where innumerable multitudes
were passing without confusion; every face on
which I fixed my eyes, seemed settled in the
contemplation of some important purpose, and every
foot was hastened by eagerness and expectation.
I followed the crowd without knowing whither I
should be drawn, and remained a while in the unpleasing
state of an idler, where all other beings

<pb n="311"/>

were busy, giving place every moment to those
who had more importance in their looks.  Ashamed
to stand ignorant, and afraid to ask questions, at
last I saw a lady sweeping by me, whom, by the
quickness of her eyes, the agility of her steps, and
a mixture of levity and impatience, I knew to be
my long-loved protectress, Curiosity.  "Great goddess,"
said I, "may thy votary be permitted to
implore thy favour; if thou hast been my directress
from the first dawn of reason, if I have followed
thee through the maze of life with invariable fidelity,
if I have turned to every new call, and quitted
at thy nod one pursuit for another, if I have never
stopped at the invitations of fortune, nor forgot
thy authority in the bowers of pleasure, inform me
now whither chance has conducted me."
</p>

<p>"Thou art now," replied the smiling power,
"in the presence of Justice, and of Truth, whom
the father of gods and men has sent down to register
the demands and pretentions of mankind, that
the world may at last be reduced to order, and that
none may complain hereafter of being doomed to
tasks for which they are unqualified, of possessing
faculties for which they cannot find employment,
or virtues that languish unobserved for want of
opportunities to exert them, of being encumbered
with superfluities which they would willingly resign,
or of wasting away in desires which ought to be
satisfied.  Justice is now to examine every man's
wishes, and Truth is to record them; let us approach,
and observe the progress of this great transaction."

<pb n="312"/>

</p>

<p>She then moved forward, and Truth, who knew
her among the most faithful of her followers, beckoned
her to advance, till we were placed near the
seat of Justice.  The first who required the assistance
of the office, came forward with a slow pace, and
tumour of dignity, and shaking a weighty purse in
his hand, demanded to be registered by Truth, as
the M&aelig;cenas of the present age, the chief encourager
of literary merit, to whom men of learning and
wit might apply in any exigence or distress with
certainty of succour.  Justice very mildly inquired,
whether he had calculated the expense of such a
declaration? whether he had been informed what
number of petitioners would swarm about him?
whether he could distinguish idleness and negligence
from calamity, ostentation from knowledge,
or vivacity from wit? To these questions he seemed
not well provided with a reply, but repeated his
desire to be recorded as a patron.  Justice then offered
to register his proposal on these conditions,
that he should never suffer himself to be flattered;
that he should never delay an audience when he
had nothing to do; and that he should never encourage
followers without intending to reward them.
These terms were too hard to be accepted; for
what, said he, is the end of patronage, but the
pleasure of reading dedications, holding multitudes
in suspense, and enjoying their hopes, their fears,
and their anxiety, flattering them to assiduity, and,
at last, dismissing them for impatience? Justice
heard his confession, and ordered his name to be

<pb n="318"/>

posted upon the gate among cheats and robbers,
and publick nuisances, which all were by that notice
warned to avoid.
</p>

<p>Another required to be made known as the
discoverer of a new art of education, by which
languages and sciences might be taught to all
capacities, and all inclinations, without fear of
punishment, pain or confinement, loss of any part of
the gay mien of ignorance, or any obstruction of the
necessary progress in dress, dancing, or cards.
</p>

<p>Justice and Truth did not trouble this great adept
with many inquiries; but finding his address awkward
and his speech barbarous, ordered him to be
registered as a tall fellow who wanted employment,
and might serve in any post where the knowledge
of reading and writing was not required.
</p>

<p>A man of very grave and philosophick aspect,
required notice to be given of his intention to set
out, a certain day, on a submarine voyage, and of
his willingness to take in passengers for no more
than double the price at which they might sail
above water.  His desire was granted, and he retired
to a convenient stand, in expectation of filling his
ship, and growing rich in a short time by the
secrecy, safety, and expedition of the passage.
</p>

<p>Another desired to advertise the curious, that he
had, for the advancement of true knowledge, contrived
an optical instrument, by which those who
laid out their industry on memorials of the changes
of the wind, might observe the direction of the
weather-cocks on the hither side of the lunar world.

<pb n="314"/>

</p>

<p>Another wished to be known as the author of an
invention, by which cities or kingdoms might be
made warm in winter by a single fire, a kettle, and
pipe.  Another had a vehicle by which a man might
bid defiance to floods, and continue floating in an
inundation, without any inconvenience, till the
water should subside.  Justice considered these projects
as of no importance but to their authors, and
therefore scarcely condescended to examine them:
but Truth refused to admit them into the register.
</p>

<p>Twenty different pretenders came in one hour to
give notice of an universal medicine, by which all
diseases might be cured or prevented, and life
protracted beyond the age of Nestor.  But Justice
informed them, that one universal medicine was
sufficient, and she would delay the notification till
she saw who could longest preserve his own life.
</p>

<p>A thousand other claims and offers were exhibited
and examined.  I remarked, among this mighty
multitude, that, of intellectual advantages, many
had great exuberance, and few confessed any want;
of every art there were a hundred professors for a
single pupil; but of other attainments, such as riches,
honours, and preferments, I found none that had
too much, but thousands and ten thousands that
thought themselves entitled to a larger dividend.
</p>

<p>It often happened, that old misers, and women
married at the close of life, advertised their want
of children; nor was it uncommon for those who
had a numerous offspring, to give notice of a son or
daughter to be spared; but, though appearances

<pb n="315"/>

promised well on both sides, the bargain seldom succeeded;
for they soon lost their inclination to adopted
children, and proclaimed their intentions to promote
some scheme of publick charity: a thousand proposals
were immediately made, among which they
hesitated till death precluded the decision.
</p>

<p>As I stood looking on this scene of confusion,
Truth condescended to ask me, what was my business
at her office? I was struck with the unexpected
question, and awaked by my efforts to answer it.

<p>IT is necessary to the success of flattery, that it
be accommodated to particular circumstances or
characters, and enter the heart on that side where
the passions stand ready to receive it.  A lady seldom
listens with attention to any praise but that
of her beauty; a merchant always expects to hear
of his influence at the bank, his importance on the
exchange, the height of his credit, and the extent
of his traffick: and the author will scarcely be pleased
without lamentations of the neglect of learning,
the conspiracies against genius, and the slow progress
of merit, or some praises of the magnanimity
of those who encounter poverty and contempt in
the cause of knowledge, and trust for the reward
of their labours to the judgment and gratitude of
posterity.

<pb n="316"/>

</p>

<p>An assurance of unfading laurels, and immortal
reputation, is the settled reciprocation of civility
between amicable writers.  To raise <hi rend="italic">monuments more
durable than brass, and more conspicuous than pyramids</hi>,
has been long the common boast of literature;
but, among the innumerable architects that erect
columns to themselves, far the greater part, either
for want of durable materials, or of art to dispose
them, see their edifices perish as they are towering
to completion, and those few that for a while attract
the eye of mankind, are generally weak in the
foundation, and soon sink by the saps of time.
</p>

<p>No place affords a more striking conviction of
the vanity of human hopes, than a publick library;
for who can see the wall crowded on every side by
mighty volumes, the works of laborious meditation,
and accurate inquiry, now scarcely known but by
the catalogue, and preserved only to increase the
pomp of learning, without considering how many
hours have been wasted in vain endeavours, how
often imagination has anticipated the praises of
futurity, how many statues have risen to the eye of
vanity, how many ideal converts have elevated zeal,
how often wit has exulted in the eternal infamy of
his antagonists, and dogmatism has delighted in the
gradual advances of his authority, the immutability
of his decrees, and the perpetuity of his power?

<p>Of the innumerable authors whose performances
are thus treasured up in magnificent obscurity,
most are forgotten, because they never deserved to
be remembered, and owed the honours which they
once obtained, not to judgment or to genius, to
labour or to art, but to the prejudice of faction,
the stratagem of intrigue, or the servility of
adulation.
</p>

<p>Nothing is more common than to find men whose
works are now totally neglected, mentioned with
praises by their contemporaries, as the oracles of
their age, and the legislators of science.  Curiosity is
naturally excited, their volumes after long inquiry
are found, but seldom reward the labour of the
search.  Every period of time has produced these
bubbles of artificial fame, which are kept up a while
by the breath of fashion, and then break at once,
and are annihilated.  The learned often bewail the
loss of ancient writers whose characters have survived
their works; but, perhaps, if we could now
retrieve them, we should find them only the Granvilles,
Montagues, Stepneys, and Sheffelds of their
time, and wonder by what infatuation or caprice they
could be raised to notice.
</p>

<p>It cannot, however, be denied, that many have
sunk into oblivion, whom it were unjust to number
with this despicable class.  Various kinds of literary
fame seem destined to various measures of duration.
Some spread into exuberance with a very speedy
growth, but soon wither and decay; some rise more
slowly, but last long.  Parnassus has its flowers of

<pb n="318"/>

transient fragrance, as well as its oaks of towering
height, and its laurels of eternal verdure.
</p>

<p>Among those whose reputation is exhausted in a
short time by its own luxuriance, are the writers
who take advantage of present incidents or characters
which strongly interest the passions, and engage
universal attention.  It is not difficult to obtain readers,
when we discuss a question which every one is
desirous to understand, which is debated in every
assembly, and has divided the nation into parties;
or when we display the faults or virtues of him
whose publick conduct has made almost every
man his enemy or his friend.  To the quick circulation
of such productions all the motives of
interest and vanity concur; the disputant enlarges
his knowledge, the zealot animates his passion,
and every man is desirous to inform himself concerning
affairs so vehemently agitated and variously
represented.
</p>

<p>It is scarcely to be imagined, through how many
subordinations of interest the ardour of party is
diffused; and what multitudes fancy themselves
affected by every satire or panegyrick on a man of
eminence.  Whoever has, at any time, taken occasion
to mention him with praise or blame, whoever happens
to love or hate any of his adherents, as he
wishes to conform his opinion, and to strengthen
his party, will diligently peruse every paper from
which he can hope for sentiments like his own.  An
object, however small in itself, if placed near to the
eye, will engross all the rays of light; and a trans-
<pb n="319"/>

action, however trivial, swells into importance when
it presses immediately on our attention.  He that
shall peruse the political pamphlets of any past
reign, will wonder why they were so eagerly read,
or so loudly praised.  Many of the performances
which had power to inflame factions, and fill a kingdom
with confusion, have now very little effect upon
a frigid critick; and the time is coming, when the
compositions of later hirelings shall lie equally
despised.  In proportion as those who write on temporary
subjects, are exalted above their merit at
first, they are afterwards depressed below it; nor
can the brightest elegance of diction, or most artful
subtilty of reasoning, hope for so much esteem from
those whose regard is no longer quickened by curiosity
or pride.
</p>

<p>It is, indeed, the fate of controvertists, even when
they contend for philosophical or theological truth,
to be soon laid aside and slighted.  Either the question
is decided, and there is no more place for doubt
and opposition; or mankind despair of understanding
it, and grow weary of disturbance, content
themselves with quiet ignorance, and refuse to be
harassed with labours which they have no hopes
of recompensing with knowledge.
</p>

<p>The authors of new discoveries may surely expect
to be reckoned among those whose writings are
secure of veneration: yet it often happens that the
general reception of a doctrine obscures the books
in which it was delivered.  When any tenet is generally
received and adopted as an incontrovertible

<pb n="320"/>

principle, we seldom look back to the arguments
upon which it was first established, or can bear that
tediousness of deduction, and multiplicity of evidence,
by which its author was forced to reconcile
it to prejudice, and fortify it in the weakness of
novelty against obstinacy and envy.
</p>

<p>It is well known how much of our philosophy is
derived from Boyle's discovery of the qualities of
the air; yet of those who now adopt or enlarge his
theory, very few have read the detail of his experiments.
His name is, indeed, reverenced; but his
works are neglected; we are contented to know,
that he conquered his opponents, without inquiring
what cavils were produced against him, or by what
proofs they were confuted.
</p>

<p>Some writers apply themselves to studies boundless
and inexhaustible, as experiments in natural
philosophy.  These are always lost in successive
compilations, as new advances are made, and former
observations become more familiar.  Others spend
their lives in remarks on language, or explanations
of antiquities, and only afford materials for
lexicographers and commentators, who are themselves
overwhelmed by subsequent collectors, that equally
destroy the memory of their predecessors by amplification,
transposition, or contraction.  Every new
system of nature gives birth to a swarm of expositors,
whose business is to explain and illustrate it,
and who can hope to exist no longer than the
founder of their sect preserves his reputation.
</p>

<p>There are, indeed, few kinds of composition from

<pb n="321"/>

which an author, however learned or ingenious, can
hope a long continuance of fame.  He who has carefully
studied human nature, and can well describe
it, may with most reason flatter his ambition.
Bacon, among all his pretensions to the regard of
posterity, seems to have pleased himself chiefly with
his Essays, <hi rend="italic">which come home to men's business and
bosoms</hi>, and of which, therefore, he declares his expectation,
that they <hi rend="italic">will live as long as books last</hi>.  It
may, however, satisfy an honest and benevolent
mind to have been useful, though less conspicuous;
nor will he that extends his hope to higher rewards,
be so much anxious to obtain praise, as to discharge
the duty which Providence assigns him.

<p>AMONG the various censures, which the
unavoidable comparison of my performances with
those of my predecessors has produced, there is
none more general than that of uniformity.  Many
of my readers remark the want of those changes of
colours, which formerly fed the attention with
unexhausted novelty, and of that intermixture
of subjects, or alternation of manner, by which
other writers relieved weariness, and awakened
expectation.

<pb n="322"/>

</p>

<p>I have, indeed, hitherto avoided the practice of
uniting gay and solemn subjects in the same paper,
because it seems absurd for an author to counteract
himself, to press at once with equal force upon both
parts of the intellectual balance, or give medicines,
which, like the double poison of Dryden, destroy
the force of one another.  I have endeavoured sometimes
to divert, and sometimes to elevate; but have
imagined it an useless attempt to disturb merriment
by solemnity, or interrupt seriousness by
drollery.  Yet I shall this day publish two letters of
very different tendency, which I hope, like tragi-comedy, may chance to please even when they are
not critically approved.
</p>

<p><q>TO THE RAMBLER.<lb/>DEAR SIR,</q></p>

<p>THOUGH, as my mamma tells me, I am too young to talk at the table, I
have great pleasure in listening to the conversation of learned men,
especially when they discourse of things which I do not understand; and
have, therefore, been of late particularly delighted with many disputes
about the <hi rend="italic">alteration of the stile</hi>, which,
they say, is to be made by act of parliament.  </p>

<p>One day when my mamma was gone out of the
room, I asked a very great scholar what the stile
was.  He told me, he was afraid I should hardly
understand him when he informed me, that it was
the stated and established method of computing
time.  It was not, indeed, likely that I should under-
<pb n="323"/>

stand him; for I never yet knew time computed in
my life, nor can imagine why we should be at so
much trouble to count what we cannot keep.  He
did not tell me whether we are to count the time
past, or the time to come; but I have considered
them both by myself, and think it as foolish to count
time that is gone, as money that is spent; and as
for the time which is to come, it only seems farther
off by counting; and therefore, when any pleasure
is promised me, I always think of the time as little
as I can.
</p>

<p>I have since listened very attentively to every
one that talked upon this subject, of whom the
greater part seem not to understand it better than
myself; for though they often hint how much the
nation has been mistaken, and rejoice that we are at
last growing wiser than our ancestors, I have never
been able to discover from them, that any body has
died sooner or been married later for counting time
wrong; and, therefore, I began to fancy that there
was a great bustle with little consequence.
</p>

<p>At last, two friends of my papa, Mr. Cycle, and
Mr. Starlight, being, it seems, both of high learning,
and able to make an almanack, began to talk
about the new stile.  Sweet Mr. Starlight&mdash;I am
sure I shall love his name as long as I live; for he
told Cycle roundly, with a fierce look, that we
should never be right without a <hi rend="italic">year of confusion</hi>.
Dear Mr. Rambler, did you ever hear any thing so
charming? a whole year of confusion! When there
has been a rout at mamma's, I have thought one

<pb n="324"/>

night of confusion worth a thousand nights of rest;
and if I can but see a year of confusion, a whole
year, of cards in one room, and dancings in another,
here a feast, and there a masquerade, and plays, and
coaches, and hurries, and messages, and milliners,
and raps at the door, and visits, and frolicks, and
new fashions, I shall not care what they do with the
rest of the time, nor whether they count it by the
old stile or the new; for I am resolved to break
loose from the nursery in the tumult, and play my
part among the rest; and it will be strange if I cannot
get a husband and a chariot in the year of
confusion.
</p>

<p>Cycle, who is neither so young nor so handsome
as Starlight, very gravely maintained, that all the
perplexity may be avoided by leaping over eleven
days in the reckoning; and indeed, if it should come
only to this, I think the new stile is a delightful
thing; for my mamma says I shall go to court when
I am sixteen, and if they can but contrive often to
leap over eleven days together, the months of restraint
will soon be at an end.  It is strange, that
with all the plots that have been laid against time,
they could never kill it by act of parliament before.
Dear Sir, if you have any vote or interest, get them
but for once to destroy eleven months, and then
I shall be as old as some married ladies.  But this is
desired only if you think they will not comply with
Mr. Starlight's scheme; for nothing surely could
please me like a year of confusion, when I shall no
longer be fixed this hour to my pen, and the next

<pb n="325"/>

to my needle, or wait at home for the dancing-master one day, and the next for the musick-master;
but run from ball to ball, and from drum to
drum; and spend all my time without tasks, and
without account, and go without telling whither,
and come home without regard to prescribed hours,
or family-rules.
</p>

<p><q>
I am, Sir,<lb/>
Your humble Servant,<lb/>
<name>PROPERANTIA.
</name></q></p>

<p><q>MR. RAMBLER,</q></p>

<p>I WAS seized this morning with an unusual pensiveness,
and, finding that books only served to
heighten it, took a ramble into the fields, in hopes
of relief and invigoration from the keenness of the
air and brightness of the sun.
</p>

<p>As I wandered wrapped up in thought, my eyes
were struck with the hospital for the reception of
deserted infants, which I surveyed with pleasure,
till, by a natural train of sentiment, I began to reflect
on the fate of the mothers.  For to what shelter
can they fly? Only to the arms of their betrayer,
which perhaps are now no longer open to receive
them; and then how quick must be the transition
from deluded virtue to shameless guilt, and from
shameless guilt to hopeless wretchedness?
</p>

<p>The anguish that I felt, left me no rest till I had,
by your means, addressed myself to the public on
behalf of those forlorn creatures, the women of the
town; whose misery here might satisfy the most
rigorous censor, and whose participation of our com-
<pb n="326"/>

mon nature might surely induce us to endeavour,
at least, their preservation from eternal punishment.
</p>

<p>These were all once, if not virtuous, at least innocent;
and might still have continued blameless and
easy, but for the arts and insinuations of those whose
rank, fortune, or education, furnished them with
means to corrupt or to delude them.  Let the libertine
reflect a moment on the situation of that
woman, who, being forsaken by her betrayer, is
reduced to the necessity of turning prostitute for
bread, and judge of the enormity of his guilt by the
evils which it produces.
</p>

<p>It cannot be doubted but that numbers follow
this dreadful course of life, with shame, horrour,
and regret; but where can they hope for refuge?
"<hi rend="italic">The world is not their friend, nor the world's
law</hi>."
Their sighs, and tears, and groans, are criminal in
the eye of their tyrants, the bully and the bawd,
who fatten on their misery, and threaten them with
want or a gaol, if they show the least design of
escaping from their bondage.
</p>

<p>"To wipe all tears from off all faces," is a task
too hard for mortals; but to alleviate misfortunes
is often within the most limited power: yet the
opportunities which every day affords of relieving
the most wretched of human beings are overlooked
and neglected, with equal disregard of policy and
goodness.
</p>

<p>There are places, indeed, set apart, to which these
unhappy creatures may resort, when the diseases of
incontinence seize upon them; but if they obtain a

<pb n="327"/>

cure, to what are they reduced? Either to return
with the small remains of beauty to their former
guilt, or perish in the streets with nakedness and
hunger.
</p>

<p>How frequently have the gay and thoughtless,
in their evening frolicks, seen a band of those miserable
females, covered with rags, shivering with cold,
and pining with hunger; and, without either pitying
their calamities, or reflecting upon the cruelty
of those who perhaps first seduced them by caresses
of fondness, or magnificence of promises, go on to
reduce others to the same wretchedness by the same
means!
</p>

<p>To stop the increase of this deplorable multitude,
is undoubtedly the first and most pressing consideration.
To prevent evil is the great end of government,
the end for which vigilance and severity are properly
employed.  But surely those whom passion or interest
have already depraved, have some claim to compassion,
from beings equally frail and fallible with
themselves.  Nor will they long groan in their present
afflictions, if none were to refuse them relief, but
those that owe their exemption from the same
distress only to their wisdom and their virtue.

</epigraph>

<p>AN ancient poet, unreasonably discontented at
the present state of things, which his system of
opinions obliged him to represent in its worst form,
has observed of the earth, "that its greater part is
covered by the uninhabitable ocean; that of the rest
some is encumbered with naked mountains, and
some lost under barren sands; some scorched with
unintermitted heat, and some petrified with perpetual
frost; so that only a few regions remain for
the production of fruits, the pasture of cattle, and
the accommodation of man."
</p>

<p>The same observation may be transferred to the
time allotted us in our present state.  When we have
deducted all that is absorbed in sleep, all that is
inevitably appropriated to the demands of nature,
or irresistibly engrossed by the tyranny of custom;
all that passes in regulating the superficial decorations
of life, or is given up in the reciprocations of
civility to the disposal of others; all that is torn
from us by the violence of disease, or stolen imperceptibly
away by lassitude and languor; we shall
find that part of our duration very small of which
we can truly call ourselves masters, or which we can

<pb n="329"/>

spend wholly at our own choice.  Many of our hours
are lost in a rotation of petty cares, in a constant
recurrence of the same employments; many of our
provisions for ease or happiness are always exhausted
by the present day; and a great part of our existence
serves no other purpose, than that of enabling us to
enjoy the rest.
</p>

<p>Of the few moments which are left in our disposal,
it may reasonably be expected, that we should
be so frugal, as to let none of them slip from us without
some equivalent; and perhaps it might be found,
that as the earth, however straitened by rocks and
waters, is capable of producing more than all its
inhabitants are able to consume, our lives, though
much contracted by incidental distraction, would
yet afford us a large space vacant to the exercise of
reason and virtue; that we want not time, but diligence,
for great performances; and that we squander
much of our allowance, even while we think it
sparing and insufficient.
</p>

<p>This natural and necessary comminution of our
lives, perhaps, often makes us insensible ofthe negligence
with which we suffer them to slide away.  We
never consider ourselves as possessed at once of time
sufficient for any great design, and therefore indulge
ourselves in fortuitous amusements.  We think it
unnecessary to take an account of a few supernumerary
moments, which, however employed,
could have produced little advantage, and which
were exposed to a thousand chances of disturbance
and interruption.

<pb n="330"/>

</p>

<p>It is observable, that, either by nature or by habit,
our faculties are fitted to images of a certain extent,
to which we adjust great things by division, and
little things by accumulation.  Of extensive surfaces
we can only take a survey, as the parts succeed one
another; and atoms we cannot perceive till they are
united into masses.  Thus we break the vast periods
of time into centuries and years; and thus, if we
would know the amount of moments, we must
agglomerate them into days and weeks.
</p>

<p>The proverbial oracles of our parsimonious ancestors
have informed us, that the fatal waste of fortune
is by small expenses, by the profusion of sums too
little singly to alarm our caution, and which we
never suffer ourselves to consider together.  Of the
same kind is the prodigality of life; he that hopes
to look back hereafter with satisfaction upon past
years, must learn to know the present value of single
minutes, and endeavour to let no particle of time
fall useless to the ground.
</p>

<p>It is usual for those who are advised to the attainment
of any new qualification, to look upon
themselves as required to change the general course
of their conduct, to dismiss business, and exclude
pleasure, and to devote their days and nights to a
particular attention.  But all common degrees of
excellence are attainable at a lower price; he that
should steadily and resolutely assign to any science
or language those interstitial vacancies which intervene
in the most crowded variety of diversion or
employment, would find every day new irradiations

<pb n="331"/>

of knowledge, and discover how much more is to
be hoped from frequency and perseverance, than
from violent efforts and sudden desires; efforts
which are soon remitted when they encounter difficulty,
and desires, which, if they are indulged too
often, will shake off the authority of reason, and
range capriciously from one object to another.
</p>

<p>The disposition to defer every important design
to a time of leisure, and a state of settled uniformity,
proceeds generally from a false estimate of the
human powers.  If we except those gigantic and
stupendous intelligences who are said to grasp a
system by intuition, and bound forward from one
series of conclusions to another, without regular
steps through intermediate propositions, the most
successful students make their advances in knowledge
by short flights, between each of which the
mind may lie at rest.  For every single act of progression
a short time is sufficient; and it is only
necessary, that whenever that time is afforded, it
be well employed.
</p>

<p>Few minds will be long confined to severe and
laborious meditation; and when a successful attack
on knowledge has been made, the student recreates
himself with the contemplation of his conquest, and
forbears another incursion, till the new-acquired
truth has become familiar, and his curiosity calls
upon him for fresh gratifications.  Whether the time
of intermission is spent in company, or in solitude,
in necessary business, or in voluntary levities, the
understanding is equally abstracted from the object

<pb n="332"/>

of inquiry; but, perhaps, if it be detained by occupations
less pleasing, it returns again to study with
greater alacrity than when it is glutted with ideal
pleasures, and surfeited with intemperance of application.
He that will not suffer himself to be discouraged
by fancied impossibilities, may sometimes
find his abilities invigorated by the necessity of exerting
them in short intervals, as the force of a current
is increased by the contraction of its channel.
</p>

<p>From some cause like this, it has probably proceeded,
that, among those who have contributed to
the advancement of learning, many have risen to
eminence in opposition to all the obstacles which
external circumstances could place in their way,
amidst the tumult of business, the distresses of
poverty, or the dissipations of a wandering and unsettled
state.  A great part of the life of Erasmus
was one continual peregrination; ill supplied with
the gifts of fortune, and led from city to city, and
from kingdom to kingdom, by the hopes of patrons
and preferment, hopes which always flattered and
always deceived him; he yet found means, by unshaken
constancy, and a vigilant improvement of
those hours, which, in the midst of the most restless
activity, will remain unengaged, to write more than
another in the same condition would have hoped to
read.  Compelled by want to attendance and solicitation,
and so much versed in common life, that he
has transmitted to us the most perfect delineation
of the manners of his age, he joined to his knowledge
of the world such application to books, that

<pb n="333"/>

he will stand for ever in the first rank of literary
heroes.  How this proficiency was obtained he sufficiently
discovers, by informing us, that the "Praise
of Folly," one of his most celebrated performances,
was composed by him on the road to Italy; <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italic">ne
totum illud tempus quo equo fuit insidendum, illiteratis
fabtblis terreretur</hi></foreign>: "lest the hours which he was
obliged to spend on horseback should be tattled
away without regard to literature."
</p>

<p>An Italian philosopher expressed in his motto,
that <hi rend="italic">time was his estate</hi>; an estate, indeed, which
will produce nothing without cultivation, but will
always abundantly repay the labours of industry,
and satisfy the most extensive desires, if no part of
it be suffered to lie waste by negligence, to be overrun
with noxious plants, or laid out for shew, rather
than for use.

TO THE RAMBLER<lb/>
<salute>SIR,
</salute>

</opener>

<p>THOUGH you seem to have taken a view sufficiently
extensive of the miseries of life, and
have employed much of your speculation on mourn-
<pb n="334"/>

ful subjects, you have not yet exhausted the whole
stock of human infelicity.  There is still a species
of wretchedness which escapes your observation,
though it might supply you with many sage remarks,
and salutary cautions.
</p>

<p>I cannot but imagine the start of attention awakened
by this welcome hint; and at this instant see
the Rambler snuffing his candle, rubbing his spectacles,
stirring his fire, locking out interruption, and
settling himself in his easy chair, that he may enjoy
a new calamity without disturbance.  For, whether
it be that continued sickness or misfortune has acquainted
you only with the bitterness of being; or
that you imagine none but yourself able to discover
what I suppose has been seen and felt by all the
inhabitants of the world; whether you intend your
writings as antidotal to the levity and merriment
with which your rivals endeavour to attract the
favour of the publick; or fancy that you have some
particular powers of dolorous declamation, and
<hi rend="italic">warble out your groans</hi> with uncommon elegance or
energy; it is certain, that whatever be your subject,
melancholy for the most part bursts in upon your
speculation, your gaiety is quickly overcast, and
though your readers may be flattered with hopes of
pleasantry, they are seldom dismissed but with
heavy hearts.
</p>

<p>That I may therefore gratify you with an imitation
of your own syllables of sadness, I will inform
you that I was condemned by some disastrous influence
to be an only son, born to the apparent

<pb n="335"/>

prospect of a large fortune, and allotted to my
parents at that time of life when satiety of common
diversions allows the mind to indulge parental affection
with greater intenseness.  My birth was celebrated
by the tenants with feasts, and dances, and
bagpipes: congratulations were sent from every
family within ten miles round; and my parents
discovered in my first cries such tokens of future
virtue and understanding, that they declared themselves
determined to devote the remaining part
of life to my happiness and the increase of their
estate.
</p>

<p>The abilities of my father and mother were not
perceptibly unequal, and education had given neither
much advantage over the other.  They had both
kept good company, rattled in chariots, glittered
in playhouses, and danced at court, and were
both expert in the games that were in their time
called in as auxiliaries against the intrusion of
thought.
</p>

<p>When there is such a parity between two persons
associated for life, the dejection which the
husband, if he be not completely stupid, must always
suffer for want of superiority, sinks him to
submissiveness.  My mamma therefore governed the
family without controul; and except that my
father still retained some authority in the stables,
and, now and then, after a supernumerary bottle,
broke a looking-glass or china dish to prove his
sovereignty, the whole course of the year was regulated
by her direction, the servants received from

<pb n="336"/>

her all their orders, and the tenants were continued
or dismissed at her discretion.
</p>

<p>She therefore thought herself entitled to the
superintendence of her son's education; and when
my father, at the instigation of the parson, faintly
proposed that I should be sent to school, very
positively told him, that she should not suffer so
fine a child to be ruined; that she never knew any
boys at a grammar-school that could come into a
room without blushing, or sit at table without
some awkward uneasiness; that they were always
putting themselves into danger by boisterous plays,
or vitiating their behaviour with mean company,
and that, for her part, she would rather follow me
to the grave, than see me tear my clothes, and hang
down my head, and sneak about with dirty shoes
and blotted fingers, my hair unpowdered, and my
hat uncocked.
</p>

<p>My father, who had no other end in his proposal
than to appear wise and manly, soon acquiesced,
since I was not to live by my learning; for indeed
he had known very few students that had not some
stiffness in their manner.  They therefore agreed,
that a domestick tutor should be procured, and hired
an honest gentleman of mean conversation and narrow
sentiments, but whom, having passed the common
forms of literary education, they implicitly
concluded qualified to teach all that was to be learned
from a scholar.  He thought himself sufficiently exalted
by being placed at the same table with his
pupil, and had no other view than to perpetuate his

<pb n="337"/>

felicity to the utmost flexibility of submission to all
my mother's opinions and caprices.  He frequently
took away my book, lest I should mope with too
much application, charged me never to write without
turning up my ruffles, and generally brushed
my coat before he dismissed me into the parlour.
</p>

<p>He had no occasion to complain of too burdensome
an employment: for my mother very judiciously
considered, that I was not likely to grow
politer in his company, and suffered me not to pass
any more time in his apartment than my lesson required.
When I was summoned to my task, she
enjoined me not to get any of my tutor's ways,
who was seldom mentioned before me but for practices
to be avoided.  I was every moment admonished
not to lean on my chair, cross my legs, or swing my
hands like my tutor; and once my mother very
seriously deliberated upon his total dismission,
because I began, she said, to learn his manner of
sticking on my hat, and had his bend in my shoulders,
and his totter in my gait.
</p>

<p>Such, however, was her care, that I escaped all
these depravities; and when I was only twelve
years old, had rid myself of every appearance of
childish diffidence.  I was celebrated round the
country for the petulance of my remarks, and
the quickness of my replies; and many a scholar,
five years older than myself, have I dashed into
confusion by the steadiness of my countenance,
silenced by my readiness of repartee, and tortured
with envy by the address with which I picked up

<pb n="338"/>

a fan, presented a snuff-box, or received an empty
tea-cup.
</p>

<p>At fourteen I was completely skilled in all the
niceties of dress, and I could not only enumerate
all the variety of silks, and distinguish the product
of a French loom, but dart my eye through a
numerous company, and observe every deviation
from the reigning mode.  I was universally skilful
in all the changes of expensive finery; but as every
one, they say, has something to which he is particularly
born, was eminently knowing in Brussels
lace.
</p>

<p>The next year saw me advanced to the trust and
power of adjusting the ceremonial of an assembly.
All received their partners from my hand, and
to me every stranger applied for introduction.
My heart now disdained the instructions of a tutor,
who was rewarded with a small annuity for life,
and left me qualified, in my own opinion, to govern
myself.
</p>

<p>In a short time I came to London, and as my
father was well known among the higher classes of
life, soon obtained admission to the most splendid
assemblies and most crowded card-tables.  Here I
found myself universally caressed and applauded;
the ladies praised the fancy of my clothes, the
beauty of my form, and the softness of my voice;
endeavoured in every place to force themselves to
my notice; and invited, by a thousand oblique
solicitations, my attendance to the playhouse, and
my salutations in the park.  I was now happy to

<pb n="339"/>

the utmost extent of my conception; I passed
every morning in dress, every afternoon in visits,
and every night in some select assemblies, where
neither care nor knowledge were suffered to
molest us.
</p>

<p>After a few years, however, these delights became
familiar, and I had leisure to look round me with
more attention.  I then found that my flatterers had
very little power to relieve the languor of satiety,
or recreate weariness, by varied amusement; and
therefore endeavoured to enlarge the sphere of my
pleasures, and to try what satisfaction might be
found in the society of men.  I will not deny the
mortification with which I perceived, that every
man whose name I had heard mentioned with respect,
received me with a kind of tenderness, nearly
bordering on compassion; and that those whose
reputation was not well established, thought it
necessary to justify their understandings, by treating
me with contempt.  One of these witlings
elevated his crest, by asking me in a full coffee-house
the price of patches; and another whispered that he
wondered why Miss Frisk did not keep me that
afternoon to watch her squirrel.
</p>

<p>When I found myself thus hunted from all masculine
conversation by those who were themselves
barely admitted, I returned to the ladies, and resolved
to dedicate my life to their service and their
pleasure.  But I find that I have now lost my charms.
Of those with whom I entered the gay world, some
are married, some have retired, and some have so

<pb n="340"/>

much changed their opinion, that they scarcely pay
any regard to my civilities, if there is any other man
in the place.  The new flight of beauties to whom I
have made my addresses, suffer me to pay the treat,
and then titter with boys.  So that I now find myself
welcome only to a few grave ladies, who, unacquainted
with all that gives either use or dignity
to life, are content to pass their hours between their
bed and their cards, without esteem from the old,
or reverence from the young.
</p>

<p>I cannot but think, Mr. Rambler, that I have
reason to complain; for surely the females ought to
pay some regard to the age of him whose youth was
passed in endeavours to please them.  They that encourage
folly in the boy, have no right to punish it
in the man.  Yet I find that, though they lavish their
first fondness upon pertness and gaiety, they soon
transfer their regard to other qualities, and ungratefully
abandon their adorers to dream out their last
years in stupidity and contempt.

<l> Gladly the joys of present life we miss:</l>

<byline>F.  LEWIS.
</byline>
</lg>
</epigraph>

<p>THAT to please the Lord and Father of the
universe, is the supreme interest of created and
dependent beings, as it is easily proved, has been
universally confessed; and since all rational agents
are conscious of having neglected or violated the
duties prescribed to them, the fear of being rejected,
or punished by God, has always burdened the human
mind.  The expiation of crimes, and renovation of
the forfeited hopes of divine favour, therefore constitute
a large part of every religion.
</p>

<p>The various methods of propitiation and atonement
which fear and folly have dictated, or artifice
and interest tolerated in the different parts of the
world, however they may sometimes reproach or
degrade humanity, at least shew the general consent
of all ages and nations in their opinion of the placability
of the divine nature.  That God will forgive,
may, indeed, be established as the first and fundamental
truth of religion; for, though the knowledge
of his existence is the origin of philosophy, yet,

<pb n="342"/>

without the belief of his mercy, it would have little
influence upon our moral conduct.  There could be
no prospect of enjoying the protection or regard of
him, whom the least deviation from rectitude made
inexorable for ever; and every man would naturally
withdraw his thoughts from the contemplation of
a Creator, whom he must consider as a governor too
pure to be pleased, and too severe to be pacified; as
an enemy infinitely wise, and infinitely powerful,
whom he could neither deceive, escape, nor resist.
</p>

<p>Where there is no hope, there can be no endeavour.
A constant and unfailing obedience is above
the reach of terrestrial diligence; and therefore the
progress of life could only have been the natural
descent of negligent despair from crime to crime,
had not the universal persuasion of forgiveness, to
be obtained by proper means of reconciliation,
recalled those to the paths of virtue, whom their
passions had solicited aside; and animated to new
attempts, and firmer perseverance, those whom
difficulty had discouraged, or negligence surprised.
</p>

<p>In times and regions so disjoined from each other,
that there can scarcely be imagined any communication
of sentiments either by commerce or tradition,
has prevailed a general and uniform expectation of
propitiating God by corporal austerities, of anticipating
his vengeance by voluntary inflictions, and
appeasing his justice by a speedy and cheerful
submission to a less penalty, when a greater is
incurred.
</p>

<p>Incorporated minds will always feel some incli-
<pb n="343"/>

nation towards exterior acts and ritual observances.
Ideas not represented by sensible objects are fleeting,
variable, and evanescent.  We are not able to
judge of the degree of conviction which operated at
any particular time upon our own thoughts, but as
it is recorded by some certain and definite effect.
He that reviews his life in order to determine the
probability of his acceptance with God, if he could
once establish the necessary proportion between
crimes and sufferings, might securely rest upon his
performance of the expiation; but while safety
remains the reward only of mental purity, he is always
afraid lest he should decide too soon in his own
favour; lest he should not have felt the pangs of
true contrition; lest he should mistake satiety for
detestation, or imagine that his passions are subdued
when they are only sleeping.
</p>

<p>From this natural and reasonable diffidence arose,
in humble and timorous piety, a disposition to
confound penance with repentance, to repose on human
determinations, and to receive from some judicial
sentence the stated and regular assignment of
reconciliatory pain.  We are never willing to be without
resource: we seek in the knowledge of others a
succour for our own ignorance, and are ready to
trust any that will undertake to direct us when we
have no confidence in ourselves.
</p>

<p>This desire to ascertain by some outward marks
the state of the soul, and this willingness to calm
the conscience by some settled method, have produced,
as they are diversified in their effects by

<pb n="344"/>

various tempers and principles, most of the disquisitions
and rules, the doubts and solutions, that
have embarrassed the doctrine of repentance, and
perplexed tender and flexible minds with innumerable
scruples concerning the necessary measures of
sorrow, and adequate degrees of self-abhorrence;
and these rules, corrupted by fraud, or debased by
credulity, have, by the common resiliency of the
mind from one extreme to another, incited others
to an open contempt of all subsidiary ordinances,
all prudential caution, and the whole discipline of
regulated piety.
</p>

<p>Repentance, however difficult to be practised, is,
if it be explained without superstition, easily
understood. <hi rend="italic">Repentance is the relinquishment of any
practice, from the conviction that it has offended God</hi>.
Sorrow and fear, and anxiety, are properly not parts,
but adjuncts of repentance; yet they are too closely
connected with it to be easily separated; for they
not only mark its sincerity, but promote its efficacy.
          No man commits any act of negligence or
obstinacy, by which his safety or happiness in this
world is endangered, without feeling the pungency
of remorse.  He who is fully convinced, that he
suffers by his own failure, can never forbear to trace
back his miscarriage to its first cause, to image to
himself a contrary behaviour, and to form involuntary
resolutions against the like fault, even when he
knows that he shall never again have the power of
committing it.  Danger, considered as imminent,
naturally produces such trepidations of impatience

<pb n="345"/>

as leave all human means of safety behind them:
he that has once caught an alarm of terrour, is every
moment seized with useless anxieties, adding one
security to another, trembling with sudden doubts,
and distracted by the perpetual occurrence of new
expedients.  If, therefore, he whose crimes have deprived
him of the favour of God, can reflect upon
his conduct without disturbance, or can at will
banish the reflection; if he who considers himself
as suspended over the abyss of eternal perdition
only by the thread of life, which must soon part by
its own weakness, and which the wing of every
minute may divide, can cast his eyes round him
without shuddering with horrour, or panting with
security; what can he judge of himself, but that he
is not yet awakened to sufficient conviction, since
every loss is more lamented than the loss of the
divine favour, and every danger more dreadful than
the danger of final condemnation?
</p>

<p>Retirement from the cares and pleasures of the
world has been often recommended as useful to repentance.
This at least is evident, that every one
retires, whenever ratiocination and recollection
are required on other occasions; and surely the
retrospect of life, the disentanglement of actions
complicated with innumerable circumstances, and
diffused in various relations, the discovery of the
primary movements of the heart, and the extirpation
of lusts and appetites deeply rooted and widely
spread, may be allowed to demand some secession
from sport and noise, business and folly.  Some sus-
<pb n="346"/>

pension of common affairs, some pause of temporal
pain and pleasure, is doubtless necessary to him that
deliberates for eternity, who is forming the only
plan in which miscarriage cannot be repaired, and
examining the only question in which mistake cannot
be rectified.
</p>

<p>Austerities and mortifications are means by which
the mind is invigorated and roused, by which the
attractions of pleasure are interrupted, and the
chains of sensuality are broken.  It is observed by
one of the fathers, that <hi rend="italic">he who restrains himself in
the use of things lawful, will never encroach upon
things forbidden</hi>.  Abstinence, if nothing more, is, at
least, a cautious retreat from the utmost verge of
permission, and confers that security which cannot
be reasonably hoped by him that dares always to
hover over the precipice of destruction, or delights
to approach the pleasures which he knows it fatal
to partake.  Austerity is the proper antidote to indulgence;
the diseases of mind as well as body are
cured by contraries, and to contraries we should
readily have recourse, if we dreaded guilt as we
dread pain.
</p>

<p>The completion and sum of repentance is a change
of life.  That sorrow which dictates no caution, that
fear which does not quicken our escape, that austerity
which fails to rectify our affections, are vain and
unavailing.  But sorrow and terrour must naturally
precede reformation; for what other cause can produce
it? He, therefore, that feels himself alarmed by
his conscience, anxious for the attainment of a bet-
<pb n="347"/>

ter state, and afflicted by the memory of his past
faults, may justly conclude, that the great work of
repentance is begun, and hope by retirement and
prayer, the natural and religious means of strengthening
his conviction, to impress upon his mind such
a sense of the divine presence, as may overpower
the blandishments of secular delights, and enable
him to advance from one degree of holiness to
another, till death shall set him free from doubt and
contest, misery and temptation<ref target="JohRamb.15">[f]</ref>.

<p>Disaster always waits on early wit.
</p>

</epigraph>

<p>IT has been observed, by long experience, that late
springs produce the greatest plenty.  The delay
of blooms and fragrance, of verdure and breezes, is
for the most part liberally recompensed by the exuberance
and fecundity of the ensuing seasons; the
blossoms which lie concealed till the year is advanced,

<pb n="348"/>

and the sun is high, escape those chilling
blasts, and nocturnal frosts, which are often fatal to
early luxuriance, prey upon the first smiles of vernal
beauty, destroy the feeble principles of vegetable
life, intercept the fruit in the gem, and beat down
the flowers unopened to the ground.
</p>

<p>I am afraid there is little hope of persuading the
young and sprightly part of my readers, upon whom
the spring naturally forces my attention, to learn,
from the great process of nature, the difference between
diligence and hurry, between speed and precipitation;
to prosecute their designs with calmness,
to watch the concurrence of opportunity, and endeavour
to find the lucky moment which they cannot
make.  Youth is the time of enterprize and hope:
having yet no occasion of comparing our force with
any opposing power, we naturally form presumptions
in our own favour, and imagine that obstruction
and impediment will give way before us.  The first
repulses rather inflame vehemence than teach prudence;
a brave and generous mind is long before it
suspects its own weakness, or submits to sap the
difficulties which it expected to subdue by storm.
Before disappointments have enforced the dictates
of philosophy, we believe it in our power to shorten
the interval between the first cause and the last
effect; we laugh at the timorous delays of plodding
industry, and fancy that, by increasing the fire, we
can at pleasure accelerate the projection.
</p>

<p>At our entrance into the world, when health and
vigour give us fair promises of time sufflcient for

<pb n="349"/>

the regular maturation of our schemes, and a long
enjoyment of our acquisitions, we are eager to seize
the present moment; we pluck every gratification
within our reach, without suffering it to ripen into
perfection, and crowd all the varieties of delight
into a narrow compass; but age seldom fails to
change our conduct; we grow negligent of time in
proportion as we have less remaining, and suffer the
last part of life to steal from us in languid preparations
for future undertakings, or slow approaches to
remote advantages, in weak hopes of some fortuitous
occurrence, or drowsy equilibrations of undetermined
counsel: whether it be that the aged, having
tasted the pleasures of man's condition, and found
them delusive, become less anxious for their attainment;
or that frequent miscarriages have depressed
them to despair, and frozen them to inactivity;
or that death shocks them more as it advances
upon them, and they are afraid to remind themselves
of their decay, or to discover to their own
hearts that the time of trifling is past.
</p>

<p>A perpetual conflict with natural desires seems
to be the lot of our present state.  In youth we require
something of the tardiness and frigidity of
age; and in age we must labour to recall the fire and
impetuosity of youth; in youth we must learn to
expect, and in age to enjoy.
</p>

<p>The torment of expectation is, indeed, not easily
to be borne at a time when every idea of gratification
fires the blood, and flashes on the fancy; when
the heart is vacant to every fresh form of delight,

<pb n="350"/>

and has no rival engagements to withdraw it from
the importunities of a new desire.  Yet, since the
fear of missing what we seek must always be proportionable
to the happiness expected from possessing
it, the passions, even in this tempestuous state,
might be somewhat moderated by frequent inculcation
of the mischief of temerity, and the hazard
of losing that which we endeavour to seize before
our time.
</p>

<p>He that too early aspires to honours, must resolve
to encounter not only the opposition of interest,
but the malignity of envy.  He that is too eager to
be rich, generally endangers his fortune in wild
adventures, and uncertain projects; and he that
hastens too speedily to reputation, often raises his
character by artifices and fallacies, decks himself in
colours which quickly fade, or in plumes which
accident may shake off, or competition pluck away.
</p>

<p>The danger of early eminence has been extended
by some, even to the gifts of nature; and an opinion
has been long conceived, that quickness of invention,
accuracy of judgment, or extent of knowledge,
appearing before the usual time, presage a short
life.  Even those who are less inclined to form general
conclusions, from instances which by their own
nature must be rare, have yet been inclined to prognosticate
no suitable progress from the first sallies
of rapid wits; but have observed, that after a short
effort they either loiter or faint, and suffer themselves
to be surpassed by the even and regular
perseverance of slower understandings.

<pb n="351"/>

</p>

<p>It frequently happens, that applause abates diligence.
Whoever finds himself to have performed
more than was demanded, will be contented to
spare the labour of unnecessary performances, and
sit down to enjoy at ease his superfluities of honour.
He whom success has made confident of his abilities,
quickly claims the privilege of negligence, and
looks contemptuously on the gradual advances of a
rival, whom he imagines himself able to leave behind
whenever he shall again summon his force to
the contest.  But long intervals of pleasure dissipate
attention, and weaken constancy; nor is it easy for
him that has sunk from diligence into sloth, to
rouse out of his lethargy, to recollect his notions,
rekindle his curiosity, and engage with his former
ardour in the toils of study.
</p>

<p>Even that friendship which intends the reward of
genius, too often tends to obstruct it.  The pleasure
of being caressed, distinguished, and admired, easily
seduces the student from literary solitude.  He is
ready to follow the call which summons him to
hear his own praise, and which, perhaps, at once
flatters his appetite with certainty of pleasures, and
his ambition with hopes of patronage; pleasures
which he conceives inexhaustible, and hopes which
he has not yet learned to distrust.
</p>

<p>These evils, indeed, are by no means to be imputed
to nature, or considered as inseparable from
an early display of uncommon abilities.  They may
be certainly escaped by prudence and resolution,
and must therefore be recounted rather as consola-
<pb n="352"/>

tions to those who are less liberally endowed, than
as discouragements to such as are born with uncommon
qualities.  Beauty is well known to draw
after it the persecutions of impertinence, to incite
the artifices of envy, and to raise the flames of unlawful
love; yet, among the ladies whom prudence
or modesty have made most eminent, who has ever
complained of the inconveniences of an amiable
form? or would have purchased safety by the loss
of charms?
</p>

<p>Neither grace of person, nor vigour of understanding,
are to be regarded otherwise than as
blessings, as means of happiness indulged by the
Supreme Benefactor; but the advantages of either
may be lost by too much eagerness to obtain them.
A thousand beauties in their first blossom, by an
imprudent exposure to the open world, have suddenly
withered at the blast of infamy; and men who
might have subjected new regions to the empire
of learning, have been lured by the praise of their
first productions from academical retirement, and
wasted their days in vice and dependance.  The virgin
who too soon aspires to celebrity and conquest,
perishes by childish vanity, ignorant credulity, or
guiltless indiscretion.  The genius who catches at
laurels and preferment before his time, mocks the
hopes that he had excited, and loses those years
which might have been most usefully employed,
the years of youth, of spirit, and vivacity.
</p>

<p>It is one of the innumerable absurdities of pride,
that we are never more impatient of direction, than

<pb n="353"/>

in that part of life when we need it most; we are in
haste to meet enemies whom we have not strength
to overcome, and to undertake tasks which we cannot
perform: and as he that once miscarries does
not easily persuade mankind to favour another attempt,
an ineffectual struggle for fame is often followed
by perpetual obscurity.

</epigraph>

<p>WE are taught by Celsus, that health is best
preserved by avoiding settled habits of life,
and deviating sometimes into slight aberrations
from the laws of medicine; by varying the proportions
of food and exercise, interrupting the successions
of rest and labour, and mingling hardships
with indulgence.  The body, long accustomed to
stated quantities and uniform periods, is disordered
by the smallest irregularity; and since we cannot
adjust every day by the balance or barometer, it is
fit sometimes to depart from rigid accuracy, that
we may be able to comply with necessary affairs, or
strong inclinations.  He that too long observes nice
punctualities, condemns himself to voluntary imbecility,
and will not long escape the miseries of
disease.
</p>

<p>The same laxity of regimen is equally necessary

<pb n="354"/>

to intellectual health, and to a perpetual susceptibility
of occasional pleasure.  Long confinement to
the same company which perhaps similitude of taste
brought first together, quickly contracts the faculties,
and makes a thousand things offensive that are
in themselves indifferent; a man accustomed to hear
only the echo of his own sentiments, soon bars all
the common avenues of delight, and has no part in
the general gratifications of mankind.
</p>

<p>In things which are not immediately subject to
religious or moral consideration, it is dangerous
to be too rigidly in the right.  Sensibility may, by
an incessant attention to elegance and propriety, be
quickened to a tenderness inconsistent with the condition
of humanity, irritable by the smallest asperity,
and vulnerable by the gentlest touch.  He that
pleases himself too much with minute exactness,
and submits to endure nothing in accommodations,
attendance, or address, below the point of perfection,
will, whenever he enters the crowd of life, be
harassed with innumerable distresses, from which
those who have not in the same manner increased
their sensations find no disturbance.  His exotick
softness will shrink at the coarseness of vulgar felicity,
like a plant transplanted to northern nurseries,
from the dews and sunshine of the tropical regions.
</p>

<p>There will always be a wide interval between
practical and ideal excellence; and, therefore, if we
allow not ourselves to be satisfied while we can perceive
any errour or defect, we must refer our hopes
of ease to some other period of existence.  It is well

<pb n="355"/>

known, that, exposed to a microscope, the smoothest
polish of the most solid bodies discovers cavities
and prominences; and that the softest bloom of
roseate virginity repels the eye with excrescences
and discolorations.  The perceptions as well as the
senses may be improved to our own disquiet, and
we may, by diligent cultivation of the powers of
dislike, raise in time an artificial fastidiousness,
which shall fill the imagination with phantoms of
turpitude, shew us the naked skeleton of every
delight, and present us only with the pains of
pleasure, and the deformities of beauty.
</p>

<p>Peevishness, indeed, would perhaps very little
disturb the peace of mankind, were it always the
consequence of superfluous delicacy; for it is the
privilege only of deep reflection, or lively fancy, to
destroy happiness by art and refinement.  But by
continual indulgence of a particular humour, or by
long enjoyment of undisputed superiority, the dull
and thoughtless may likewise acquire the power of
tormenting themselves and others, and become
sufficiently ridiculous or hateful to those who are
within sight of their conduct, or reach of their
influence.
</p>

<p>They that have grown old in a single state are
generally found to be morose, fretful, and captious;
tenacious of their own practices and maxims; soon
offended by contradiction or negligence; and impatient
of any association, but with those that will
watch their nod, and submit themselves to unlimited
authority.  Such is the effect of having lived without

<pb n="356"/>

the necessity of consulting any inclination but
their own.
</p>

<p>The irascibility of this class of tyrants is generally
exerted upon petty provocations, such as are incident
to understandings not far extended beyond
the instincts of animal life; but, unhappily, he that
fixes his attention on things always before him, will
never have long cessations of anger.  There are many
veterans of luxury upon whom every noon brings a
paroxysm of violence, fury, and execration; they
never sit down to their dinner without finding the
meat so injudiciously bought, or so unskilfully
dressed, such blunders in the seasoning, or such
improprieties in the sauce, as can scarcely be expiated
without blood; and, in the transports of resentment,
make very little distinction between guilt and innocence,
but let fly their menaces, or growl out their
discontent, upon all whom fortune exposes to the
storm.
</p>

<p>It is not easy to imagine a more unhappy condition
than that of dependance on a peevish man.
In every other state of inferiority the certainty of
pleasing is perpetually increased by a fuller knowledge
of our duty; and kindness and confidence are
strenghtened by every new act of trust, and proof
of fidelity.  But peevishness sacrifices to a momentary
offence the obsequiousness or usefulness of half
a life, and, as more is performed, increases her
exactions.

<p>Chrysalus gained a fortune by trade, and retired
into the country; and, having a brother burthened

<pb n="357"/>

by the number of his children, adopted one of his
sons.  The boy was dismissed with many prudent
admonitions; informed of his father's inability to
maintain him in his native rank; cautioned against
all opposition to the opinions or precepts of his uncle;
and animated to perseverance by the hopes of supporting
the honour of the family, and overtopping
his elder brother.  He had a natural ductility of mind,
without much warmth of affection, or elevation of
sentiment; and therefore readily complied with
every variety of caprice; patiently endured contradictory
reproofs; heard false accusations without
pain, and opprobrious reproaches without reply;
laughed obstreperously at the ninetieth repetition
of a joke; asked questions about the universal decay
of trade; admired the strength of those heads by
which the price of stocks is changed and adjusted;
and behaved with such prudence and circumspection,
that after six years the will was made, and Juvenculus
was declared heir.  But unhappily, a month
afterwards, retiring at night from his uncle's chamber,
he left the door open behind him: the old man
tore his will, and being then perceptibly declining,
for want of time to deliberate, left his money to a
trading company.

<p>When female minds are embittered by age or
solitude, their malignity is generally exerted in a
rigorous and spiteful superintendence of domestic
trifles.  Eriphile has employed her eloquence for
twenty years upon the degeneracy of servants, the
nastiness of her house, the ruin of her furniture, the

<pb n="358"/>

difficulty of preserving tapestry from the moths,
and the carelessness of the sluts whom she employs
in brushing it.  It is her business every morning to
visit all the rooms, in hopes of finding a chair without
its cover, a window shut or open contrary to
her orders, a spot on the hearth, or a feather on the
floor, that the rest of the day may be justifiably
spent in taunts of contempt, and vociferations of
anger.  She lives for no other purpose but to preserve
the neatness of a house and gardens, and feels
neither inclination to pleasure, nor aspiration after
virtue, while she is engrossed by the great employment
of keeping gravel from grass, and wainscot
from dust.  Of three amiable nieces she has declared
herself an irreconcileable enemy, to one, because
she broke off a tulip with her hoop; to another, because
she spilt her coffee on a Turkey carpet; and
to the third, because she let a wet dog run into the
parlour.  She has broken off her intercourse of visits,
because company makes a house dirty; and resolves
to confine herself more to her own affairs, and to
live no longer in mire by foolish lenity.

<p>Peevishness is generally the vice of narrow minds,
and, except when it is the effect of anguish and disease,
by which the resolution is broken, and the
mind made too feeble to bear the lightest addition
to its miseries, proceeds from an unreasonable persuasion
of the importance of trifles.  The proper
remedy against it is, to consider the dignity of
human nature, and the folly of suffering perturbation
and uneasiness from causes unworthy of our notice.

<p>He that resigns his peace to little casualties, and
suffers the course of his life to be interrupted by
fortuitous inadvertencies, or offences, delivers up
himself to the direction of the wind, and loses all
that constancy and equanimity which constitute
the chief praise of a wise man.
</p>

<p>The province of prudence lies between the greatest
things and the least; some surpass our power by
their magnitude, and some escape our notice by
their number and their frequency.  But the indispensable
business of life will afford sufficient exercise
to every understanding; and such is the
limitation of the human powers, that by attention
to trifles we must let things of importance pass
unobserved: when we examine a mite with a glass,
we see nothing but a mite.
</p>

<p>That it is every man's interest to be pleased, will
need little proof: that it is his interest to please
others, experience will inform him.  It is therefore
not less necessary to happiness than to virtue, that
he rid his mind of passions which make him uneasy
to himself, and hateful to the world, which enchain
his intellects, and obstruct his improvement.
