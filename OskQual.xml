Oskison, John M.  "'The Quality of Mercy': A Story of the Indian
Territory."  <hi rend="italic">Century Magazine</hi> 68 (June 1904): 178-81.
</head>

<p>MISS VENITA CHURCHFIELD took up eagerly the fresh, neatly folded
copy of the "Sachem" which a small half-breed Indian boy, with the
singular little war-whoop that invariably announced his weekly
delivery, had just thrown across the picket-fence.  Going indoors,
she smiled at the three columns of cattle-brands displayed on
splotchy black cuts of steers, and was irritated anew that Efferts,
the editor, should continue to print them.  They occupied a
considerable share of the four pages devoted to keeping the little
prairie town of Black Oak informed of the world's doings in and
outside of that small corner of the Indian Territory.
</p><p>In spite of the editor's declaration that cattle had made
Black Oak, and that the importance of spreading the knowledge of a
brand throughout the country was great, the girl thought the
"branding-iron page" distastefully provincial.  Fresh from a St.
Louis school, she had hoped, two years before, on meeting the
editor, that he would be a valuable ally in the work of introducing
culture &mdash; an exceedingly vague something, meant, for one thing, to
suppress the unseemly shooting at sign-boards when, on occasion,
cow-boys, full-bloods, half-breeds, and whites came in at night to
"paint the town."  But the editor had preferred to laugh <hi rend="italic">with</hi>
those who made the place incongruous rather than <hi rend="italic">at</hi> them.  The
cattle-brands held the front page, and "Missouri Bob," the outlaw,
continued to fill space as one of Indian Territory's important men.
</p><p>"I could write editorials on Ruskin and national politics, and
cut out the ugly raw news," Efferts had said once; "but nobody
would read the paper.  Cattle made Black Oak, and they made the
'Sachem,' too."
</p><p>Miss Churchfield opened the paper at the third, or "local,"
page.  A heading caught her eye, and she began to read:

</p><p>"Missouri Bob" has a rival.  This time it is a man well known
to the country &mdash; Dalton, the Englishman.  Last Monday, about eleven
o'clock, he held up the Hon. C. M. Graybill of Kansas City, who was
on his way to Fourteen Mile Creek to buy a herd of cattle from old
man Bluefeather, the Cherokee.  At the Locust Creek crossing a man
came suddenly out of a patch of wild-plum bushes, and seizing the
horse, covered Mr. Graybill with his gun.
</p><p>There was no chance for the cattle-buyer to resist, the attack
was so unexpected.  Robbed of his arms (a pair of handsome
pistols), a fine plaited bridle, and $10,000 in currency that he
was taking down to pay for Bluefeather's cattle, Mr. Graybill
returned at once to Black Oak and telegraphed the news of his loss
to his employers, the Great Western Beef Co.
</p><p>A full description of the highwayman was furnished to our
marshals, and under the leadership of Heck Bunner a posse was sent
out to try to intercept him before he got to the Grand River hills,
where it is presumed he will be safely hidden by certain characters
more friendly to lawbreakers than to officers of the law.  Bunner
returned to-day (Thursday) without having found a trace of the
robber.
</p><p>How long is this state of affairs to continue?  Every lover of
order should make it his business to hunt out the desperate
characters that
<pb n="179"/>
infest our country; and now that "Missouri
Bob" has a rival in the clever Englishman, who has heretofore borne
a fair reputation in spite of the fact that he has never got on,
the country has become doubly unsafe.

</p><p>So far Venita Churchfield read with a growing astonishment.
She put down the paper with a gasp, then broke out:
</p><p>"Impossible!  Mr. Efferts must be crazy to print that."
</p><p>She hurried to a back room, where her mother, a large, shrewd,
brown-faced quarter-blood, sat sewing.
</p><p>"Mother, let me send for Mr. Efferts to come to supper.  I
must see him."
</p><p>"What's the matter, dear?  Why are you so excited?"
</p><p>"Read this!"
</p><p>Venita thrust the "Sachem" into her mother's hand.  The older
woman moved to the window and read the long account through
carefully, never making a sign, while the girl waited impatiently.
</p><p>"How do you suppose that awful mistake got into the paper?"
The question came explosively.
</p><p>"It may not be a mistake, dear."  Mrs. Churchfield spoke
quietly.
</p><p>"But, mother &mdash; why, we've known Mr. Dalton for years, and
nothing could be further from my thought of him."
</p><p>"Well, dear," said the mother, folding the "Sachem" carefully
as she spoke, "we have known Mr. Dalton a long time, that's true.
He worked for your father in Texas when you were so high."  Mrs.
Churchfield's brown hand went down almost to a level with her
knees.  "I've never known the man to do a downright dishonest
thing; but his family somewhere &mdash; Canada, England, or Australia:
I've never known &mdash; threw him over.  Your father, when he was alive,
could trust him, and I've done the same."
</p><p>Mrs. Churchfield hesitated a moment before going on:
</p><p>"He pulled you out of a bad scrape once about the time we came
up to the Territory.  You don't remember; you were too young.  It
was a matter of getting into a corral ahead of some wild steers,
knocking down your playhouse, and grabbing you up on his horse.
Since that day I've been more tolerant, I think, than I ought with
Mr. Dalton's strange notions."
</p><p>Mrs. Churchfield seemed to speak regretfully.  She did not
tell Venita of the secret alarm she had felt at the growing
friendliness of her daughter for this cow-boy Englishman, this
irresponsible, clever bit of driftwood, who, after all, had served
the Churchfields well until the father died, when he had gone to
work for Colonel Clarke.
</p><p>"Mother," said Venita, in a frightened tone, "Mr. Dalton's
coming to supper!"
</p><p>"Is he?" queried Mrs. Churchfield.  "Venita dear, I'm very,
very sorry for Mr. Dalton.  He shouldn't have come so often."  It
was plain that the mother had seen what the girl had hardly
considered &mdash; that Dalton was deeply in love with Venita.  "However,
it is best to get these two men together now."
</p><p>"But do you think I dare to have them both, after this?"  She
pointed to the newspaper.
</p><p>"Dear, Mr. Efferts isn't afraid; and Mr. Dalton isn't going to
shoot him.  Go on, and send Sammy with your note to Mr. Efferts."
</p><p>After the chore-boy, a young Cherokee wearing a broad,
umbrella-like black hat shoved far down over his ears, had
clattered away on a gray pony to the "Sachem" office, Venita took
up the paper once more.  There was more about Dalton: his history,
as far as it was known to the country, was detailed from the time
he began to punch cattle for Colonel Clarke to his disappearance
from Black Oak in 1890.  His reappearance a year later &mdash; a month
before the robbery of the cattle-buyer &mdash; was spoken of as
mysterious, and his actions of late as suspicious.
</p><p>Efferts gladly accepted the invitation from Venita
Churchfield.  She met him at the door, a well-gowned, tall, rounded
girl of twenty, with a dark face and live black eyes.  Before going
in from the hall she whispered in some agitation:
</p><p>"Our other guest came in just ahead of you &mdash; don't seem
surprised."  She led the way to the parlor, and before Efferts had
time to hesitate was saying: "I believe you know Mr. Efferts, Mr.
Dalton."
</p><p>A tall man, his face bronzed and his light mustache sun-bleached, rose, shifting the opened "Sachem" from his right to his
left hand, and came forward to greet Efferts gravely.  The editor
shook the other's proffered hand, and stepping back, stared
frankly.  Dalton turned to speak to the girl, dropping the paper on
a convenient chair.
<pb n="180"/>
</p><p>For Efferts it was a bewildering moment.  Fresh from the
press, his words of accusation and denunciation of Dalton stared at
him from the newspaper.  By every law of probability Dalton should
be hiding in the flint-hills of Grand River instead of standing
here talking coolly to Miss Churchfield within a block of Marshal
Bunner's house.
</p><p>Venita's mother came in to say that supper was waiting.  In
the girl's appealing glance as she led the way to the dining-room
both men read the demand for a truce, and the "Sachem" story was
not referred to.  For an hour Efferts puzzled his brain over the
mystery.  He was a straightforward, practical sort of man, not
given to psychological inquiry.  He liked Venita Churchfield, and
had hoped that he might some day &mdash;   But so had a dozen others, and
it was no strange thing to see a man flash out with unexpected
brilliance in the girl's presence.  Certainly the tall, reserved
man Dalton, of whom little more was known than that he undoubtedly
was English and self-contained, was showing a rare tact and grace
in meeting a situation that to Efferts was frankly puzzling.
Venita warmed under the fire of the sun-tanned cow-boy's talk; a
faint red surged up to overwhelm the rich darkness of her cheeks.
</p><p>Going out to the parlor after supper, Dalton whispered to the
girl, who beckoned her mother aside.  "An executive session, mama,"
she said.
</p><p>Alone with the two men, Venita stared in some dismay at the
editor's uncompromising, grave face and Dalton's half-humorous,
silent one.  Suddenly she came between them, seizing an arm of
each, and cried out:
</p><p>"Say something, you men &mdash; do something, or I shall go mad!"
</p><p>Dalton laughed, and Efferts, at the touch, felt the blood
surge through his veins, a sensation he had thought impossible to
a plodding, worldly country editor of thirty-eight.
</p><p>"What shall we say?" began Dalton, smiling a trifle nervously.
</p><p>"Say!" echoed Venita.  She took up the crumpled "Sachem" from
the chair and held it before her.  "Tell me," she went on, "how
this horrible mistake got into the paper."  She turned to the
editor.  "Tell me that, Mr. Efferts!"
</p><p>"Why," Efferts began lamely and conventionally, "I'm sure I
don't quite understand.  I can only quote the 'Sachem's' motto, 'If
it's in the "Sachem," the brand's registered.'  Perhaps Mr. Dalton &mdash;"
</p><p>Then the Englishman broke in:
</p><p>"I suppose I ought to shoot Efferts where he stands, bind you,
Miss Churchfield, to a chair, and shut your mother in the cellar,
to bear out the reputation I've acquired.  But I'm just going to
say that the 'Sachem' was quite correct in its account of the
affair at Locust Creek.  The only thing omitted was something that
Efferts couldn't have known about.  It was a personal matter, and
doesn't affect my standing in the eyes of the law &mdash; or in the
judgment of the 'Sachem.'  I supposed you'd have the tale from
Graybill," &mdash; Dalton turned to speak directly to the editor, &mdash; "but,
you see, one can ride safely enough into town in the dusk when
everybody thinks you a hundred miles away."  He spoke lightly.  "My
invitation to supper came to me over there," &mdash; he motioned toward
the east, where rose the Grand River hills, &mdash; "and of course I
came" &mdash; he stepped nearer to Efferts and repeated for his ear,
tensely &mdash; "and of course I came."
</p><p>Efferts knew then, in a flash, Dalton's real story.  He
guessed correctly that the blond Englishman had run away from the
fascination of the girl, and had been drawn back to her by a
poignant memory.  Just why the man had adopted this quixotic course
Efferts could not quite understand; and it is certain that Dalton
would have found it hard to explain the reason back of his robbery
of the cattle-buyer.  It was a wild act, a thing done on the
impulse.  The need for money had seemed peculiarly strong; the
comfort and apparent permanence of the Churchfield home at Black
Oak, and the reality of the thousands back of the girl and her
widowed mother, had baffled him as an unendowed worker with his
hands.
</p><p>Dalton knew it was a twisted point of view, knew that men as
poor as he had aspired and won; but it was an impression he could
not get rid of that ten thousand dollars would make a vast
difference.  He tried to say as much.
</p><p>"I hope you will both believe me when I say that it was a
gamble for a big stake &mdash; bigger than the purse I knew the man had.
I thought that was a possible first step, but it was all wrong.  It
was childish.
<pb n="181"/>
I see it now.  I can't explain it adequately
to both of you.  But I trust you to see the foolish impulse.  I'd
like you to see it, anyway &mdash; you, Miss Churchfield."  He turned away
for a moment with a little gesture, as if brushing away a dream.
</p><p>Dalton touched Efferts on the arm, and the two stepped aside.
The Englishman said:
</p><p>"Of course you see your duty, Efferts; do it as soon as you
like after we leave the house.  But &mdash; but if you do see how
infernally demented I was," &mdash; it was hardly necessary for Dalton to
turn his eyes momentarily toward the girl, waiting nervously by the
piano, &mdash; "and want to do a fellow a generous turn, just wait until
you can get a telegram to Kansas City.  There must be a newspaper
there you can reach at this time of evening.  Ask if the money I
got from Graybill wasn't returned to the Great Western Beef
Company.  I telegraphed it from Southwest City yesterday."
</p><p>"Dalton, are you lying to me?"
</p><p>Efferts looked squarely at the other, but there was no sign of
evasion, only a half-contemptuous, half-amused gleam in his eyes,
as he answered:
</p><p>"You've got to telegraph, and the sooner done the better."
</p><p>"Yes, I've got to telegraph."
</p><p>The chore-boy was sent away again, this time to the railroad
station, with a question to the Kansas City "Arrow."
</p><p>And the prisoner, the judge, and the sympathetic jailer
waited.  Just before ten o'clock the boy returned with the answer.
Efferts read it and passed it to Dalton.  He glanced at the first
half-dozen words and gave the message to Venita Churchfield.  She
read wonderingly:

</p><p>Graybill money returned mysteriously &mdash; $10,000.  Write us
immediately full story.

</p><p>The matter was explained to Venita Churchfield, and again
Dalton drew the editor aside.
</p><p>"I can't ask you to let me off.  I can only say that it will
be a mistake to bear too hard on me.  I'll go out with you &mdash; to
Bunner's, if you like.  It would be foolish to try to play the
daredevil and bolt."
</p><p>To the girl Dalton said, in a voice far from steady: "I wish
I had the courage to tell you what drove me to do this foolish
thing; but of course you don't want to hear it, and I must not tell
you.  You see, I'm still too cowardly to ask for more than your
pity!"  But the avowal was in his eyes, plain, as he held out his
hand.  "Good-by," he whispered, and turned hurriedly to join
Efferts at the door.
</p><p>When the two men left the front door and their footsteps
crunched down the gravel path together, Venita lingered a moment
before shutting them from her sight.
</p><p>Efferts saw how well the Englishman bore off his broken hope,
and Portia's old plea came into his mind.  Aside from the bizarre
appeal to his sense of the romantic, there <hi rend="italic">was</hi> the quality of
mercy to be considered.  At the gate, beside which Dalton's horse
stood tied, head drooping comfortably in the warm spring air,
Efferts turned to ask:
</p><p>"Dalton, if you ride away to-night will you go to Texas?"
</p><p>"I'll catch the midnight train south from Prairie Switch, the
next stop from Black Oak.  I'll telegraph you to-morrow from
Dennison whatever ten words you name."
</p><p>"Suppose we make it four &mdash; 'The quality of mercy.'"
</p><p>Efferts held out his hand.  Dalton mounted with a swing, then
rode near to say:
</p><p>"You'll have the message, old fellow, and you'll find that one
fool has had his lesson &mdash; a costly one."
</p><p>He was gone, the sound of his horse's hoofs fading into the
night.
</p><p>A week later Venita Churchfield read in the "Sachem" this
brief paragraph:

</p><p>The $10,000 taken by Dalton, the Englishman, from the Hon. C.
M. Graybill of Kansas City has been returned to the Great Western
Beef Co.  Dalton is now in Texas, and not likely to win further
laurels in the Territory as a rival of "Missouri Bob."

</p><p>Venita met the editor at the door, the paper in her hand.  She
pointed to the paragraph as he came up the steps.
</p><p>"Yes, it is a brief ending," he said, "to an exciting 'story';
but &mdash; "
</p><p>"I know, dear," the girl whispered, coming up to him and
slipping her hand into his; "but he was more foolish than bad.  It
was right to be generous."
