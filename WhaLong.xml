<p>The shade of those our days that had no tongue.
</p></epigraph> 

 
<p>  IT was last winter, after a twelve years' absence from New 
York, that I saw again, at one of the Jim Cumnors' dinners, my 
old 
friend Halston Merrick.</p><p> 
     The Cumnors' house is one of the few where, even after such 
a 
lapse of time, one can be sure of finding familiar faces and 
picking up old threads; where for a moment one can abandon one's 
self to the illusion that New York humanity is less unstable than 
its bricks and mortar.  And that evening in particular I remember 
feeling that there could be no pleasanter way of re-entering the 
confused and careless world to which I was returning than through 
the quiet, softly-lit dining-room in which Mrs. Cumnor, with a 
characteristic sense of my needing to be broken in gradually, had 
contrived to assemble so many friendly faces.</p><p> 
     I was glad to see them all, including the three or four I 
did 
not know, or failed to recognize, but had no difficulty in 
classing 
as in the tradition and of the group; but I was most of all 
glad&mdash; 
as I rather wonderingly found&mdash;to set eyes again on Halston 
Merrick.</p><p> 
     He and I had been at Harvard together, for one thing, and 
had 
shared there curiosities and ardours a little outside the current 
tendencies: had, on the whole, been freer and less amenable to 
the 
accepted.  Then, for the next few years, Merrick had been a vivid 
and promising figure in young American life.  Handsome, free and 
fine, he had wandered and tasted and compared.  After, leaving 
Harvard he had spent two years at Oxford.  He then accepted a 
private secretaryship to our Ambassador in England, and came back 
from this adventure with a fresh curiosity about public affairs 
at 
home, and the conviction that men of his kind didn't play a large 
enough part in them.  This led, first, to his running for a State 
Senatorship which he failed to get, and ultimately to a few 
months 
of intelligent activity in a municipal office.  Soon after a 
change 
of party had deprived him of this post he published a small 
volume 
of rather hauntingly delicate sonnets, and, a year later, an odd 
uneven brilliant book on Municipal Government.  After that one 
hardly knew where to look for his next appearance; but chance 
rather disappointingly 
 
<pb n="146"/>  
solved the problem by killing off 
his father and placing Halston at the head of the Merrick Iron 
Foundry at Yonkers.</p><p> 
     His friends had gathered that, whenever this regrettable 
contingency should occur, he meant to dispose of the business and 
continue his life of free experiment.  As often happens in such 
cases, however, it was not the moment for a sale, and Merrick had 
to take over the management of the foundry.  Some two years later 
he had a chance to free himself, but when it came he did not 
choose 
to take it.  This tame sequel to an inspiriting start was 
slightly 
disappointing to some of us, and I was among those disposed to 
regret Merrick's drop to the level of the merely prosperous.  
Then 
I went away to my big engineering job in China, and from there to 
Africa, and spent the next twelve years out of sight and sound of 
New York doings.</p><p> 
     During that long interval I learned of no new phase in 
Merrick's evolution, but this did not surprise me, as I had never 
expected from him actions resonant enough to be heard across the 
globe.  All I knew&mdash;and this surprised me&mdash;was that he had never 
married, and that he was still in the iron business.  All through 
those years, however, I never ceased to wish, in certain 
situations 
and at certain turns of thought, that Merrick were in reach, that 
I could tell this or that to Merrick.  I had never, in the 
interval, found any one with just his quickness of perception and 
just his sureness of touch.</p><p> 
     After dinner, therefore, we irresistibly drew together.  In 
Mrs. Cumnor's big easy drawing-room cigars were allowed, and 
there 
was no break in the communion of the sexes; and, this being the 
case, I should have sought a seat beside one of the ladies who so 
indulgently suffered our presence.  But, as generally happened 
when 
Merrick was in sight, I found myself steering straight for him 
past 
all the minor ports of call.</p><p> 
     There had been no time, before our passage to the 
dining-room, 
for more than the barest expression of delight at meeting, and 
our 
seats had been at opposite ends of the longish table, so that we 
got our first real look at each other in the screened secluded 
sofa-corner to which Mrs. Cumnor's vigilance now tactfully 
directed 
us.</p><p> 
     Merrick was still handsome in his long swarthy way: 
handsomer 
perhaps, with thinnish hair and graver lines, than in the young 
excess of his good looks.  He was very glad to see me and 
expressed 
his gladness in terms of the same charming smile; but as soon as 
we 
began to talk I felt a change.  It was not merely the change that 
years and experience and altered values bring.  There was 
something 
more fundamental the matter with Merrick: something dreadful, 
unforeseen, unaccountable.  Merrick had grown conventional and 
dull.</p><p> 
     In the face of his frank pleasure in seeing me I was 
ashamed, 
at first, to analyze the nature of the change; but presently our 
talk began to flag&mdash;fancy a talk with Merrick flagging!&mdash;and 
self-deception became impossible as I watched myself handing out 
platitudes with the unconvinced gesture of a salesman offering 
something 'equally good.'  The worst of it was that Merrick&mdash; 
Merrick, who had once felt everything!&mdash;didn't seem to feel any 
lack of spontaneity in my remarks, but clung to me in speech and 
look with a harrowing faith in the resuscitating power of our 
past.  
It was as if he treasured the empty vessel of our friendship 
without perceiving that the last drop of its essence had gone 
dry.</p><p> 
     I am putting all this in exaggerated terms.  Through my 
surprise and disappointment there glowed a certain sense of well-being in the mere phys-<pb n="147"/> ical presence of my old 
friend.  I 
liked looking at the way his thin dark hair broke away from the 
forehead, at the tautness of his smooth brown cheek, the 
contemplative backward tilt of his head, the way his brown eyes 
mused upon the scene through indolently lowered lids.  All the 
past 
was in his way of looking and sitting, and I wanted to stay near 
him, and knew that he wanted me to stay, but the devil of it was 
that neither of us knew what to talk about.</p><p> 
     It was this difficulty which caused me, after a while, since 
I could not follow Merrick's talk, to follow his eyes in their 
slow 
circuit of the room.</p><p> 
     At the moment when our glances joined, his happened to have 
paused on a lady seated at some distance from our corner.  
Immersed, at first, in the satisfaction of finding myself again 
with Merrick, I had been only negatively aware of this lady, as 
of 
one of the few persons present whom I did not know, or failed to 
remember.  There was nothing in her appearance or attitude to 
challenge my indifference or to excite my curiosity: I don't 
suppose I should have looked at her at all if I had not noticed 
that my friend was doing so.</p><p> 
     She was a woman of about forty-seven, with fair faded hair 
and 
a young figure.  Her smoke-gray dress was handsome but 
ineffective, 
and her pale and rather serious face wore a small unvarying smile 
which might have been pinned on with her ornaments.  She was one 
of 
the women in whom the years show rather what they have taken than 
what they have bestowed, and only on looking closely did one see 
that what they had taken must have been exceptionally good of its 
kind.</p><p> 
     Phil Cumnor and another man were talking to her, and the 
very 
intensity of the attention she bestowed on them betrayed the 
straining of rebellious thoughts.  She never let her eyes stray 
or 
her smile drop; and at the proper moments I saw she was ready 
with 
the proper sentiment.</p><p> 
     The party, like most of those that Mrs. Cumnor gathered 
about 
her, was not composed of exceptional beings.  The people of the 
old 
New York set were not exceptional: they were in fact mostly cut 
on 
the same neat, convenient and unobtrusive pattern; but they were 
often exceedingly 'nice.'  And this obsolete quality marked every 
look and gesture of the lady I was scrutinizing.</p><p> 
     While these reflections were passing through my mind I was 
aware that Merrick's eyes were still turned in the same 
direction.  
I took a cross-section of his look and found in it neither 
surprise 
nor absorption, but only a certain sober pleasure just about at 
the 
emotional level of the rest of the room.  If he were looking at 
the 
lady in question it was only, his expression seemed to say, 
because, all things considered, there were fewer reasons for 
looking at anybody else.</p><p> 
     This made me wonder what were the reasons for looking at <hi rend="italic"> 
her:</hi> and as a first step toward enlightenment I said:&mdash;'I'm 
sure 
I've seen the lady over there in gray&mdash;'</p><p> 
     Merrick, with a slight effort, detached his eyes and turned 
them on me in a wondering look.</p><p> 
     'Seen her?  You know her.'  He paused for my response.  '<hi rend="italic"> 
Don't</hi> you know her?  It's Mrs. Reardon.'</p><p> 
     I wondered that he should wonder, for I could not remember, 
in 
the Cumnor group or elsewhere, having known any one of the name 
he 
mentioned.</p><p> 
     'But perhaps,' he continued, 'you hadn't heard of her 
marriage?  You knew her as Mrs. Trant.'</p><p> 
     I gave him back his stare.  'Not Mrs. Philip Trant?'</p><p> 
     'Yes; Mrs. Philip Trant.'</p><p> 
     'Not Paulina?' I insisted.</p><p> 
     'Yes&mdash;Paulina,' he said, with a just perceptible delay 
before 
the name. <pb n="148"/> </p><p> 
     In my stupefaction I continued to stare at him, instead of 
turning my gaze toward the lady whose identity was in 
dispute.</p><p> 
     He averted his eyes from mine after a moment, and I saw that 
they had strayed back to her.  'You find her so changed?' he 
asked.</p><p> 
     An odd note in his voice acted as a warning signal, and I 
tried to reduce my astonishment to less unbecoming proportions.  
'I 
don't find that she looks much older.'</p><p> 
     'No.  Only different?' he suggested, as if there were 
nothing 
new to him in my perplexity.</p><p> 
     'Yes&mdash;awfully different,' I confessed.</p><p> 
     'I suppose we're all awfully different.  To you, I mean&mdash; 
coming from so far?'</p><p> 
     'I recognized all the rest of you,' I said, hesitating.  
'And 
she used to be the one who stood out most.'</p><p> 
     There was a flash, a wave, a stir of something deep down in 
his eyes.  'Yes,' he said.  '<hi rend="italic"> That's</hi> the 
difference.'</p><p> 
     'I see it is.  She&mdash;she looks worn down.  Soft but blurred, 
like the figures in the tapestry behind her.</p><p> 
     He glanced at her again, as if to test the exactness of my 
analogy.</p><p> 
     'Life wears everybody down, I suppose,' he said.</p><p> 
     'Yes&mdash;except those it makes more distinct.  They're the rare 
ones, of course; but she was rare.'</p><p> 
     He stood up suddenly, looking old and tired.  'I believe 
I'll 
be off.  I wish you'd come down to my place for Sunday. . . .  
No, 
don't shake hands&mdash;I want to slide away while they're not 
looking.</p><p> 
     We were standing near the door of the inner drawing-room, 
and 
I placed myself before him to say a last word and screen his 
retreat.</p><p> 
     'You will come down, won't you?' he repeated.  'I want to 
see 
you.  There'll be no one else.'  He had backed away to the 
threshold and was turning the noiseless door-knob.  Even Mrs. 
Cumnor's door-knobs had tact and didn't tell!</p><p> 
     'Of course I'll come,' I promised warmly.  In the last ten 
minutes he had begun to interest me again.</p><p> 
     'All right.  Good-bye.'  Half through the door he paused to 
stammer:&mdash;'<hi rend="italic"> She</hi> remembers you.  You ought to speak to 
her.'</p><p> 
     'I'm going to.  But tell me a little more.'  I thought I saw 
a shade of constraint on his face, and did not add, as I had 
meant 
to: 'Tell me&mdash;because she interests me&mdash;what wore her down?'  
Instead, I asked: 'How soon after Trant's death did she 
remarry?'</p><p> 
     He seemed to require an effort of memory to recall the date. 
 
'It was seven years ago, I think.'</p><p> 
     'And is Reardon here to-night?'</p><p> 
     'Yes; over there, talking to Mrs. Cumnor.'</p><p> 
     I looked across the broken lamp-lit groupings and saw a 
large 
glossy man with straw-colored hair and a red face, whose shirt 
and 
shoes and complexion seemed all to have received a coat of the 
same 
expensive varnish.</p><p> 
     As I looked there was a drop in the talk about us, and I 
heard 
Mr. Reardon pronounce in a big booming voice: 'What I say is: 
what's the good of disturbing things?  Thank the Lord, I'm 
content 
with what I've got!'</p><p> 
     'Is <hi rend="italic"> that</hi> her husband?  What's he like?'</p><p> 
     'Oh, the best fellow in the world,' said Merrick, going.

<p> 
     Merrick had a little place at Riverdale, where he went 
occasionally to be near the Iron Works, and where he hid his 
week-ends when the world was too much with him. 
<pb  n="149"/> 
</p><p> 
     Here he awaited me on the following Saturday afternoon, and 
at 
tea-time I found myself with him in a pleasant careless setting 
of 
books and prints and faded parental furniture.</p><p> 
     We dined late, and smoked and talked afterward in his low-ceilinged book-walled study till the terrier on the hearth-rug 
stood up and yawned for bed.  When we took the hint and picked up 
our candles in the hall I felt not that I had found the old 
Merrick 
again, but that I was on his track, had come across traces of his 
passage here and there in the thick jungle that had grown up 
between us.  But I had an odd poignant feeling that when I 
finally 
came on the man himself he might be dead. . . .</p><p> 
     As we started up the shallow country stairs he turned with 
one 
of his abrupt shy movements, and walked back into the 
study.</p><p> 
     'Wait a bit!' he called to me.</p><p> 
     I waited, and he came out in a moment carrying a limp 
folio.'</p><p> 
     'It's typewritten.  Will you take a look at it?  I've been 
trying to get to work again,' he lamely explained, thrusting the 
manuscript into my hand.</p><p> 
     'What?  Poetry, I hope?' I exclaimed.</p><p> 
     He shook his head with a gleam of derision.  'No&mdash;just 
general 
considerations.  The fruit of fifty years of 
inexperience.'</p><p> 
     He showed me to my room and said good-night. 
</p><p> 
     The following afternoon&mdash;it was a mild winter day with soft 
wet gusts, I remember&mdash;we took a long walk inland, across the 
hills, and I said to Merrick what I could of his book.  Unluckily 
there wasn't much to say.  The essays were judicious, polished 
and 
cultivated, but they lacked the freshness and audacity of his 
youthful work.  I tried to conceal my opinion behind the usual 
ambiguities, but he broke through these feints with a quick 
thrust 
to the heart of my meaning.</p><p> 
     'It's worn down&mdash;blurred?  Like the figures in the Cumnors' 
tapestry?'</p><p> 
     I hesitated.  'It's a little too damned resigned,' I 
said.</p><p> 
     'Ah,' he exclaimed, 'so am I.  Resigned.'  He switched the 
bare brambles by the roadside.  'A man can't serve two 
masters.'</p><p> 
     'You mean business and literature?'</p><p> 
     'No; I mean theory and instinct.  The gray tree and the 
green.  
You've got to choose which fruit you'll try; and you don't know 
till afterward which of the two has the dead core.'</p><p> 
     'How can anybody be sure that only one of them has?'</p><p> 
     'I'm sure,' said Merrick sharply.</p><p> 
     We turned back to the subject of his essays, and I was 
astonished at the detachment with which he criticized and 
demolished them.  Little by little, as we talked, his old 
perspective, his old standards came back to him, but with the 
difference that they no longer seemed like functions of his mind 
but merely like attitudes assumed or dropped at will.  He could 
still, with an effort, put himself at the angle from which he had 
formerly seen things; but it was with the effort of a man 
climbing 
mountains after a sedentary life in the plain.</p><p> 
     I tried to cut the talk short, but he kept coming back to it 
with nervous insistence, forcing me into the last retrenchments 
of 
hypocrisy, and anticipating the verdict I held back.  I perceived 
that a great deal&mdash;immensely more than I could see a reason for&mdash; 
had hung for him on my opinion of his book.</p><p> 
     Then, as suddenly, his insistence broke and, as if ashamed 
of 
having forced himself so long on my attention, he began to talk 
rapidly and uninterestingly of other things. 
<pb n="150"/> 
</p><p> 
     We were alone again that evening, and after dinner, wishing 
to 
efface the impression of the afternoon, and above all to show 
that 
I wanted him to talk about himself, I reverted to the subject of 
his work.  'You must need an outlet of that sort.  When a man's 
once had it in him, as you have&mdash;and when other things begin to 
dwindle&mdash;'</p><p> 
     He laughed.  'Your theory is that a man ought to be able to 
return to the Muse as he comes back to his wife after he's ceased 
to interest other women?'</p><p> 
     'No; as he comes back to his wife after the day's work is 
done.'  A new thought came to me as I looked at him.  'You ought 
to 
have had one,' I added.</p><p> 
     He laughed again.  'A wife, you mean?  So that there'd have 
been some one waiting for me even if the Muse decamped?'  He went 
on after a pause: 'I've a notion that the kind of woman worth 
coming back to wouldn't be much more patient than the Muse.  But 
as 
it happens I never tried&mdash;because, for fear they'd chuck me, I 
put 
them both out of doors together.'</p><p> 
     He turned his head abruptly and looked past me with a queer 
expression at the low gray-panelled door at my back.  'Out of 
that 
very door they went&mdash;the two of 'em, on a rainy night like this: 
and one stopped and looked back, to see if I wasn't going to call 
her'&mdash;and I didn't&mdash;and so they both went. . . .'

<p> 
     'The Muse?' (said Merrick, refilling my glass and stooping 
to 
pat the terrier as he went back to his chair)&mdash;'well, you've met 
the Muse in the little volume of sonnets you used to like; and 
you've met the woman too, and you used to like <hi rend="italic"> her;</hi> 
though you 
didn't know her when you saw her the other evening. . . .</p><p> 
     'No, I won't ask you how she struck you: I know.  She struck

conformed&mdash;I've conformed&mdash;the mills have caught us and ground 
us:

     'You may recall that after my father's death I tried 
unsuccessfully to sell the Works.  I was impatient to free myself 
from anything that would keep me tied to New York.  I don't 
dislike 
my trade, and I've made, in the end, a fairly good thing of it; 
but 
industrialism was not, at that time, in the line of my tastes, 
and 
I know now that it wasn't what I was meant for.  Above all, I 
wanted to get away, to see new places and rub up against 
different 
ideas.  I had reached a time of life&mdash;the top of the first hill, 
so 
to speak&mdash;where the distance draws one, and everything in the 
foreground seems tame and stale.  I was sick to death of the 
particular set of conformities I had grown up among; sick of 
being 
a pleasant popular young man with a long line of dinners on my 
engagement list, and the dead certainty of meeting the same 
people, 
or their prototypes, at all of them.</p><p> 
     'Well&mdash;I failed to sell the Works, and that increased my 
discontent.  I went through moods of cold unsociability, 
alternating with sudden flushes of curiosity, when I gloated over 
stray scraps of talk overheard in railway stations and omnibuses, 
when strange faces that I passed in the street tantalized me with 
fugitive promises.  I wanted to get away, among things that were 
unexpected and unknown; and it seemed to me that nobody about me 
understood in the least what I felt, but that somewhere just out 
of 
reach there was some one who <hi rend="italic"> did</hi>, and whom I must find or 
despair. . . . <pb n="151"/> </p><p> 
     'It was just then that, one evening I saw Mrs. Trant for the 
first time.</p><p> 
     'Yes: I know&mdash;you wonder what I mean.  I'd known her, of 
course, as a girl; I'd met her several times after her marriage 
to 
Trant; and I'd lately been thrown with her, quite intimately and 
continuously, during a succession of country-house visits.  But I 
had never, as it happened, really <hi rend="italic"> seen</hi> her till then. . . 
.</p><p> 
     'It was at a dinner at the Cumnors', I remember; and there 
she 
was, in front of the very tapestry we saw her against the other 
evening, with people about her, and her face turned from me, and 
nothing noticeable or different in her dress or manner; and 
suddenly she stood out for me against the pinkish-smoky 
background, 
and for the first time I saw a meaning in the stale phrase of a 
picture's walking out of its frame.  For you've noticed, haven't 
you, that most people <hi rend="italic"> are</hi> just that to us: pictures, 
furniture, 
the inanimate accessories of our little island-area of sensation? 
 
And then sometimes one of these graven images moves and throws 
out 
live filaments toward us, and the line they make draws us across 
the world as the moon-track seems to draw a boat across black 
water. . . .</p><p> 
     'Well, there she stood; and as this queer sensation came 
over 
me I felt that she was looking steadily at me, that her eyes were 
voluntarily, consciously resting on me with the weight of a deep 
interrogation.</p><p> 
     'I went over and joined her, and she turned silently and 
walked with me into the music-room.  Earlier in the evening some 
one had been singing, and there were low lights there, and a few 
couples still sitting in those confidential corners of which Mrs. 
Cumnor has the art; but we were under no illusion as to the 
nature 
of these presences.  We knew that they were just painted in, and 
that the whole of sentient life was in us two, and flowing back 
and 
forward between us in swift innumerable streams.  We talked, of 
course; we had the attitudes, even the words, of the others: I 
remember her telling me her plans for the spring and asking me 
politely about mine!  As if there were the least sense in plans, 
now that this thing had happened to us!</p><p> 
     'When we went back into the drawing-room I had said nothing 
to 
her that I might not have said to any other woman of the party; 
but 
when we said good-bye I knew we should see each other the next 
day&mdash;and the next. . . .</p><p> 
     'That's the way, I take it, that Nature has arranged the 
beginning of the great enduring loves; and likewise of the little 
epidermal flurries.  And how's a man to know where he is 
going?</p><p> 
     'From the first, I own, my feeling for Paulina Trant seemed 
to 
me a grave business; but then I knew that the Enemy is given to 
producing that illusion.  Many a man&mdash;I'm talking of the kind 
with 
imagination&mdash;has thought he was seeking a soul when all he wanted 
was a closer view of its tenement.  And I tried&mdash;honestly 
tried&mdash;to 
make myself think I was in this case.  Because, in the first 
place, 
I didn't just then, want a big disturbing influence in my life; 
and 
because I didn't want to be a dupe; and because Paulina Trant was 
not, according to hearsay, the kind of woman for whom it was 
worth 
while to bring up the big batteries. . . .</p><p> 
     'But my resistance was only half-hearted.  What I really 
felt&mdash;<hi rend="italic"> all</hi> I really felt&mdash;was the flood of joy that comes 
of 
heightened emotion.  She had given me that, and I wanted her to 
give it to me again.  That's as near as I've ever come to 
analyzing 
my state in the beginning.</p><p> 
     'I knew her story, as no doubt you know it: the current 
version, I mean.  She had been poor and fond of 
enjoy-<pb n="152"/> ment, 
and she had married that pompous monolith Philip Trant because 
she 
needed a home, and perhaps also because she wanted a little 
luxury.  
Queer how we sneer at women for wanting the thing that gives them 
half their grace!</p><p> 
     'People shook their heads over the marriage, and divided, 
prematurely, into Philip's partisans and hers: for no one thought 
it would work.  And they were almost disappointed when, after 
all, 
it did.  She and her wooden consort seemed to get on well enough. 
 
There was a ripple at one time, over her close friendship with 
young Jim Dalham, who was always with her during a summer at 
Newport and an autumn in Italy; then the talk died out, and she 
and 
Trant were seen together, as before, on terms of apparent good-fellowship.</p><p> 
     'This was the more surprising because, from the first, 
Paulina 
had never made the least attempt to change her tone or subdue her 
colors.  In the gray Trant atmosphere she flashed with prismatic 
fires.  She smoked, she talked subversively, she did as she liked 
and went where she pleased, and danced over the Trant prejudices 
and the Trant principles as if they'd been a ball-room floor; and 
all without apparent offence to her solemn husband and his cloud 
of 
cousins.  I believe her frankness and directness struck them 
dumb.  
She moved like a kind of primitive Una through the virtuous rout, 
and never got a finger-mark on her freshness.</p><p> 
     'One of the finest things about her was the fact that she 
never, for an instant, used her plight as a means of enhancing 
her 
attraction.  With a husband like Trant it would have been so 
easy!  
He was a man who always saw the small sides of big things.  He 
thought most of life compressible into a set of by-laws and the 
rest unmentionable; and with his stiff frock-coated and 
tall-hatted 
mind, instinctively distrustful of intelligences in another 
dress, 
with his arbitrary classification of whatever he didn't 
understand 
into "the kind of thing I don't approve of," "the kind of thing 
that isn't done," and&mdash;deepest depth of all&mdash;"the kind of thing 
I'd 
rather not discuss," he lived in the service of a shadowy moral 
etiquette, of which the complex rites and awful penalties had 
cast 
an abiding gloom upon his manner.</p><p> 
     'A woman like his wife couldn't have asked a better foil; 
yet 
I'm sure she never consciously used his dullness to relieve her 
brilliancy.  She may have felt that the case spoke for itself.  
But 
I believe her reserve was rather due to a lively sense of 
justice, 
and to the rare habit (you said she was rare) of looking at facts 
as they are, without any throwing of sentimental lime-lights.  
She 
knew Trant could no more help being Trant than she could help 
being 
herself&mdash;and there was an end of it.  I've never known a woman 
who 
"made up" so little mentally. . . .</p><p> 
     'Perhaps her very reserve, the fierceness of her implicit 
rejection of sympathy, exposed her the more to&mdash;well, to what 
happened when we met.  She said afterward that it was like having 
been shut up for months in the hold of a ship, and coming 
suddenly 
on deck on a day that was all flying blue and silver. . . 
.</p><p> 
     'I won't try to tell you what she was.  It's easier to tell 
you what her friendship made of me; and I can do that best by 
adopting her metaphor of the ship.  Haven't you, sometimes, at 
the 
moment of starting on a journey, some glorious plunge into the 
unknown, been tripped up by the thought: "If only one hadn't to 
come back"?  Well, with her one had the sense that one would 
never 
have to come back; that the magic ship would always carry one 
farther.  And what an air one breathed, <pb n="153"/>  on 
it!  And, oh, 
the wind, and the islands, and the sunsets!</p><p> 
     'I said just now "her friendship"; and I used the word 
advisedly.  Love is deeper than friendship, but friendship is a 
good deal wider.  The beauty of our relation was that it included 
both dimensions.  Our thoughts met as naturally as our eyes: it 
was 
almost as if we loved each other because we liked each other.  
I'm 
inclined to think that the quality of a love may be tested by the 
amount of friendship it contains, and in our case there was no 
dividing line between loving and liking, no disproportion between 
them, no barrier against which desire beat in vain or from which 
thought fell back unsatisfied.  Ours was a robust passion that 
could give an open-eyed account of itself, and not a beautiful 
madness shrinking away from the proof. . . .</p><p> 
     'For the first months friendship sufficed us, or rather gave 
us so much by the way that we were in no haste to reach what we 
knew it led to.  But we were moving there nevertheless, and one 
day 
we found ourselves on the borders.  It came about through a 
sudden 
decision of Trant's to start on a long tour with his wife.  We 
had 
never foreseen such a possibility: he seemed rooted in his New 
York 
habits and convinced that the city's whole social and financial 
machinery would cease to function if he did not keep an eye on it 
through the columns of his morning paper and pronounce judgment 
on 
it in the afternoon at his club.  But something new had happened 
to 
him.  He caught a cold, which was followed by a touch of 
pleurisy, 
and instantly he perceived the intense interest and importance 
which ill-health may add to life.  He took the fullest advantage 
of 
it.  A complaisant doctor recommended travel, insisted on a 
winter 
in a warm climate; and suddenly, the morning paper, the afternoon 
club, Fifth Avenue, Wall Street, all the complex phenomena of the 
metropolis, faded into insignificance, and the rest of the 
terrestrial globe, from being a mere geographical hypothesis, 
useful in enabling one to determine the latitude of New York, 
acquired reality and magnitude as a factor in the convalescence 
of 
Mr. Philip Trant.</p><p> 
     'His wife was absorbed in preparations for the journey.  It 
took an army to mobilize him, and weeks before the date set for 
their departure it was almost as if she were already gone.</p><p> 
     'This foretaste of separation showed us what we were to each 
other.  Yet I was letting her go&mdash;and there was no help for it, 
no 
way of preventing it.  Resistance was as useless as the vain 
struggles in a nightmare.  She was Trant's and not mine: a part 
of 
his luggage when he travelled as she was part of his household 
furniture when he stayed at home. . . .</p><p> 
     'The day she told me that their passages were taken&mdash;it was 
on 
a November afternoon, in her drawing-room in town&mdash;I turned away 
from the tea-table and, going to the window, stood looking out at 
the torrent of traffic interminably pouring down Fifth Avenue.  I 
watched the senseless machinery of life revolving in the rain and 
mud, and tried to picture myself performing my small function in 
it 
after she had gone from me.</p><p> 
     '"It can't be&mdash;it can't be!" I exclaimed.</p><p> 
     '"What can't be?"</p><p> 
     'I came back into the room and sat down by her.  "This&mdash; 
this&mdash;" I hadn't any words.  "Two weeks!" I said.  "What's two 
weeks?"</p><p> 
     'She answered vaguely, something about their thinking of 
Spain 
for the spring&mdash;</p><p> 
     '"Two weeks&mdash;two weeks!" I repeated.  "And the months we've 
lost&mdash;the days that belonged to us!" <pb n="154"/> </p><p> 
     '"Yes," she said, "I'm thankful it's settled."</p><p> 
     'Our words seemed irrelevant, haphazard.  It was as if each 
were answering a secret voice and not what the other was 
saying.</p><p> 
     '"Don't you <hi rend="italic"> feel</hi> anything at all?" I remember 
bursting out 
at her.  As I asked it the tears were streaming down her face.  I 
felt angry with her, and was almost glad to note that her lids 
were 
red and that she didn't cry becomingly.  I can't express my 
sensation to you except by saying that she seemed part of life's 
huge league against me.  And suddenly I thought of an afternoon 
we 
had spent together in the country, on a ferny hill-side, when we 
had sat under a beech-tree, and her hand had lain palm upward in 
the moss, close to mine, and I had watched a little black-and-red 
beetle creeping over it. . . .</p><p> 
     'The bell rang, and we heard the voice of a visitor and the 
click of an umbrella in the umbrella-stand.</p><p> 
     'She rose to go into the inner drawing-room, and I caught 
her 
suddenly by the wrist.  "You understand," I said, "that we can't 
go 
on like this?"</p><p> 
     '"I understand," she answered, and moved away to meet her 
visitor.  As I went out I heard her saying in the other room, 
"Yes, 
we're really off on the twelfth."

     'I wrote her a long letter that night, and waited two days 
for 
a reply.</p><p> 
     'On the third day I had a brief line saying that she was 
going 
to spend Sunday with some friends who had a place near Riverdale, 
and that she would arrange to see me while she was there.  That 
was 
all.</p><p> 
     'It was on a Saturday that I received the note and I came 
out 
here the same night.  The next morning was rainy, and I was in 
despair, for I had counted on her asking me to take her for a 
drive 
or a long walk.  It was hopeless to try to say what I had to say 
to 
her in the drawing-room of a crowded country-house.  And only 
eleven days were left!</p><p> 
     'I stayed indoors all the morning, fearing to go out lest 
she 
should telephone me.  But no sign came, and I grew more and more 
restless and anxious.  She was too free and frank for coquetry, 
but 
her silence and evasiveness made me feel that, for some reason, 
she 
did not wish to hear what she knew I meant to say.  Could it be 
that she was, after all, more conventional, less genuine, than I 
had thought?  I went again and again over the whole maddening 
round 
of conjecture; but the only conclusion I could rest in was that, 
if 
she loved me as I loved her, she would be as determined as I was 
to 
let no obstacle come between us during the days that were 
left.</p><p> 
     'The luncheon-hour came and passed, and there was no word 
from 
her.  I had ordered my trap to be ready, so that I might drive 
over 
as soon as she summoned me; but the hours dragged on, the early 
twilight came, and I sat here in this very chair, or measured up 
and down, up and down, the length of this very rug&mdash;and still 
there 
was no message and no letter.</p><p> 
     'It had grown quite dark, and I had ordered away, 
impatiently, 
the servant who came in with the lamps: I couldn't <hi rend="italic"> bear</hi> 
any 
definite sign that the day was over!  And I was standing there on 
the rug, staring at the door, and noticing a bad crack in its 
panel, when I heard the sound of wheels on the gravel.  A word at 
last, no doubt&mdash;a line to explain. . . .  I didn't seem to care 
much for her reasons, and I stood where I was and continued to 
stare at the door.  And suddenly it opened and she came in. 
<pb n="155"/> </p><p> 
     'The servant followed her with a lamp, and then went out and 
closed the door.  Her face looked pale in the lamp-light, but her 
voice was as clear as a bell.</p><p> 
     '"Well," she said, "you see I've come."</p><p> 
     'I started toward her with hands outstretched.  "You've 
come&mdash; 
you've come!" I stammered.</p><p> 
     'Yes; it was like her to come in that way&mdash;without shame, 
without dissimulation, without explanations or excuses.  It was 
like her, if she gave at all, to give not furtively or in haste, 
but openly, deliberately, without stinting the measure or 
counting 
the cost.  But her quietness and serenity disconcerted me.  She 
did 
not look like a woman who has yielded impetuously to an 
uncontrollable impulse.  There was something almost solemn in her 
face.</p><p> 
     'The awe of it stole over me as I looked at her, suddenly 
subduing the huge flush of gratified longing.</p><p> 
     '"You're here, here, here!" I kept repeating, like a child 
singing over a happy word.</p><p> 
     '"You said," she continued, in her grave clear voice, "that 
we 
couldn't go on as we were&mdash;"</p><p> 
     '"Ah, it's divine of you!" I broke in, and held out my arms 
to 
her.</p><p> 
     'She didn't draw back from them, but her faint smile said, 
"Wait," and lifting her hands she took the pins from her hat, and 
laid the hat on the table.</p><p> 
     'As I saw her dear head bare in the lamp-light, with the 
thick 
hair waving away from the parting, I forgot everything but the 
bliss and wonder of her being here&mdash;here, in my house, on my 
hearth&mdash;I can show you, yet, the exact spot where she was 
standing.</p><p> 
     'I drew her over to the fire, and made her sit down in the 
chair where you're sitting, and knelt down by her, and hid my 
face 
on her knees.  She put her hand on my head, and I was happy to 
the 
depths of my soul.</p><p> 
     '"Oh, I forgot&mdash;" she exclaimed suddenly.  I lifted my head 
and our eyes met.  Hers were smiling.</p><p> 
     'She reached out her hand, opened the little bag she had 
tossed down with her hat, and drew a small object from it.  "I 
left 
my trunk at the station," she said.  "Here's the check.  Can you 
send for it?"</p><p> 
     'Her trunk&mdash;she wanted me to send for her trunk!  Oh, yes&mdash;I 
see your smile, your "lucky man!"  Only, you see, I didn't love 
her 
in that way.  I knew she couldn't come to my house without 
running 
a big risk of discovery, and my tenderness for her, my impulse to 
shield her, was stronger, even then, than masculine vanity or 
masculine desire.  Judged from the point of view of those 
emotions 
I fell terribly short of my part.  I hadn't any of the proper 
feelings.  Such an act of romantic folly was so unlike her that 
it 
almost irritated me, and I found myself desperately wondering how 
I could get her to reconsider her plan without&mdash;well, without 
seeming to want her to.</p><p> 
     'It's not the way a novel hero feels; it's probably not the 
way a man in real life ought to have felt.  But it's the way I 
felt&mdash;and she saw it.</p><p> 
     'She put her hands on my shoulders and looked at me with 
deep, 
deep eyes.  "Then you didn't expect me to stay?" she asked, half-smiling.</p><p> 
     'I caught her hands and pressed them close to me, stammering 
out that I hadn't dared to dream. . . .</p><p> 
     '"You thought I'd come&mdash;just for an hour?"</p><p> 
     '"How could I dare think more?  I adore you, you know, for 
what you've done!  But it would be known if you&mdash;if you stayed 
on.  
My servants&mdash;everybody about here knows you.  I've no right to 
expose you to the risk."  She made no answer, and I went on 
<pb n="155"/>  
tenderly: "Give me, if you will, the next few hours: there's a 
train that will get you to town by midnight.  And then we'll 
arrange something&mdash;in town&mdash;where it's safer for you&mdash;easily 
managed. . . .  It's beautiful, it's glorious of you to have 
come; 
but I love you too much&mdash;I must take care of you and think for 
you&mdash;"</p><p> 
     'I don't suppose it ever took me so long to say so few 
words, 
and though they were profoundly sincere they sounded unutterably 
shallow, irrelevant and grotesque.  She made no effort to help me 
out, but sat silent, listening with her meditative smile.  "It's 
my 
duty, dearest, as a man," I rambled on.  "The more I love you the 
more I'm bound&mdash;"</p><p> 
     '"Yes; but you don't understand," she interrupted.</p><p> 
     'She rose as she spoke, and I got up also, and we stood and 
looked at each other.</p><p> 
     '"I haven't come for a night; if you want me I've come for 
always," she said.</p><p> 
     'Here again, if I give you an honest account of my feelings 
I 
shall write myself down as the poor-spirited creature I suppose I 
am.  There wasn't, I swear, at the moment, a gram of selfishness, 
of personal reluctance, in my feeling.  I worshipped every hair 
of 
her head&mdash;when we were together I was happy, when I was away from 
her something was gone from every good thing; but I had always 
looked on our love for each other, our possible relation to each 
other, as such situations are looked on in what is called 
society.  
I had supposed her, for all her freedom and originality, to be 
just 
as tacitly subservient to that view as I was: ready to take what 
she wanted on the terms on which society concedes such taking, 
and 
to pay for it by the usual restrictions, concealments and 
hypocrisies.  In short, I supposed that she would "play the 
game"&mdash; 
look out for her own safety and expect me to look out for it.  It 
sounds cheap enough, put that way&mdash;but it's the rule we live 
under, 
all of us.  And the amazement of finding her suddenly outside of 
it, oblivious of it, unconscious of it, left me, for an awful 
minute, stammering at her like a graceless dolt. . . .  Perhaps 
it 
wasn't even a minute; but in it she had gone the whole round of 
my 
thoughts.</p><p> 
     '"It's raining," she said, very low.  "I suppose you can 
telephone for a trap?"</p><p> 
     'There was no irony or resentment in her voice.  She walked 
slowly across the room and paused before the Brangwyn etching 
over 
there.  "That's a good impression.  <hi rend="italic"> Will</hi> you telephone, 
please?" she repeated.</p><p> 
     'I found my voice again, and with it the power of movement.  
I followed her, and dropped at her feet.  "You can't go like 
this!" 
I cried.</p><p> 
     'She looked down on me from heights and heights.  "I can't 
stay like this," she answered.</p><p> 
     'I stood up and we faced each other like antagonists.  "You 
don't know," I accused her passionately, "in the least what 
you're 
asking me to ask of you!"</p><p> 
     '"Yes, I do: <hi rend="italic"> everything</hi>," she breathed.</p><p> 
     '"And it's got to be that or nothing?"</p><p> 
     '"Oh, on both sides," she reminded me.</p><p> 
     '<hi rend="italic">" Not</hi> on both sides.  It isn't fair.  That's 
why&mdash;"</p><p> 
     '"Why you won't?"</p><p> 
     '"Why I cannot&mdash;may not!"</p><p> 
     '"Why you'll take a night and not a life?"</p><p> 
     'The taunt, for a woman usually so sure of her aim, fell so 
short of the mark that its only effect was to increase my 
conviction of her helplessness.  The very intensity of my longing 
for her made me tremble where she was fear-<pb n="157"/> 
less.  I had to 
protect her first, and think of my own attitude afterward.</p><p> 
     'She was too discerning not to see this too.  Her face 
softened, grew inexpressibly appealing, and she dropped again 
into 
that chair you're in, leaned forward, and looked up with her 
grave 
smile.</p><p> 
     '"You think I'm beside myself&mdash;raving?  (You're not thinking 
of yourself, I know.)  I'm not: I never was saner.  Since I've 
known you I've often thought that this might happen.  This thing 
between us isn't an ordinary thing.  If it had been we shouldn't, 
all these months, have drifted.  We should have wanted to skip to 
the last page&mdash;and then throw down the book.  We shouldn't have 
felt we could <hi rend="italic"> trust</hi> the future as we did.  We were in no 
hurry 
because we knew we shouldn't get tired; and when two people feel 
that about each other they must live together&mdash;or part.  I don't 
see what else they can do.  A little trip along the coast won't 
answer.  It's the high seas&mdash;or else being tied up to Lethe 
wharf.  
And I'm for the high seas, my dear!"</p><p> 
     'Think of sitting here&mdash;here, in this room, in this 
chair&mdash;and 
listening to that, and seeing the light on her hair, and hearing 
the sound of her voice!  I don't suppose there ever was a scene 
just like it. . . .</p><p> 
     'She was astounding&mdash;inexhaustible; through all my anguish 
of 
resistance I found a kind of fierce joy in following her.  It was 
lucidity at white heat: the last sublimation of passion.  She 
might 
have been an angel arguing a point in the empyrean if she hadn't 
been, so completely, a woman pleading for her life. . . .</p><p> 
     'Her life: that was the thing at stake!  She couldn't do 
with 
less of it than she was capable of; and a woman's life is 
inextricably part of the man's she cares for.</p><p> 
     'That was why, she argued, she couldn't accept the usual 
solution: couldn't enter into the only relation that society 
tolerates between people situated like ourselves.  Yes: she knew 
all the arguments on <hi rend="italic"> that</hi> side: didn't I suppose she'd 
been 
over them and over them?  She knew (for hadn't she often said it 
of 
others?) what is said of the woman who, by throwing in her lot 
with 
her lover's, binds him to a life-long duty which has the 
irksomeness without the dignity of marriage.  Oh, she could talk 
on 
that side with the best of them: only she asked me to consider 
the 
other&mdash;the side of the man and woman who love each other deeply 
and 
completely enough to want their lives enlarged, and not 
diminished, 
by their love.  What, in such a case&mdash;she reasoned&mdash;must be the 
inevitable effect of concealing, denying, disowning, the central 
fact, the motive power of one's existence?  She asked me to 
picture 
the course of such a love: first working as a fever in the blood, 
distorting and deflecting everything, making all other interests 
insipid, all other duties irksome, and then, as the acknowledged 
claims of life regained their hold, gradually dying&mdash;the poor 
starved passion!&mdash;for want of the wholesome necessary food of 
common living and doing, yet leaving life impoverished by the 
loss 
of all it might have been.</p><p> 
     '"I'm not talking, dear&mdash;"  I see her now, leaning toward me 
with shining eyes: "I'm not talking of the people who haven't 
enough to fill their days, and to whom a little mystery, a little 
manoeuvring, gives an illusion of importance that they can't 
afford 
to miss; I'm talking of you and me, with all our tastes and 
curiosities and activities; and I ask you what our love would 
become if we had to keep it apart from our lives, like a pretty 
useless animal that we went to peep at and feed with sweet-meats 
through its cage?" <pb n="158"/> </p><p> 
     'I won't, my dear fellow, go into the other side of our 
strange duel: the arguments I used were those that most men in my 
situation would have felt bound to use, and that most women in 
Paulina's accept instinctively, without even formulating them.  
The 
exceptionalness, the significance, of the case lay wholly in the 
fact that she had formulated them all and then rejected them. . . 
.</p><p> 
     'There was one point I didn't, of course, touch on, and that 
was the popular conviction (which I confess I shared) that when a 
man and a woman agree to defy the world together the man really 
sacrifices much more than the woman.  I was not even conscious of 
thinking of this at the time, though it may have lurked somewhere 
in the shadow of my scruples for her; but she dragged it out into 
the daylight and held me face to face with it.</p><p> 
     '"Remember, I'm not attempting to lay down any general 
rule," 
she insisted; "I'm not theorizing about Man and Woman, I'm 
talking 
about you and me.  How do I know what's best for the woman in the 
next house?  Very likely she'll bolt when it would have been 
better 
for her to stay at home.  And it's the same with the man: he'll 
probably do the wrong thing.  It's generally the weak heads that 
commit follies, when it's the strong ones that ought to; and my 
point is that you and I are both strong enough to behave like 
fools 
if we want to. . . .</p><p> 
     '"Take your own case first&mdash;because, in spite of the 
sentimentalists, it's the man who stands to lose most.  You'll 
have 
to give up the Iron Works: which you don't much care 
about&mdash;because 
it won't be particularly agreeable for us to live in New York: 
which you don't care much about either.  But you won't be 
sacrificing what is called a 'career.'  You made up your mind 
long 
ago that your best chance of self-development, and consequently 
of 
general usefulness, lay in thinking rather than doing, and, when 
we 
first met, you were already planning to sell out your business, 
and 
travel and write.  Well!  Those ambitions are of a kind that 
won't 
be harmed by your dropping out of your social setting.  On the 
contrary, such work as you want to do ought to gain by it, 
because 
you'll be brought nearer to life-as-it-is, in contrast to 
life-as-a-visiting-list. . . ."</p><p> 
     'She threw back her head with a sudden laugh.  "And the joy 
of 
not having any more visits to make!  I wonder if you've ever 
thought of <hi rend="italic"> that?</hi>  Just at first, I mean; for society's 
getting 
so deplorably lax that, little by little, it will edge up to us&mdash; 
you'll see!  I don't want to idealize the situation, dearest, and 
I won't conceal from you that in time we shall be called on.  
But, 
oh, the fun we shall have had in the interval!  And then, for the 
first time we shall be able to dictate our own terms, one of 
which 
will be that no bores need apply.  Think of being cured of all 
one's chronic bores!  We shall feel as jolly as people after a 
successful operation."</p><p> 
     'I don't know why this nonsense sticks in my mind when some 
of 
the graver things we said are less distinct.  Perhaps it's 
because 
of a certain iridescent quality of feeling that made her gaiety 
seem like sunshine through a shower. . . .</p><p> 
     '"You ask me to think of myself?" she went on.  "But the 
beauty of our being together will be that, for the first time, I 
shall dare to!  Now I have to think of all the tedious trifles I 
can pack the days with, because I'm afraid&mdash;I'm afraid&mdash;to hear 
the 
voice of the real me, down below, in the windowless underground 
hole where I keep her. . . .</p><p> 
     '"Remember, again, please, it's not Woman, it's Paulina 
Trant, 
I'm talking of.  The woman in the next house <pb n="159"/>  
may have all 
sorts of reasons&mdash;honest reasons&mdash;for staying there.  There may 
be 
some one there who needs her badly: for whom the light would go 
out 
if she went.  Whereas to Philip I've been simply&mdash;well, what New 
York was before he decided to travel: the most important thing in 
life till he made up his mind to leave it; and now merely the 
starting-place of several lines of steamers.  Oh, I didn't have 
to 
love you to know that!  I only had to live with <hi rend="italic"> him</hi>. . . 
.  If 
he lost his eye-glasses he'd think it was the fault of the eye-glasses; he'd really feel that the eye-glasses had been careless. 
 
And he'd be convinced that no others would suit him quite as 
well.  
But at the optician's he'd probably be told that he needed 
something a little different, and after that he'd feel that the 
old 
eye-glasses had never suited him at all, and that <hi rend="italic"> that</hi> 
was 
their fault too. . . .</p><p> 
     'At one moment&mdash;but I don't recall when&mdash;I remember she 
stood 
up with one of her quick movements, and came toward me, holding 
out 
her arms.  "Oh, my dear, I'm pleading for my life; do you suppose 
I'll ever want for arguments?" she cried. . . .</p><p> 
     'After that, for a bit, nothing much remains with me except 
a 
sense of darkness and of conflict.  The one spot of daylight in 
my 
whirling brain was the conviction that I couldn't&mdash;whatever 
happened&mdash;profit by the sudden impulse she had acted on, and 
allow 
her to take, in a moment of passion, a decision that was to shape 
her whole life.  I couldn't so much as lift my little finger to 
keep her with me then, unless I were prepared to accept for her 
as 
well as for myself the full consequences of the future she had 
planned for us. . . .</p><p> 
     'Well&mdash;there's the point: I wasn't.  I felt in her&mdash;poor 
fatuous idiot that I was!&mdash;that lack of objective imagination 
which 
had always seemed to me to account, at least in part, for many of 
the so-called heroic qualities in women.  When their feelings are 
involved they simply can't look ahead.  Her unfaltering logic 
notwithstanding, I felt this about Paulina as I listened.  She 
had 
a specious air of knowing where she was going, but she didn't.  
She 
seemed the genius of logic and understanding, but the demon of 
illusion spoke through her lips. . . .</p><p> 
     'I said just now that I hadn't, at the outset, given my own 
side of the case a thought.  It would have been truer to say that 
I hadn't given it a <hi rend="italic"> separate</hi> thought.  But I couldn't 
think of 
her without seeing myself as a factor&mdash;the chief factor&mdash;in her 
problem, and without recognizing that whatever the experiment 
made 
of me, that it must fatally, in the end, make of her.  If I 
couldn't carry the thing through she must break down with me: we 
should have to throw our separate selves into the melting-pot of 
this mad adventure and be "one" in a terrible indissoluble 
completeness of which marriage is only an imperfect counterpart. 
. 
. .</p><p> 
     'There could be no better proof of her extraordinary power 
over me, and of the way she had managed to clear the air of 
sentimental illusion, than the fact that I presently found myself 
putting this to her with a merciless precision of touch.</p><p> 
     '"If we love each other enough to do a thing like this, we 
must love each other enough to see just what it is we're going to 
do."</p><p> 
     'So I invited her to the dissecting-table, and I see now the 
fearless eye with which she approached the cadaver.  "For that's 
what it is, you know," she flashed out at me, at the end of my 
long 
demonstration.  "It's a dead body, like all the instances and 
examples and hypothetical cases that ever were!  What do you 
expect 
to <pb n="160"/>  learn from <hi rend="italic"> that?</hi>  The first great 
anatomist was the 
man who stuck his knife in a heart that was beating; and the only 
way to find out what doing a thing will be like is to do 
it!"</p><p> 
     'She looked away from me suddenly, as if she were fixing her 
eyes on some vision on the outer rim of consciousness.  "No: 
there's one other way," she exclaimed; "and that is, <hi rend="italic"> not</hi> 
to do 
it!  To abstain and refrain; and then see what we become, or what 
we don't become, in the long run, and draw our inferences.  
That's 
the game that almost everybody about us is playing, I suppose; 
there's hardly one of the dull people one meets at dinner who 
hasn't had, just once, the chance of a berth on a ship that was 
off 
for the Happy Isles, and hasn't refused it for fear of sticking 
on 
a sand-bank!</p><p> 
     '"I'm doing my best, you know," she continued, "to see the 
sequel as you see it, as you believe it's your duty to me to see 
it.  I know the instances you're thinking of: the listless 
couples 
wearing out their lives in shabby watering places, and hanging on 
the favor of hotel acquaintances; or the proud quarrelling 
wretches 
shut up alone in a fine house because they're too good for the 
only 
society they can get, and trying to cheat their boredom by 
squabbling with their tradesmen and spying on their servants.  No 
doubt there are such cases; but I don't recognize either of us in 
those dismal figures.  Why, to do it would be to admit that our 
life, yours and mine, is in the people about us and not in 
ourselves; that we're parasites and not self-sustaining 
creatures; 
and that the lives we're leading now are so brilliant, full and 
satisfying that what we should have to give up would surpass even 
the blessedness of being together!"</p><p> 
     'At that stage, I confess, the solid ground of my resistance 
began to give way under me.  It was not that my convictions were 
shaken, but that she had swept me into a world whose laws were 
different, where one could reach out in directions that the slave 
of gravity hasn't pictured.  But at the same time my opposition 
hardened from reason into instinct.  I knew it was her voice, and 
not her logic, that was unsettling me.  I knew that if she'd 
written out her thesis and sent it me by post I should have made 
short work of it; and again the part of me which I called by all 
the finest names: my chivalry, my unselfishness, my superior 
masculine experience, cried out with one voice: "You can't let a 
woman use her graces to her own undoing&mdash;you can't, for her own 
sake, let her eyes convince you when her reasons don't!"</p><p> 
     'And then, abruptly, and for the first time, a doubt entered 
me: a doubt of her perfect moral honesty.  I don't know how else 
to 
describe my feeling that she wasn't playing fair, that in coming 
to 
my house, in throwing herself at my head (I called things by 
their 
names), she had perhaps not so much obeyed an irresistible 
impulse 
as deeply, deliberately reckoned on the dissolvent effect of her 
generosity, her rashness and her beauty. . . .</p><p> 
     'From the moment that this mean doubt raised its head in me 
I 
was once more the creature of all the conventional scruples: I 
was 
repeating, before the looking-glass of my self-consciousness, all 
the stereotyped gestures of the "man of honour." . . .  Oh, the 
sorry figure I must have cut!  You'll understand my dropping the 
curtain on it as quickly as I can. . . .</p><p> 
     'Yet I remember, as I made my point, being struck by its 
impressiveness.  I was suffering and enjoying my own suffering.  
I 
told her that, whatever step we decided to take, I owed it to her 
to insist on its being taken soberly, deliberately&mdash; 
<pb n="161"/> 
</p><p> 
     '("No: it's 'advisedly,' isn't it?  Oh, I was thinking of 
the 
Marriage Service," she interposed with a faint laugh.)</p><p> 
     '&mdash;that if I accepted, there, on the spot, her headlong 
beautiful gift of herself, I should feel that I had taken an 
unmanly advantage of her, an advantage which she would be 
justified 
in reproaching me with ever afterward; that I was not afraid to 
tell her this because she was intelligent enough to know that my 
scruples were the surest proof of the quality of my love; that I 
refused to owe my happiness to an unconsidered impulse; that we 
must see each other again, in her own house, in less agitating 
circumstances, when she had had time to reflect on my words, to 
study her heart and look into the future. . . .</p><p> 
     'The factitious exhilaration produced by uttering these 
beautiful sentiments did not last very long, as you may imagine.  
It fell, little by little, under her quiet gaze, a gaze in which 
there was neither contempt nor irony nor wounded pride, but only 
a 
tender wistfulness of interrogation; and I think the acutest 
point 
in my suffering was reached when she said, as I ended: "Oh, yes, 
of 
course I understand."</p><p> 
     '"If only you hadn't come to me here!" I blurted out in the 
torture of my soul.</p><p> 
     'She was on the threshold when I said it, and she turned and 
laid her hand gently on mine.  "There was no other way," she 
said; 
and at the moment it seemed to me like some hackneyed phrase in a 
novel that she had used without any sense of its meaning.</p><p> 
     'I don't remember what I answered or what more we either of 
us 
said.  At the end a desperate longing to take her in my arms and 
keep her with me swept aside everything else, and I went up to 
her, 
pleading, stammering, urging I don't know what. . . .  But she 
held 
me back with a quiet look, and went.  I had ordered the carriage, 
as she asked me to; and my last definite recollection is of 
watching her drive off alone in the rain. . . .</p><p> 
     'I had her promise that she would see me, two days later, at 
her house in town, and that we should then have what I called "a 
decisive talk"; but I don't think that even at the moment I was 
the 
dupe of my phrase.  I knew, and she knew, that the end had come.

     'It was about that time (Merrick went on after a long pause) 
that I definitely decided not to sell the Works, but to stick to 
my 
job and conform my life to it.</p><p> 
     'I can't describe to you the rage of conformity that 
possessed 
me.  Poetry, ideas&mdash;all the picture-making processes stopped.  A 
kind of dull self-discipline seemed to me the only exercise 
worthy 
of a reflecting mind.  I <hi rend="italic"> had</hi> to justify my great refusal, 
and 
I tried to do it by plunging myself up to the eyes into the very 
conditions I had been instinctively struggling to get away from.  
The only possible consolation would have been to find in a life 
of 
business routine and social submission such moral compensations 
as 
may reward the citizen if they fail the man; but to attain to 
these 
I should have had to accept the old delusion that the social and 
the individual man are two.  Now, on the contrary, I found soon 
enough that I couldn't get one part of my machinery to work 
effectively while another wanted feeding; and that in rejecting 
what had seemed to me a negation of action I had made all my 
action 
negative.</p><p> 
     'The best solution, of course, would have been to fall in 
love 
with another woman, but it was long before I could bring myself 
to 
wish that this might <pb n="162"/>  happen to me. . . .  
Then, at length, 
I suddenly and violently desired it; and as such impulses are 
seldom without some kind of imperfect issue I contrived, a year 
or 
two later, to work myself up into the wished-for state. . . .  
She 
was a woman in society, and with all the awe of that institution 
that Paulina lacked.  Our relation was consequently one of those 
unavowed affairs in which triviality is the only alternative to 
tragedy.  Luckily we had, on both sides, risked only as much as 
prudent people stake in a drawing-room game; and when the match 
was 
over I take it that we came out fairly even.</p><p> 
     'My gain, at all events, was of an unexpected kind.  The 
adventure had served only to make me understand Paulina's 
abhorrence of such experiments, and at every turn of the slight 
intrigue I had felt how exasperating and belittling such a 
relation 
was bound to be between two people who, had they been free, would 
have mated openly.  And so from a brief phase of imperfect 
forgetting I was driven back to a deeper and more understanding 
remembrance. . . .</p><p> 
     'This second incarnation of Paulina was one of the strangest 
episodes of the whole strange experience.  Things she had said 
during our extraordinary talk, things I had hardly heard at the 
time, came back to me with singular vividness and a fuller 
meaning.  
I hadn't any longer the cold consolation of believing in my own 
perspicacity: I saw that her insight had been deeper and keener 
than mine.</p><p> 
     'I remember, in particular, starting up in bed one sleepless 
night as there flashed into my head the meaning of her last 
words: 
"There was no other way"; the phrase I had half-smiled at at the 
time, as a parrot-like echo of the novel-heroine's stock 
farewell.  
I had never, up to that moment, wholly understood why Paulina had 
come to my house that night.  I had never been able to make that 
particular act&mdash;which could hardly, in the light of her 
subsequent 
conduct, be dismissed as a blind surge of passion&mdash;square with my 
conception of her character.  She was at once the most 
spontaneous 
and the steadiest-minded woman I had ever known, and the last to 
wish to owe any advantage to surprise, to unpreparedness, to any 
play on the spring of sex.  The better I came, retrospectively, 
to 
know her, the more sure I was of this, and the less intelligible 
her act appeared.  And then, suddenly, after a night of hungry 
restless thinking, the flash of illumination came.  She had come 
to 
my house, had brought her trunk with her, had thrown herself at 
my 
head with all possible violence and publicity, in order to give 
me 
a pretext, a loophole, an honorable excuse for doing and saying&mdash; 
why, precisely what I had said and done!</p><p> 
     'As the idea came to me it was as if some ironic hand had 
touched an electric button, and all my fatuous phrases had leapt 
out on me in fire.</p><p> 
     'Of course she had known all along just the kind of thing I 
should say if I didn't at once open my arms to her; and to save 
my 
pride, my dignity, my conception of the figure I was cutting in 
her 
eyes, she had recklessly and magnificently provided me with the 
decentest pretext a man could have for doing a pusillanimous 
thing. 
. . .</p><p> 
     'With that discovery the whole case took a different aspect. 
 
It hurt less to think of Paulina&mdash;and yet it hurt more.  The 
tinge 
of bitterness, of doubt, in my thoughts of her had had a tonic 
quality.  It was harder to go on persuading myself that I had 
done 
right as, bit by bit, my theories crumbled under the test of 
time.  
Yet, after all, as she herself had said, one could judge of 
results 
only in the long run. <pb n="163"/> </p><p> 
     'The Trants stayed away for two years; and about a year 
after 
they got back, you may remember, Trant was killed in a railway 
accident.  You know Fate's way of untying a knot after everybody 
has given up tugging at it!</p><p> 
     'Well&mdash;there I was, completely justified: all my weaknesses 
turned into merits!  I had "saved" a weak woman from herself, I 
had 
kept her to the path of duty, I had spared her the humiliation of 
scandal and the misery of self-reproach; and now I had only to 
put 
out my hand and take the reward I deserved.</p><p> 
     'I had avoided Paulina since her return, and she had made no 
effort to see me.  But after Trant's death I wrote her a few 
lines, 
to which she sent a friendly answer; and when a decent interval 
had 
elapsed, and I asked if I might call on her, she answered at once 
that she would see me.</p><p> 
     'I went to her house with the fixed intention of asking her 
to 
marry me&mdash;and I left it without having done so.  Why?  I don't 
know 
that I can tell you.  Perhaps you would have had to sit there 
opposite her, knowing what I did and feeling as I did, to 
understand why.  She was kind, she was compassionate&mdash;I could see 
she didn't want to make it hard for me.  Perhaps she even wanted 
to 
make it easy.  But there, between us, was the memory of the 
gesture 
I hadn't made, forever parodying the one I was attempting!  There 
wasn't a word I could think of that hadn't an echo in it of words 
of hers I had been deaf to; there wasn't an appeal I could make 
that didn't mock the appeal I had rejected.  I sat there and 
talked 
of her husband's death; of her plans, of my sympathy; and I knew 
she understood; and knowing that, in a way, made it harder. . . . 
 
The door-bell rang and the footman came in to ask if she would 
receive other visitors.  She looked at me a moment and said 
"Yes," 
and I stood up and shook hands with her and went away.</p><p> 
     'A few days later she sailed for Europe, and the next time 
we 
met she had married Reardon. . . .'
