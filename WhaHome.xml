<p>THE young men of our American Relief Corps are beginning to 
come 
back from the front with stories.</p><p> 
     There was no time to pick them up during the first 
months&mdash;the 
whole business was too wild and grim.  The horror has not 
decreased, but nerves and sight are beginning to be disciplined 
to 
it.  In the earlier days, moreover, such fragments of experience 
as 
one got were torn from their setting like bits of flesh scattered 
by shrapnel.  Now things that seemed disjointed are beginning to 
link themselves together, and the broken bones of history are 
rising from the battle-fields.</p><p> 
     I can't say that, in this respect, all the members of the 
Relief Corps have made the most of their opportunity.  Some are 
obtuse, or perhaps simply inarticulate; others, when going beyond 
the bald statistics of their job, tend at once to drop into 
sentiment and cinema scenes; and none but H. Macy Greer has the 
gift of making the thing told seem as true as if one had seen it. 
 
So it is on H. Macy Greer that I depend, and when his motor 
dashes 
him back to Paris for supplies I never fail to hunt him down and 
coax him to my rooms for dinner and a long cigar.</p><p> 
     Greer is a small hard-muscled youth, with pleasant manners, 
a 
sallow face, straight hemp-coloured hair, and grey eyes of 
unexpected inwardness.  He has a voice like thick soup, and 
speaks 
with the slovenly drawl of the new generation of Americans, 
dragging his words along like reluctant dogs on a string, and 
depriving his narrative of every shade of expression that 
intelligent intonation gives.  But his eyes see so much that they 
make one see even what his foggy voice obscures.</p><p> 
     Some of his tales are dark and dreadful, some are 
unutterably 
sad, and some end in a huge laugh of irony.  I am not sure how I 
ought to classify the one I have written down here.

<p> 
     ON my first dash to the Northern fighting line&mdash;Greer told 
me 
the other night&mdash;I carried supplies to an ambulance where the 
surgeon asked me to have a talk with an officer who was badly 
wounded and fretting for news of his people in the east of 
France.</p><p> 
     He was a young Frenchman, a cavalry lieutenant, trim and 
slim, 
with a pleasant smile and obstinate blue eyes that I liked.  He 
looked as if he could hold on tight when it was worth his while.  
He had had a leg smashed, poor devil, in the first fighting in 
Flanders, and had been dragging on for weeks in the squalid camp-hospital where I found him.  He didn't waste any words on 
himself, 
but began at once about his family.  They were living, when the 
war 
broke out, at their country-place in the Vosges; his father and 
mother, his sister, just eighteen, and his brother Alain, two 
years 
younger.  His father, the Comte de Rechamp, had married late in 
life, and was over seventy: his mother, a good deal younger, was 
crippled with rheumatism; and there was, besides&mdash;to round off 
the 
group&mdash;a helpless but intensely alive and domineering old 
grandmother about whom all the others revolved.  You know how 
French families hang together, and throw out branches that make 
new 
roots but keep hold of the central trunk, like that tree&mdash;what's 
it 
called?&mdash;that they give pictures of in books about the 
East.</p><p> 
     Jean de Rechamp&mdash;that was my lieutenant's name&mdash;told me his 
family was a typical case.  "We're very <hi rend="italic"> province</hi>," he 
said.  
"My people live at Rechamp all the year.  We have a house at 
Nancy--rather a fine old hotel&mdash;but my parents <pb n="703"/>  go 
there only once 
in two or three years, for a few weeks.  That's our 'season.' . . 
.  Imagine the point of view!  Or rather don't, because you 
couldn't. . ."  (He had been about the world a good deal, and 
known 
something of other angles of vision.)</p><p> 
     Well, of this helpless exposed little knot of people he had 
had no word&mdash;simply nothing&mdash;since the first of August.  He was 
at 
home, staying with them at Rechamp, when war broke out.  He was 
mobilized the first day, and had only time to throw his traps 
into 
a cart and dash to the station.  His depot was on the other side 
of 
France, and communications with the East by mail and telegraph 
were 
completely interrupted during the first weeks.  His regiment was 
sent at once to the fighting line, and the first news he got came 
to him in October, from a communique in a Paris paper a month 
old, 
saying: "The enemy yesterday retook Rechamp."  After that, dead 
silence: and the poor devil left in the trenches to digest that 
<hi rend="italic"> 
"retook"!</hi></p><p> 
     There are thousands and thousands of just such cases; and 
men 
bearing them, and cracking jokes, and hitting out as hard as they 
can.  Jean de Rechamp knew this, and tried to crack jokes 
too&mdash;but 
he got his leg smashed just afterward, and ever since he'd been 
lying on a straw pallet under a horse-blanket, saying to himself: 
<hi rend="italic"> "Rechamp retaken."</hi></p><p> 
     "Of course," he explained with a weary smile, "as long as 
you 
can tot up your daily bag in the trenches it's a sort of 
satisfaction&mdash;though I don't quite know why; anyhow, you're so 
dead-beat at night that no dreams come.  But lying here staring 
at 
the ceiling one goes through the whole business once an hour, at 
the least: the attack, the slaughter, the ruins . . . and worse. 
. 
.  Haven't I seen and heard things enough on <hi rend="italic"> this</hi> side to 
know 
what's been happening on the other?  Don't try to sugar the dose. 
 
I <hi rend="italic"> like</hi> it bitter."</p><p> 
     I was three days in the neighbourhood, and I went back every 
day to see him.  He liked to talk to me because he had a faint 
hope 
of my getting news of his family when I returned to Paris.  I 
hadn't much myself, but there was no use telling him so.  
Besides, 
things change from day to day, and when we parted I promised to 
get 
word to him as soon as I could find out anything.  We both knew, 
of 
course, that that would not be till Rechamp was taken a third 
time&mdash;by his own troops; and perhaps, soon after that, I should 
be 
able to get there, or near there, and make enquiries myself.  To 
make sure that I should forget nothing, he drew the family 
photographs from under his pillow, and handed them over: the 
little 
witch-grandmother, with a face like a withered walnut, the 
father, 
a fine broken-looking old boy with a Roman nose and a weak chin, 
the mother, in crape, simple, serious and provincial, the little 
sister ditto, and Alain, the young brother&mdash;just the age the 
brutes 
have been carrying off to German prisons&mdash;an over-grown thread-paper boy with too much forehead and eyes, and not a muscle in 
his 
body.  A charming-looking family, distinguished and amiable; but 
all, except the grandmother, rather usual.  The kind of people 
who 
come in sets.</p><p> 
     As I pocketed the photographs I noticed that another lay 
face 
down by his pillow.  "Is that for me too?" I asked.</p><p> 
     He coloured and shook his head, and I felt I had blundered.  
But after a moment he turned the photograph over and held it 
out.</p><p> 
     "It's the young girl I am engaged to.  She was at Rechamp 
visiting my parents when war was declared; but she was to leave 
the 
day after I did. . ."  He hesitated.  "There may have been some 
difficulty about her going. . .  I should like to be sure she got 
away. . .  Her name is Yvonne Malo."</p><p> 
     He did not offer me the photograph, and I did not need it.  
That girl had a face of her own!  Dark and keen and splendid: a 
type so different from the others that I found myself staring.  
If 
he had not said <hi rend="italic"> "ma fiancee"</hi> I should have understood 
better.  
After another pause he went on: "I will give you her address in 
Paris.  She has no family: she lives alone&mdash;she is a musician.  
Perhaps you may find her there."  His colour deepened again as he 
added: "But I know nothing&mdash;I have had no news of her 
either."</p><p> 
     To ease the silence that followed I suggested: "But if she 
has 
no family, wouldn't she have been likely to stay with 
<pb n="704"/>  your 
people, and wouldn't that be the reason of your not hearing from 
her?"</p><p> 
     "Oh, no&mdash;I don't think she stayed."  He seemed about to add: 
"If she could help it," but shut his lips and slid the picture 
out 
of sight.</p><p> 
     As soon as I got back to Paris I made enquiries, but without 
result.  The Germans had been pushed back from that particular 
spot 
after a fortnight's intermittent occupation; but their lines were 
close by, across the valley, and Rechamp was still in a net of 
trenches.  No one could get to it, and apparently no news could 
come from it.  For the moment, at any rate, I found it impossible 
to get in touch with the place.</p><p> 
     My enquiries about Mlle. Malo were equally unfruitful.  I 
went 
to the address Rechamp had given me, somewhere off in Passy, 
among 
gardens, in what they call a "Square," no doubt because it's 
oblong: a kind of long narrow court with rather aesthetic-looking 
studio buildings round it.  Mlle. Malo lived in one of them, on 
the 
top floor, the concierge said, and I looked up and saw a big 
studio 
window, and a roof-terrace with dead gourds dangling from a 
pergola.  But she wasn't there, she hadn't been there, and they 
had 
no news of her.  I wrote to Rechamp of my double failure, he sent 
me back a line of thanks; and after that for a long while I heard 
no more of him.</p><p> 
     By the beginning of November the enemy's hold had begun to 
loosen in the Argonne and along the Vosges, and one day we were 
sent off to the East with a couple of ambulances.  Of course we 
had 
to have military chauffeurs, and the one attached to my ambulance 
happened to be a fellow I knew.  The day before we started, in 
talking over our route with him, I said: "I suppose we can manage 
to get to Rechamp now?"  He looked puzzled&mdash;it was such a little 
place that he'd forgotten the name.  "Why do you want to get 
there?" he wondered.  I told him, and he gave an exclamation.  
"Good God!  Of course&mdash;but how extraordinary!  Jean de Rechamp's 
here now, in Paris, too lame for the front, and driving a motor." 
 
We stared at each other, and he went on: "He must take my 
place&mdash;he 
must go with you.  I don't know how it can be done; but done it 
shall be."</p><p> 
     Done it was, and the next morning at daylight I found Jean 
de 
Rechamp at the wheel of my car.  He looked another fellow from 
the 
wreck I had left in the Flemish hospital; all made over, and 
burning with activity, but older, and with lines about his eyes.  
He had had news from his people in the interval, and had learned 
that they were still at Rechamp, and well.  What was more 
surprising was that Mlle. Malo was with them&mdash;had never left.  
Alain had been got away to England, where he remained; but none 
of 
the others had budged.  They had fitted up an ambulance in the 
chateau, and Mlle. Malo and the little sister were nursing the 
wounded.  There were not many details in the letters, and they 
had 
been a long time on the way; but their tone was so reassuring 
that 
Jean could give himself up to unclouded anticipation.  You may 
fancy if he was grateful for the chance I was giving him; for of 
course he couldn't have seen his people in any other way.</p><p> 
     Our permits, as you know, don't as a rule let us into the 
firing-line: we only take supplies to second-line ambulances, and 
carry back the badly wounded in need of delicate operations.  So 
I 
wasn't in the least sure we should be allowed to go to Rechamp&mdash; 
though I had made up my mind to get there, anyhow.</p><p> 
     We were about a fortnight on the way, coming and going in 
Champagne and the Argonne, and that gave us time to get to know 
each other.  It was bitter cold, and after our long runs over the 
lonely frozen hills we used to crawl into the cafe of the inn&mdash;if 
there was one&mdash;and talk and talk.  We put up in fairly rough 
places, generally in a farm house or a cottage packed with 
soldiers; for the villages have all remained empty since the 
autumn, except when troops are quartered in them.  Usually, to 
keep 
warm, we had to go up after supper to the room we shared, and get 
under the blankets with our clothes on.  Once some jolly Sisters 
of 
Charity took us in at their Hospice, and we slept two nights in 
an 
ice-cold whitewashed cell&mdash;but what tales we heard around their 
kitchen-fire!  The Sisters had stayed alone to face the Germans, 
had seen the town burn, and had made the Teutons turn the hose on 
the singed roof of their Hospice and beat the fire back 
<pb n="705"/>  
from it.  It's a pity those Sisters of Charity can't marry. . 
.</p><p> 
     Rechamp told me a lot in those days.  I don't believe he was 
talkative before the war, but his long weeks in hospital, 
starving 
for news, had unstrung him.  And then he was mad with excitement 
at 
getting back to his own place.  In the interval he'd heard how 
other people caught in their country-houses had fared&mdash;you know 
the 
stories we all refused to believe at first, and that we now 
prefer 
not to think about. . .  Well, he'd been thinking about those 
stories pretty steadily for some months; and he kept repeating: 
"My 
people say they're all right&mdash;but they give no details."</p><p> 
     "You see," he explained, "there never were such helpless 
beings.  Even if there had been time to leave, they couldn't have 
done it.  My mother had been having one of her worst attacks of 
rheumatism&mdash;she was in bed, helpless, when I left.  And my 
grandmother, who is a demon of activity in the house, won't stir 
out of it.  We haven't been able to coax her into the garden for 
years.  She says it's draughty; and you know how we all feel 
about 
draughts!  As for my father, he hasn't had to decide anything 
since 
the Comte de Chambord refused to adopt the tricolour.  My father 
decided that he was right, and since then there has been nothing 
particular for him to take a stand about.  But I know how he 
behaved just as well as if I'd been there&mdash;he kept saying: 'One 
must act&mdash;one must act!' and sitting in his chair and doing 
nothing.  Oh, I'm not disrespectful: they were <hi rend="italic"> like</hi> that 
in his 
generation!  Besides&mdash;it's better to laugh at things, isn't it"  
And suddenly his face would darken. . .</p><p> 
     On the whole, however, his spirits were good till we began 
to 
traverse the line of ruined towns between Sainte Menehould and 
Bar-le-Duc.  "This is the way the devils came," he kept saying to me; 
and I saw he was hard at work picturing the work they must have 
done in his own neighbourhood.</p><p> 
     "But since your sister writes that your people are 
safe!"</p><p> 
     "They may have made her write that to reassure me.  They'd 
heard I was badly wounded.  And, mind you, there's never been a 
line from my mother."</p><p> 
     "But you say your mother's hands are so lame that she can't 
hold a pen.  And wouldn't Mlle. Malo have written you the 
truth?"</p><p> 
     At that his frown would lift.  "Oh, yes.  She would despise 
any attempt at concealment."</p><p> 
     "Well, then&mdash;what the deuce is the matter?"</p><p> 
     "It's when I see these devils' traces&mdash;" he could only 
mutter.</p><p> 
     One day, when we had passed through a particularly 
devastated 
little place, and had got from the cure some more than usually 
abominable details of things done there, Rechamp broke out to me 
over the kitchen-fire of our night's lodging.  "When I hear 
things 
like that I don't believe anybody who tells me my people are all 
right!"</p><p> 
     "But you know well enough," I insisted, "that the Germans 
are 
not all alike&mdash;that it all depends on the particular officer. . 
."</p><p> 
     "Yes, yes, I know," he assented, with a visible effort at 
impartiality.  "Only, you see&mdash;as one gets nearer. . ."  He went 
on 
to say that, when he had been sent from the ambulance at the 
front 
to a hospital at Moulins, he had been for a day or two in a ward 
next to some wounded German soldiers&mdash;bad cases, they were&mdash;and 
had 
heard them talking.  They didn't know he knew German, and he had 
heard things. . .  There was one name always coming back in their 
talk, von Scharlach, Oberst von Scharlach.  One of them, a young 
fellow, said: "I wish now I'd cut my hand off rather than do what 
he told us to that night. . .  Every time the fever comes I see 
it 
all again.  I wish I'd been struck dead first."  They all said 
"Scharlach" with a kind of terror in their voices, as if he might 
hear them even there, and come down on them horribly.  Rechamp 
had 
asked where their regiment came from, and had been told: From the 
Vosges.  That had set his brain working, and whenever he saw a 
ruined village, or heard a tale of savagery, the Scharlach nerve 
began to quiver.  At such times it was no use reminding him that 
the Germans had had at least three hundred thousand men in the 
east 
in August.  He simply didn't listen. . . 

</p> 
</div1> 
<div1 type="section" n="3" id="d5"><pb n="706"/>   <head>III</head> 
<p> 
     THE day before we started for Rechamp his spirits flew up 
again, and that night he became confidential.  "You've been such 
a 
friend to me that there are certain things&mdash;seeing what's ahead 
of 
us&mdash;that I should like to explain"; and, noticing my surprise, he 
went on: "I mean about my people.  The state of mind in my <hi rend="italic"> 
milieu</hi> must be so remote from anything you're used to in your 
happy country. . .  But perhaps I can make you understand. . 
."</p><p> 
     I saw that what he wanted was to talk to me of the girl he 
was 
engaged to.  Mlle. Malo, left an orphan at ten, had been the ward 
of a neighbour of the Rechamps', a chap with an old name and a 
starred chateau, who had lost almost everything else at baccarat 
before he was forty, and had repented, had the gout and studied 
agriculture for the rest of his life.  The girl's father was a 
rather brilliant painter, who died young, and her mother, who 
followed him in a year or two, was a Pole: you may fancy that, 
with 
such antecedents, the girl was just the mixture to shake down 
quietly into French country life with a gouty and repentant 
guardian.  The Marquis de Corvenaire&mdash;that was his name&mdash;brought 
her down to his place, got an old maid sister to come and stay, 
and 
really, as far as one knows, brought his ward up rather decently. 
 
Now and then she used to be driven over to play with the young 
Rechamps, and Jean remembered her as an ugly little girl in a 
plaid 
frock, who used to invent wonderful games and get tired of 
playing 
them just as the other children were beginning to learn how.  But 
her domineering ways and searching questions did not meet with 
his 
mother's approval, and her visits were not encouraged.  When she 
was seventeen her guardian died and left her a little money.  The 
maiden sister had gone dotty, there was nobody to look after 
Yvonne, and she went to Paris, to an aunt, broke loose from the 
aunt when she came of age, set up her studio, travelled, painted, 
played the violin, knew lots of people; and never laid eyes on 
Jean 
de Rechamp till about a year before the war, when her guardian's 
place was sold, and she had to go down there to see about her 
interest in the property.</p><p> 
     The old Rechamps heard she was coming, but didn't ask her to 
stay.  Jean drove over to the shut-up chateau, however, and found 
Mlle. Malo lunching on a corner of the kitchen table.  She 
exclaimed: "My little Jean!" flew to him with a kiss for each 
cheek, and made him sit down and share her omelet. . .  The ugly 
little girl had shed her chrysalis&mdash;and you may fancy if he went 
back once or twice!</p><p> 
     Mlle. Malo was staying at the chateau all alone, with the 
farmer's wife to come in and cook her dinner: not a soul in the 
house at night but herself and her brindled sheep dog.  She had 
to 
be there a week, and Jean finally suggested to his people to ask 
her to Rechamp.  But at Rechamp they hesitated, coughed, looked 
away, said the spare-rooms were all upside down, and the 
valet-de-chambre laid up with the mumps, and the cook short-handed&mdash;till 
finally the irrepressible grandmother broke out: "A young girl 
who 
chooses to live alone&mdash;probably prefers to live alone!"</p><p> 
     There was a deadly silence, and Jean did not raise the 
question again; but I can imagine his blue eyes getting 
obstinate.</p><p> 
     Soon after Mlle. Malo's return to Paris he followed her and 
began to frequent the Passy studio.  The life there was unlike 
anything he had ever seen&mdash;or conceived as possible, short of the 
prairies.  He had sampled the usual varieties of French 
womankind, 
and explored most of the social layers; but he had missed the 
newest, that of the artistic-emancipated.  I don't know much 
about 
that set myself, but from his descriptions I should say they were 
a good deal like intelligent Americans, except that they don't 
seem 
to keep art and life in such water-tight compartments.  But his 
great discovery was the new girl.  Apparently he had never before 
known any but the traditional type, which predominates in the 
provinces, and still persists, he tells me, in the last 
fastnesses 
of the Faubourg St. Germain.  The girl who comes and goes as she 
pleases, reads what she likes, has opinions about what she reads, 
who talks, looks, behaves with the independence of a married 
woman&mdash;and yet has kept the Diana-freshness&mdash;think how she must 
have shaken up such a man's inherited view of things!  Mlle. 
<pb n="707"/>  Malo did far more than make Rechamp fall in love with her: 
she 
turned his world topsy-turvey, and prevented his ever again 
squeezing himself into his little old pigeon-hole of 
prejudices.</p><p> 
     Before long they confessed their love&mdash;just like any young 
couple of Anglo-Saxons&mdash;and Jean went down to Rechamp to ask 
permission to marry her.  Neither you nor I can quite enter into 
the state of mind of a young man of twenty-seven who has knocked 
about all over the globe, and been in and out of the usual 
sentimental coils&mdash;and who has to ask his parents' leave to get 
married!  Don't let us try: it's no use.  We should only end by 
picturing him as an incorrigible ninny.  But there isn't a man in 
France who wouldn't feel it his duty to take that step, as Jean 
de 
Rechamp did.  All we can do is to accept the premise and pass 
on.</p><p> 
     Well&mdash;Jean went down and asked his father and his mother and 
his old grandmother if they would permit him to marry Mlle. Malo; 
and they all with one voice said they wouldn't.  There was an 
uproar, in fact; and the old grandmother contributed the most 
piercing note to the concert.  Marry Mlle. Malo!  A young girl 
who 
lived alone!  Travelled!  Spent her time with foreigners&mdash;with 
musicians and painters!  <hi rend="italic"> A young girl!</hi>  Of course, if she 
had 
been a married woman&mdash;that is, a widow&mdash;much as they would have 
preferred a young girl for Jean, or even, if widow it had to be, 
a 
widow of another type&mdash;still, it was conceivable that, out of 
affection for him, they might have resigned themselves to his 
choice.  But a young girl&mdash;bring such a young girl to Rechamp!  
Ask 
them to receive her under the same roof with their little Simone, 
their innocent Alain. . .</p><p> 
     He had a bad hour of it; but he held his own, keeping silent 
while they screamed, and stiffening as they began to wobble from 
exhaustion.  Finally he took his mother apart, and tried to 
reason 
with her.  His arguments were not much use, but his resolution 
impressed her, and he saw it.  As for his father, nobody was 
afraid 
of Monsieur de Rechamp.  When he said: "Never&mdash;never while I 
live, 
and there is a roof on Rechamp!" they all knew he had collapsed 
inside.  But the grandmother was terrible.  She was terrible 
because she was so old, and so clever at taking advantage of it.  
She could bring on a valvular heart-attack by just sitting still 
and holding her breath, as Jean and his mother had long since 
found 
out; and she always treated them to one when things weren't going 
as she liked.  Madame de Rechamp promised Jean that she would 
intercede with her mother-in-law; but she hadn't much faith in 
the 
result, and when she came out of the old lady's room she 
whispered: 
"She's just sitting there holding her breath."</p><p> 
     The next day Jean himself advanced to the attack.  His 
grandmother was the most intelligent member of the family, and 
she 
knew he knew it, and liked him for having found it out; so when 
he 
had her alone she listened to him without resorting to any 
valvular 
tricks.  "Of course," he explained, "you're much too clever not 
to 
understand that the times have changed, and manners with them, 
and 
that what a woman was criticized for doing yesterday she is 
ridiculed for not doing today.  Nearly all the old social thou-shalt-nots have gone: intelligent people nowadays don't give a 
fig 
for them, and that simple fact has abolished them.  They only 
existed as long as there was some one left for them to scare."  
His 
grandmother listened with a sparkle of admiration in her ancient 
eyes.  "And of course," Jean pursued, "that can't be the real 
reason for your opposing my marriage&mdash;a marriage with a young 
girl 
you've always known, who has been received here&mdash;"</p><p> 
     "Ah, that's it&mdash;we've always known her!" the old lady 
snapped 
him up.</p><p> 
     "What of that?  I don't see&mdash;"</p><p> 
     "Of course you don't.  You're here so little: you don't hear 
things. . ."</p><p> 
     "What things?"</p><p> 
     "Things in the air . . . that blow about. . .  You were 
doing 
your military service at the time. . ."</p><p> 
     "At what time?"</p><p> 
     She leaned forward and laid a warning hand on his arm.  "Why 
did Corvenaire leave her all that money&mdash;<hi rend="italic"> why?"</hi></p><p> 
     "But why not&mdash;why shouldn't he?" Jean stammered, indignant.  
Then she unpacked her bag&mdash;a heap of vague insinuations, baseless 
conjectures, village tattle, all, at the last analysis, based, as 
he succeeded in proving, and making her <pb n="708"/>  own, 
on a word 
launched at random by a discharged maid-servant who had retailed 
her grievance to the cure's housekeeper.  "Oh, she does what she 
likes with Monsieur le Marquis, the young miss!  <hi rend="italic"> She</hi> 
knows how. 
. ."  On that single phrase the neighbourhood had raised a 
slander 
built of adamant.</p><p> 
     Well, I'll give you an idea of what a determined fellow 
Rechamp is, when I tell you he pulled it down&mdash;or thought he did. 
 
He kept his temper, hunted up the servant's record, proved her a 
liar and dishonest, cast grave doubts on the discretion of the 
cure's housekeeper, and poured such a flood of ridicule over the 
whole flimsy fable, and those who had believed in it, that in 
sheer 
shame-facedness at having based her objection on such grounds, 
his 
grandmother gave way, and brought his parents toppling down with 
her.</p><p> 
     All this happened a few weeks before the war, and soon 
afterward Mlle. Malo came down to Rechamp.  Jean had insisted on 
her coming: he wanted her presence there, as his betrothed, to be 
known to the neighbourhood.  As for her, she seemed delighted to 
come.  I could see from Rechamp's tone, when he reached this part 
of his story, that he rather thought I should expect its heroine 
to 
have shown a becoming reluctance&mdash;to have stood on her dignity.  
He 
was distinctly relieved when he found that I expected no such 
thing.</p><p> 
     "She's simplicity itself&mdash;it's her great quality.  Vain 
complications don't exist for her, because she doesn't see them . 
. . that's what my people can't be made to understand. . 
."</p><p> 
     I gathered from the last phrase that the visit had not been 
a 
complete success, and this explained his having let out, when he 
first told me of his fears for his family, that he was sure Mlle. 
Malo would not have remained at Rechamp if she could help it.  
Oh, 
no, decidedly, the visit was not a success. . .</p><p> 
     "You see," he explained with a half-embarrassed smile, "it 
was 
partly her fault.  Other girls as clever, but less&mdash;how shall I 
say?&mdash;less proud, would have adapted themselves, arranged things, 
avoided startling allusions.  She wouldn't stoop to that: she 
talked to my family as naturally as she did to me.  You can 
imagine 
for instance, the effect of her saying: 'One night, after a 
supper 
at Montmartre, I was walking home with two or three pals'&mdash;.  It 
was her way of affirming her convictions, and I adored her for 
it&mdash; 
but I wished she wouldn't!"</p><p> 
     And he depicted, to my joy, the neighbours rumbling over to 
call in heraldic barouches (the mothers alone&mdash;with embarrassed 
excuses for not bringing their daughters), and the agony of not 
knowing, till they were in the room, if Yvonne would receive them 
with lowered lids and folded hands, sitting by in a <hi rend="italic"> pose de 
fiancee</hi> while the elders talked; or if she would take the 
opportunity to air her views on the separation of Church and 
State, 
or the necessity of making divorce easier.  "It's not," he 
explained, "that she really takes much interest in such 
questions: 
she's much more absorbed in her music and painting.  But anything 
her eye lights on sets her mind dancing&mdash;as she said to me once: 
'It's your mother's friends' bonnets that make me stand up for 
divorce!'"  He broke off abruptly to add: "Good God, how far off 
all that nonsense seems!"

<div1 type="section" n="4" id="d6"><head>IV</head> 
 
<p> 
     THE next day we started for Rechamp, not sure if we could 
get 
through, but bound to, anyhow!  It was the coldest day we'd had, 
the sky steel, the earth iron, and a snow-wind howling down on us 
from the north.  The Vosges are splendid in winter.  In summer 
they 
are just plump puddingy hills; when the wind strips them they 
turn 
to mountains.  And we seemed to have the whole country to 
ourselves&mdash;the black firs, the blue shadows, the beech-woods 
cracking and groaning like rigging, the bursts of snowy sunlight 
from cold clouds.  Not a soul in sight except the sentinels 
guarding the railways, muffled to the eyes, or peering out of 
their 
huts of pine-boughs at the cross-roads.  Every now and then we 
passed a long string of seventy-fives, or a train of supply 
waggons 
or army ambulances, and at intervals a cavalry patrol cantered 
by, 
his cloak bellied out by the gale; but of ordinary people about 
the 
common jobs of life, not a sign.</p><p> 
     The sense of loneliness and remoteness <pb n="709"/>  
that the 
absence of the civil population produces everywhere in eastern 
France is increased by the fact that all the names and distances 
on 
the mile-stones have been scratched out and the sign-posts at the 
cross-roads thrown down.  It was done, of course, to throw the 
enemy off the track in September: and the signs have never been 
put 
back.  The result is that one is forever losing one's way, for 
the 
soldiers quartered in the district know only the names of their 
particular villages, and those on the march can tell you nothing 
about the places they are passing through.  We had got badly off 
our road several times during the trip, but on the last day's run 
Rechamp was in his own country, and knew every yard of the 
way&mdash;or 
thought he did.  We had turned off the main road, and were 
running 
along between rather featureless fields and woods, crossed by a 
good many wood-roads with nothing to distinguish them; but he 
continued to push ahead, saying: "We don't turn till we get to a 
manor-house on a stream, with a big paper-mill across the road."  
He went on to tell me that the mill-owners lived in the manor, 
and 
were old friends of his people: good old local stock, who had 
lived 
there for generations and done a lot for the 
neighbourhood.</p><p> 
     "It's queer I don't see their village-steeple from the rise. 
 
The village is just beyond the house.  How the devil could I have 
missed the turn?"  We ran on a little farther, and suddenly he 
stopped the motor with a jerk.  We were at a cross-road, with a 
stream running under the bank on our right.  The place looked 
like 
an abandoned stoneyard.  I never saw completer ruin.  To the 
left, 
a fortified gate gaped on emptiness; to the right, a mill-wheel 
hung in the stream.  Everything else was as flat as your dinner-table.</p><p> 
     "Was this what you were trying to see from that rise?" I 
asked; and I saw a tear or two running down his face.</p><p> 
     "They were the kindest people: their only son got himself 
shot 
the first month in Champagne&mdash;"</p><p> 
     He had jumped out of the car and was standing staring at the 
level waste.  "The house was there&mdash;there was a splendid lime in 
the court.  I used to sit under it and have a glass of <hi rend="italic"> vin 
gris 
de Lorraine</hi> with the old people. . .  Over there, where that 
cinder-heap is, all their children are buried."  He walked across 
to the grave-yard under a blackened wall&mdash;a bit of the apse of 
the 
vanished church&mdash;and sat down on a grave-stone.  "If the devils 
have done this <hi rend="italic"> here</hi>&mdash;so close to us," he burst out, and 
covered 
his face.</p><p> 
     An old woman walked toward us down the road.  Rechamp jumped 
up and ran to meet her.  "Why, Marie-Jeanne, what are you doing 
in 
these ruins?"  The old woman looked at him with unastonished 
eyes.  
She seemed incapable of any surprise.  "They left my house 
standing.  I'm glad to see Monsieur," she simply said.  We 
followed 
her to the one house left in the waste of stones.  It was a two-roomed cottage, propped against a cow-stable, but fairly decent, 
with a curtain in the window and a cat on the sill.  Rechamp 
caught 
me by the arm and pointed to the door-panel.  "Oberst von 
Scharlach" was scrawled on it.  He turned as white as your table-cloth, and hung on to me a minute; then he spoke to the old 
woman.  
"The officers were quartered here: that was the reason they 
spared 
your house?"</p><p> 
     She nodded.  "Yes: I was lucky.  But the gentlemen must come 
in and have a mouthful."</p><p> 
     Rechamp's finger was on the name.  "And this one&mdash;this was 
their commanding officer?"</p><p> 
     "I suppose so.  Is it somebody's name?"  She had evidently 
never speculated on the meaning of the scrawl that had saved 
her.</p><p> 
     "You remember him&mdash;their captain?  Was his name Scharlach?" 
Rechamp persisted.</p><p> 
     Under its rich weathering the old woman's face grew as pale 
as 
his.  "Yes, that was his name&mdash;I heard it often enough."</p><p> 
     "Describe him, then.  What was he like?  Tall and fair?  
They're all that&mdash;but what else?  What in particular?"</p><p> 
     She hesitated, and then said: "This one wasn't fair.  He was 
dark, and had a scar that drew up the left corner of his 
mouth."</p><p> 
     Rechamp turned to me.  "It's the same.  I heard the men 
describing him at Moulins."</p><p> 
     We followed the old woman into the <pb n="710"/>  
house, and while 
she gave us some bread and wine she told us about the wrecking of 
the village and the factory.  It was one of the most damnable 
stories I've heard yet.  Put together the worst of the typical 
horrors and you'll have a fair idea of it.  Murder, outrage, 
torture: Scharlach's programme seemed to be fairly comprehensive. 
 
She ended off by saying: "His orderly showed me a silver-mounted 
flute he always travelled with, and a beautiful paint-box mounted 
in silver too.  Before he left he sat down on my door-step and 
made 
a painting of the ruins. . ."</p><p> 
     Soon after leaving this place of death we got to the second 
lines and our troubles began.  We had to do a lot of talking to 
get 
through the lines, but what Rechamp had just seen had made him 
eloquent.  Luckily, too, the ambulance doctor, a charming fellow, 
was short of tetanus-serum, and I had some left; and while I went 
over with him to the pine-branch hut where he hid his wounded I 
explained Rechamp's case, and implored him to get us through.  
Finally it was settled that we should leave the ambulance there&mdash; 
for in the lines the ban against motors is absolute&mdash;and drive 
the 
remaining twelve miles.  A sergeant fished out of a farm-house a 
toothless old woman with a furry horse harnessed to a two-wheeled 
trap, and we started off by round-about wood-tracks.  The horse 
was 
in no hurry, nor the old lady either; for there were bits of road 
that were pretty steadily curry-combed by shell, and it was to 
everybody's interest not to cross them before twilight.  Jean de 
Rechamp's excitement seemed to have dropped: he sat beside me 
dumb 
as a fish, staring straight ahead of him.  I didn't feel 
talkative 
either, for a word the doctor had let drop had left me thinking.  
"That poor old granny mind the shells?  Not she!" he had said 
when 
our crazy chariot drove up.  "She doesn't know them from snow-flakes any more.  Nothing matters to her now, except trying to 
outwit a German.  They're all like that where Scharlach's been&mdash; 
you've heard of him?  She had only one boy&mdash;half-witted: he 
cocked 
a broom-handle at them, and they burnt him.  Oh, she'll take you 
to 
Rechamp safe enough."</p><p> 
     "Where Scharlach's been"&mdash;so he had been as close as this to 
Rechamp!  I was wondering if Jean knew it, and if that had sealed 
his lips and given him that flinty profile.  The old horse's 
woolly 
flanks jogged on under the bare branches and the old woman's bent 
back jogged in time with it.  She never once spoke or looked 
around 
at us.  "It isn't the noise we make that'll give us away," I said 
at last; and just then the old woman turned her head and pointed 
silently with the osier-twig she used as a whip.  Just ahead of 
us 
lay a heap of ruins: the wreck, apparently, of a great chateau 
and 
its dependencies.  "Lermont!" Rechamp exclaimed, turning white.  
He 
made a motion to jump out and then dropped back into the seat.  
"What's the use?" he muttered.  He leaned forward and touched the 
old woman's shoulder.</p><p> 
     "I hadn't heard of this&mdash;when did it happen?"</p><p> 
     "In September."</p><p> 
     <hi rend="italic">" They</hi> did it?"</p><p> 
     "Yes.  Our wounded were there.  It's like this everywhere in 
our country."</p><p> 
     I saw Jean stiffening himself for the next question.  "At 
Rechamp, too?"</p><p> 
     She relapsed into indifference.  "I haven't been as far as 
Rechamp."</p><p> 
     "But you must have seen people who'd been there&mdash;you must 
have 
heard."</p><p> 
     "I've heard the masters were still there&mdash;so there must be 
something standing.  Maybe though," she reflected, "they're in 
the 
cellars. . ."</p><p> 
     We continued to jog on through the dusk. 
</p> 
</div1> 
 
<div1 type="section" n="5" id="d7"> 
<head>                                 V 
</head> 
<p> 
     THERE'S the steeple!" Rechamp burst out.</p><p> 
     Through the dimness I couldn't tell which way to look; but I 
suppose in the thickest midnight he would have known where he 
was.  
He jumped from the trap and took the old horse by the bridle.  I 
made out that he was guiding us into a long village street edged 
by 
houses in which every light was extinguished.  The snow on the 
ground sent up a pale reflection, and I began to see the gabled 
outline of the houses and the steeple at the head of the street.  
The place seemed as calm and unchanged as if the sound of war had 
never reached it.  In the open <pb n="711"/>  space at the 
end of the 
village Rechamp checked the horse.</p><p> 
     "The elm&mdash;there's the old elm in front of the church!" he 
shouted in a voice like a boy's.  He ran back and caught me by 
both 
hands.  "It was true, then&mdash;nothing's touched!"  The old woman 
asked: "Is this Rechamp?" and he went back to the horse's head 
and 
turned the trap toward a tall gate between park walls.  The gate 
was barred and padlocked, and not a gleam showed through the 
shutters of the porter's lodge; but Rechamp, after listening a 
minute or two, gave a low call twice repeated, and presently the 
lodge door opened, and an old man peered out.  Well&mdash;I leave you 
to 
brush in the rest.  Old family servant, tears and hugs and so on. 
 
I know you affect to scorn the cinema, and this was it, tremolo 
and 
all.  Hang it!  This war's going to teach us not to be afraid of 
the obvious.</p><p> 
     We piled into the trap and drove down a long avenue to the 
house.  Black as the grave, of course; but in another minute the 
door opened, and there, in the hall, was another servant, 
screening 
a light&mdash;and then more doors opened on another cinema-scene: fine 
old drawing-room with family portraits, shaded lamp, domestic 
group 
about the fire.  They evidently thought it was the servant coming 
to announce dinner, and not a head turned at our approach.  I 
could 
see them all over Jean's shoulder: a grey-haired lady knitting 
with 
stiff fingers, an old gentleman with a high nose and a weak chin 
sitting in a big carved armchair and looking more like a portrait 
than the portraits; a pretty girl at his feet, with a dog's head 
in 
her lap, and another girl, who had a Red Cross on her sleeve, at 
the table with a book.  She had been reading aloud in a rich 
veiled 
voice, and broke off her last phrase to say: "Dinner. . ."  Then 
she looked up and saw Jean.  Her dark face remained perfectly 
calm, 
but she lifted her hand in a just perceptible gesture of warning, 
and instantly understanding he drew back and pushed the servant 
forward in his place.</p><p> 
     "Madame la Comtesse&mdash;it is some one outside asking for 
Mademoiselle."</p><p> 
     The dark girl jumped up and ran out into the hall.  I 
remember 
wondering: "Is it because she wants to have him to herself 
first&mdash; 
or because she's afraid of their being startled?"  I wished 
myself 
out of the way, but she took no notice of me, and going straight 
to 
Jean flung her arms about him.  I was behind him and could see 
her 
hands about his neck, and her brown fingers tightly locked.  
There 
wasn't much doubt about those two. . .</p><p> 
     The next minute she caught sight of me, and I was being 
rapidly tested by a pair of the finest eyes I ever saw&mdash;I don't 
apply the term to their setting, though that was fine too, but to 
the look itself, a look at once warm and resolute, all-promising 
and all-penetrating.  I really can't do with fewer adjectives. . 
.</p><p> 
     Rechamp explained me, and she was full of thanks and 
welcome; 
not excessive, but&mdash;well, I don't know&mdash;eloquent!  She gave every 
intonation all it could carry, and without the least emphasis: 
that's the wonder.</p><p> 
     She went back to "prepare" the parents, as they say in 
melodrama; and in a minute or two we followed.  What struck me at 
first was that these insignificant and inadequate people had the 
command of the grand gesture&mdash;had <hi rend="italic"> la ligne</hi>.  The mother 
had 
laid aside her knitting&mdash;<hi rend="italic"> not</hi> dropped it&mdash;and stood 
waiting with 
open arms.  But even in clasping her son she seemed to include me 
in her welcome.  I don't know how to describe it; but they never 
let me feel that I was in the way.  I suppose that's part of what 
you call distinction; knowing instinctively how to deal with 
unusual moments.</p><p> 
     All the while, I was looking about me at the fine secure old 
room, in which nothing seemed altered or disturbed, the portraits 
smiling from the walls, the servants beaming in the doorway&mdash;and 
wondering how such things could have survived in the trail of 
death 
and havoc we had been following.</p><p> 
     The same thought had evidently struck Jean, for he dropped 
his 
sister's hand and turned to gaze about him too.</p><p> 
     "Then nothing's touched&mdash;<hi rend="italic"> nothing?</hi>  I don't 
understand," he 
stammered.</p><p> 
     Monsieur de Rechamp raised himself majestically from his 
chair, crossed the room and lifted Yvonne Malo's hand to his 
lips.  
"Nothing is touched&mdash;thanks to this hand and this brain." 
<pb n="712"/> </p><p> 
     Madame de Rechamp was shining on her son through tears.  
"Ah, 
yes&mdash;we owe it all to Yvonne."</p><p> 
     "All, all!  Grandmamma will tell you!" Simone chimed in; and 
Yvonne, brushing aside their praise with a half-impatient laugh, 
said to her betrothed: "But your grandmother!  You must go up to 
her at once."</p><p> 
     A wonderful specimen, that grandmother: I was taken to see 
her 
after dinner.  She sat by the fire in a bare panelled bedroom, 
bolt 
upright in an armchair with ears, a knitting-table at her elbow 
with a shaded candle on it.  She was even more withered and 
ancient 
than she looked in her photograph, and I judge she'd never been 
pretty; but she somehow made me feel as if I'd got through with 
prettiness.  I don't know exactly what she reminded me of: a 
dried 
bouquet, or something rich and clovy that had turned brittle 
through long keeping in a sandal-wood box.  I suppose her sandal-wood box had been Good Society.  Well, I had a rare evening with 
her.  Jean and his parents were called down to see the cure, who 
had hurried over to the chateau when he heard of the young man's 
arrival; and the old lady asked me to stay on and chat with her.  
She related their experiences with uncanny detachment, seeming 
chiefly to resent the indignity of having been made to descend 
into 
the cellar&mdash;"to avoid French shells, if you'll believe it: the 
Germans had the decency not to bombard us," she observed 
impartially.  I was so struck by the absence of rancour in her 
tone 
that finally, out of sheer curiosity, I made an allusion to the 
horror of having the enemy under one's roof.  "Oh, I might almost 
say I didn't see them," she returned.  "I never go downstairs any 
longer; and they didn't do me the honour of coming beyond my 
door.  
A glance sufficed them&mdash;<hi rend="italic"> une vielle femme comme moi!"</hi> she 
added 
with a phosphorescent gleam of coquetry.</p><p> 
     "But they searched the chateau, surely?"</p><p> 
     "Oh, a mere form; they were <hi rend="italic"> tres bien&mdash;tres bien</hi>," 
she 
almost snapped at me.  "There was a first moment, of course, when 
we feared it might be hard to get Monsieur de Rechamp away with 
my 
young grandson; but Mlle. Malo managed that very cleverly.  They 
slipped off while the officers were dining."  She looked at me 
with 
the smile of some arch old lady in a Louis XV pastel.  "My 
grandson 
Jean's fiancee is a very clever young woman: in my time no young 
girl would have been so sure of herself, so cool and quick.  
After 
all, there is something to be said for the new way of bringing up 
girls.  My poor daughter-in-law, at Yvonne's age, was a bleating 
baby: she is so still, at times.  The convent doesn't develop 
character.  I'm glad Yvonne was not brought up in a convent."  
And this champion of tradition smiled on me more intensely.</p><p> 
     Little by little I got from her the story of the German 
approach: the distracted fugitives pouring in from the villages 
north of Rechamp, the sound of distant cannonading, and suddenly, 
the next afternoon, after a reassuring lull, the sight of a 
single 
spiked helmet at the end of the drive.  In a few minutes a dozen 
followed: mostly officers; then all at once the place hummed with 
them.  There were supply waggons and motors in the court, bundles 
of hay, stacks of rifles, artillery-men unharnessing and rubbing 
down their horses.  The crowd was hot and thirsty, and in a 
moment 
the old lady, to her amazement, saw wine and cider being handed 
about by the Rechamp servants.  "Or so at least I was told," she 
added, correcting herself, "for it's not my habit to look out of 
the window.  I simply sat here and waited."  Her seat, as she 
spoke, might have been a curule chair.</p><p> 
     Downstairs, it appeared, Mlle. Malo had instantly taken her 
measures.  <hi rend="italic"> She</hi> didn't sit and wait.  Surprised in the 
garden 
with Simone, she had made the girl walk quietly back to the house 
and receive the officers with her on the doorstep.  The officer 
in 
command&mdash;captain, or whatever he was&mdash;had arrived in a bad 
temper, 
cursing and swearing, and growling out menaces about spies.  The 
day was intensely hot, and possibly he had had too much wine.  At 
any rate Mlle. Malo had known how to "put him in his place"; and 
when he and the other officers entered they found the 
dining-table 
set out with refreshing drinks and cigars, melons, strawberries 
and 
iced coffee.  "The clever creature!  She even remembered 
<pb n="713"/>  
that they liked whipped cream with their coffee!"</p><p> 
     The effect had been miraculous.  The captain&mdash;what was his 
name?  Yes, Charlot, Charlot&mdash;Captain Charlot had been specially 
complimentary on the subject of the whipped cream and the cigars. 
 
Then he asked to see the other members of the family, and Mlle. 
Malo told him there were only two&mdash;two old women!  "He made a 
face 
at that, and said all the same he should like to meet them; and 
she 
answered: 'One is your hostess, the Comtesse de Rechamp, who is 
ill 
in bed'&mdash;for my poor daughter-in-law was lying in bed paralyzed 
with rheumatism&mdash;'and the other her mother-in-law, a very old 
lady 
who never leaves her room.'"</p><p> 
     "But aren't there any men in the family?" he had then asked; 
and she had said: "Oh yes&mdash;two.  The Comte de Rechamp and his 
son."</p><p> 
     "And where are they?"</p><p> 
     "In England.  Monsieur de Rechamp went a month ago to take 
his 
son on a trip."</p><p> 
     The officer said: "I was told they were here today"; and 
Mlle. 
Malo replied: "You had better have the house searched and satisfy 
yourself."</p><p> 
     He laughed and said: "The idea <hi rend="italic"> had</hi> occurred to me."  
She 
laughed also, and sitting down at the piano struck a few chords.  
Captain Charlot, who had his foot on the threshold, turned back&mdash; 
Simone had described the scene to her grandmother afterward.  
"Some 
of the brutes, it seems, are musical," the old lady explained; 
"and 
this was one of them.  While he was listening, some soldiers 
appeared in the court carrying another who seemed to be wounded.  
It turned out afterward that he'd been climbing a garden wall 
after 
fruit, and cut himself on the broken glass at the top; but the 
blood was enough&mdash;they raised the usual dreadful outcry about an 
ambush, and a lieutenant clattered into the room where Mlle. Malo 
sat playing Stravinsky."  The old lady paused for her effect, and 
I was conscious of giving her all she wanted.</p><p> 
     "Well&mdash;?"</p><p> 
     "Will you believe it?  It seems she looked at her watch-bracelet and said: 'Do you gentlemen dress for dinner?  <hi rend="italic"> I</hi> 
do&mdash; 
but we've still time for a little Moussorgsky'&mdash;or whatever wild 
names they call themselves&mdash;'if you'll make those people outside 
hold their tongues.'  Our captain looked at her again, laughed, 
gave an order that sent the lieutenant right about, and sat down 
beside her at the piano.  Imagine my stupour, dear sir: the 
drawing-room is directly under this room, and in a moment I heard 
two voices coming up to me.  Well, I won't conceal from you that 
his was the finest.  But then I always adored a barytone."  She 
folded her shrivelled hands among their laces.  "After that, the 
Germans were <hi rend="italic"> tres bien&mdash;tres bien</hi>.  They stayed two days, 
and 
there was nothing to complain of.  Indeed, when the second 
detachment came, a week later, they never even entered the gates. 
 
Orders had been left that they should be quartered elsewhere.  Of 
course we were lucky in happening on a man of the world like 
Captain Charlot."</p><p> 
     "Yes, very lucky.  It's odd, though, his having a French 
name."</p><p> 
     "Very odd.  It probably accounts for his breeding," she 
answered placidly; and left me marvelling at the happy remoteness 
of old age.

<p> 
     THE next morning early Jean de Rechamp came to my room.  I 
was 
struck at once by the change in him: he had lost his first glow, 
and seemed nervous and hesitating.  I knew what he had come for: 
to 
ask me to postpone our departure for another twenty-four hours.  
By 
rights we should have been off that morning; but there had been a 
sharp brush a few kilometres away, and a couple of poor devils 
had 
been brought to the chateau whom it would have been death to 
carry 
farther that day and criminal not to hurry to a base hospital the 
next morning.  "We've simply <hi rend="italic"> got</hi> to stay till to-morrow: 
you're 
in luck," I said laughing.</p><p> 
     He laughed back, but with a frown that made me feel I had 
been 
a brute to speak in that way of a respite due to such a 
cause.</p><p> 
     "The men will pull through, you know&mdash;trust Mlle. Malo for 
that!" I said.</p><p> 
     His frown did not lift.  He went to the window and drummed 
on 
the pane.</p><p> 
     "Do you see that breach in the wall, <pb n="714"/>  
down there behind 
the trees?  It's the only scratch the place has got.  And think 
of 
Lermont!  It's incredible&mdash;simply incredible!"</p><p> 
     "But it's like that everywhere, isn't it?  Everything 
depends 
on the officer in command."</p><p> 
     "Yes: that's it, I suppose.  I haven't had time to get a 
consecutive account of what happened: they're all too excited.  
Mlle. Malo is the only person who can tell me exactly how things 
went."  He swung about on me.  "Look here, it sounds absurd, what 
I'm asking; but try to get me an hour alone with her, will 
you?"</p><p> 
     I stared at the request, and he went on, still 
half-laughing: 
"You see, they all hang on me; my father and mother, Simone, the 
cure, the servants.  The whole village is coming up presently: 
they 
want to stuff their eyes full of me.  It's natural enough, after 
living here all these long months cut off from everything.  But 
the 
result is I haven't said two words to her yet."</p><p> 
     "Well, you shall," I declared; and with an easier smile he 
turned to hurry down to a mass of thanksgiving which the cure was 
to celebrate in the private chapel.  "My parents wanted it," he 
explained; "and after that the whole village will be upon us.  
But 
later&mdash;"</p><p> 
     "Later I'll effect a diversion; I swear I will," I assured 
him. 
</p><p> 
     By daylight, decidedly, Mlle. Malo was less handsome than in 
the evening.  It was my first thought as she came toward me, that 
afternoon, under the limes.  Jean was still indoors, with his 
people, receiving the village; I rather wondered she hadn't 
stayed 
there with him.  Theoretically, her place was at his side; but I 
knew she was a young woman who didn't live by rule, and she had 
already struck me as having a distaste for superfluous 
expenditures 
of feeling.</p><p> 
     Yes, she was less effective by day.  She looked older, for 
one 
thing; her face was pinched, and a little sallow, and for the 
first 
time I noticed that her cheek-bones were too high.  Her eyes, 
too, 
had lost their velvet depth: fine eyes still, but not 
unfathomable.  
But the smile with which she greeted me was charming: it ran over 
her tired face like a lamp-lighter kindling flames as he 
runs.</p><p> 
     "I was looking for you," she said.  "Shall we have a little 
talk?  The reception is sure to last another hour: every one of 
the 
villagers is going to tell just what happened to him or her when 
the Germans came."</p><p> 
     "And you've run away from the ceremony?"</p><p> 
     "I'm a trifle tired of hearing the same adventures retold," 
she said, still smiling.</p><p> 
     "But I thought there <hi rend="italic"> were</hi> no adventures&mdash;that that 
was the 
wonder of it?"</p><p> 
     She shrugged.  "It makes their stories a little dull, at any 
rate; we've not a hero or a martyr to show."  She had strolled 
farther from the house as we talked, steering me in the direction 
of a bare horse-chestnut walk that led toward the part.</p><p> 
     "Of course Jean's got to listen to it all, poor boy; but <hi rend="italic"> 
I</hi> 
needn't," she explained.</p><p> 
     I didn't know exactly what to answer and we walked on a 
little 
way in silence; then she said: "If you'd carried him off this 
morning he would have escaped all this fuss."  After a pause she 
added slowly: "On the whole, it might have been as well."</p><p> 
     "To carry him off?"</p><p> 
     "Well, yes."  She stopped and looked at me.  "I wish you <hi rend="italic"> 
would</hi>."</p><p> 
     "Would?&mdash;Now?"</p><p> 
     "Yes, now: as soon as you can.  He's really not strong yet&mdash; 
he's drawn and nervous."  ("So are you," I thought 
parenthetically.)  "And the excitement is greater than you can 
perhaps imagine&mdash;"</p><p> 
     I gave her back her look.  "Why, I think I <hi rend="italic"> can</hi> 
imagine. . 
."</p><p> 
     She coloured up through her sallow skin and then laughed 
away 
her blush.  "Oh, I don't mean the excitement of seeing <hi rend="italic"> 
me!</hi>  But 
his parents, his grandmother, the cure, all the old 
associations&mdash;"</p><p> 
     I considered for a moment; then I said: "As a matter of 
fact, 
you're about the only person he <hi rend="italic"> hasn't</hi> seen."</p><p> 
     She checked a quick answer on her lips, and for a moment or 
two we faced each other silently.  A sudden sense of intimacy, of 
complicity almost, came over me.  What was it the girl's silence 
was crying out to me?</p><p> 
     "If I take him away now he won't have seen you at all," I 
continued.</p><p> 
     She stood under the bare trees, keeping her eyes on me.  
"Then 
take him away <pb n="715"/>  now!" she retorted; and as she 
spoke I saw 
her face change, decompose into deadly apprehension and as 
quickly 
regain its usual calm.  From where she stood she faced the 
courtyard, and glancing in the same direction I saw the throng of 
villagers coming out of the chateau.  "Take him away&mdash;take him 
away 
at once!" she passionately commanded; and the next minute Jean de 
Rechamp detached himself from the group and began to limp down 
the 
walk in our direction.</p><p> 
     What was I to do?  I can't exaggerate the sense of urgency 
Mlle. Malo's appeal gave me, or my faith in her sincerity.  No 
one 
who had seen her meeting with Rechamp the night before could have 
doubted her feeling for him: if she wanted him away it was not 
because she did not delight in his presence.  Even now, as he 
approached, I saw her face veiled by a faint mist of emotion: it 
was like watching a fruit ripen under a midsummer sun.  But she 
turned sharply from the house and began to walk on.</p><p> 
     "Can't you give me a hint of your reason?" I suggested as I 
followed.</p><p> 
     "My reason?  I've given it!"  I suppose I looked 
incredulous, 
for she added in a lower voice: "I don't want him to hear&mdash;yet&mdash; 
about all the horrors."</p><p> 
     "The horrors?  I thought there had been none here."</p><p> 
     "All around us&mdash;"  Her voice became a whisper.  "Our friends 
. . . our neighbours . . . every one. . ."</p><p> 
     "He can hardly avoid hearing of that, can he?  And besides, 
since you're all safe and happy. . .  Look here," I broke off, 
"he's coming after us.  Don't we look as if we were running 
away?"</p><p> 
     She turned around, suddenly paler; and in a stride or two 
Rechamp was at our side.  He was pale too; and before I could 
find 
a pretext for slipping away he had begun to speak.  But I saw at 
once that he didn't know or care if I was there.</p><p> 
     "What was the name of the officer in command who was 
quartered 
here?" he asked, looking straight at the girl.</p><p> 
     She raised her eye-brows slightly.  "Do you mean to say that 
after listening for three hours to every inhabitant of Rechamp 
you 
haven't found that out?"</p><p> 
     "They all call him something different.  My grandmother says 
he had a French name: she calls him Charlot."</p><p> 
     "Your grandmother was never taught German: his name was the 
Oberst von Scharlach."  She did not remember my presence either: 
the two were still looking straight in each other's eyes.</p><p> 
     Rechamp had grown white to the lips: he was rigid with the 
effort to control himself.</p><p> 
     "Why didn't you tell me it was Scharlach who was here?" he 
brought out at last in a low voice.</p><p> 
     She turned her eyes in my direction.  "I was just explaining 
to Mr. Greer&mdash;"</p><p> 
     "To Mr. Greer?"  He looked at me too, half-angrily.</p><p> 
     "I know the stories that are about," she continued quietly; 
"and I was saying to your friend that, since we had been so happy 
as to be spared, it seemed useless to dwell on what has happened 
elsewhere."</p><p> 
     "Damn what happened elsewhere!  I don't yet know what 
happened 
here."</p><p> 
     I put a hand on his arm.  Mlle. Malo was looking hard at me, 
but I wouldn't let her see I knew it.  "I'm going to leave you to 
hear the whole story now," I said to Rechamp.</p><p> 
     "But there isn't any story for him to hear!" she broke in.  
She pointed at the serene front of the chateau, looking out 
across 
its gardens to the unscarred fields.  "We're safe; the place is 
untouched.  Why brood on other horrors&mdash;horrors we were powerless 
to help?"</p><p> 
     Rechamp held his ground doggedly.  "But the man's name is a 
curse and an abomination.  Wherever he went he spread 
ruin."</p><p> 
     "So they say.  Mayn't there be a mistake?  Legends grow up 
so 
quickly in these dreadful times.  Here&mdash;" she looked about her 
again at the peaceful scene&mdash;"here he behaved as you see.  For 
heaven's sake be content with that!"</p><p> 
     "Content?"  He passed his hand across his forehead.  "I'm 
blind with joy . . . or should be, if only . . ."</p><p> 
     She looked at me entreatingly, almost desperately, and I 
took 
hold of Rechamp's arm with a warning pressure.  "My dear fellow, 
don't you see that Mlle. Malo has been under a great strain?  <hi rend="italic"> 
La 
joie fait peur</hi>&mdash;that's the trouble with both of you!"</p><p> 
     He lowered his head.  "Yes, I suppose it is."  He took her 
hand and kissed it. <pb n="716"/>  "I beg your pardon.  
Greer's right: 
we're both on edge."</p><p> 
     "Yes: I'll leave you for a little while, if you and Mr. 
Greer 
will excuse me."  She included us both in a quiet look that 
seemed 
to me extremely noble, and walked slowly away toward the chateau. 
 
Rechamp stood gazing after her for a moment; then he dropped down 
on one of the benches at the edge of the path.  He covered his 
face 
with his hands.  "Scharlach&mdash;Scharlach!" I heard him 
repeat.</p><p> 
     We sat there side by side for ten minutes or more without 
speaking.  Finally I said: "Look here, Rechamp&mdash;she's right and 
you're wrong.  I shall be sorry I brought you here if you don't 
see 
it before it's too late."</p><p> 
     His face was still hidden; but presently he dropped his 
hands 
and answered me.  "I do see.  She's saved everything for me&mdash;my 
people and my house, and the ground we're standing on.  And I 
worship it because she walks on it!"</p><p> 
     "And so do your people: the war's done that for you, 
anyhow," 
I reminded him.

<head>                         VII</head> 
<p> 
     THE morning after we were off before dawn.  Our time 
allowance 
was up, and it was thought advisable, on account of our wounded, 
to 
slip across the exposed bit of road in the dark.</p><p> 
     Mlle. Malo was downstairs when we started, pale in her white 
dress, but calm and active.  We had borrowed a farmer's cart in 
which our two men could be laid on a mattress, and she had 
stocked 
our trap with food and remedies.  Nothing seemed to have been 
forgotten.  While I was settling the men I suppose Rechamp turned 
back into the hall to bid her good-bye; anyhow, when she followed 
him out a moment later he looked quieter and less strained.  He 
had 
taken leave of his parents and his sister upstairs, and Yvonne 
Malo 
stood alone in the dark doorway, watching us as we drove 
away.</p><p> 
     There was not much talk between us during our slow drive 
back 
to the lines.  We had to go at a snail's pace, for the roads were 
rough; and there was time for meditation.  I knew well enough 
what 
my companion was thinking about and my own thoughts ran on the 
same 
lines.  Though the story of the German occupation of Rechamp had 
been retold to us a dozen times the main facts did not vary.  
There 
were little discrepancies of detail, and gaps in the narrative 
here 
and there; but all the household, from the astute ancestress to 
the 
last bewildered pantry-boy, were at one in saying that Mlle. 
Malo's 
coolness and courage had saved the chateau and the village.  The 
officer in command had arrived full of threats and insolence: 
Mlle. 
Malo had placated and disarmed him, turned his suspicions to 
ridicule, entertained him and his comrades at dinner, and 
contrived 
during that time&mdash;or rather while they were making music 
afterward 
(which they did for half the night, it seemed)&mdash;that Monsieur de 
Rechamp and Alain should slip out of the cellar in which they had 
been hidden, gain the end of the gardens through an old hidden 
passage, and get off in the darkness.  Meanwhile Simone had been 
safe upstairs with her mother and grandmother, and none of the 
officers lodged in the chateau had&mdash;after a first hasty 
inspection&mdash;set foot in any part of the house but the wing 
assigned 
to them.  On the third morning they had left, and Scharlach, 
before 
going, had put in Mlle. Malo's hands a letter requesting whatever 
officer should follow him to show every consideration to the 
family 
of the Comte de Rechamp, and if possible&mdash;owing to the grave 
illness of the Countess&mdash;avoid taking up quarters in the chateau: 
a request which had been scrupulously observed.</p><p> 
     Such were the amazing but undisputed facts over which 
Rechamp 
and I, in our different ways, were now pondering.  He hardly 
spoke, 
and when he did it was only to make some casual reference to the 
road or to our wounded soldiers; but all the while I sat at his 
side I kept hearing the echo of the question he was inwardly 
asking 
himself, and hoping to God he wouldn't put it to me. . .</p><p> 
     It was nearly noon when we finally reached the lines, and 
the 
men had to have a rest before we could start again; but a couple 
of 
hours later we landed them safely at the base hospital.  From 
there 
we had intended to go back to Paris; but as we were starting 
there 
came an unexpected summons to another point of the  
<pb n="717"/>  front, 
where there had been a successful night-attack, and a lot of 
Germans taken in a blown-up trench.  The place was fifty miles 
away, and off my beat, but the number of wounded on both sides 
was 
exceptionally heavy, and all the available ambulances had already 
started.  An urgent call had come for more, and there was nothing 
for it but to go; so we went.</p><p> 
     We found things in a bad mess at the second line shanty-hospital where they were dumping the wounded as fast as they 
could 
bring them in.  At first we were told that none were fit to be 
carried farther that night; and after we had done what we could 
we 
went off to hunt up a shake-down in the village.  But a few 
minutes 
later an orderly overtook us with a message from the surgeon.  
There was a German with an abdominal wound who was in a bad way, 
but might be saved by an operation if he could be got back to the 
base before midnight.  Would we take him at once and then come 
back 
for others?</p><p> 
     There is only one answer to such requests, and a few minutes 
later we were back at the hospital, and the wounded man was being 
carried out on a stretcher.  In the shaky lantern gleam I caught 
a 
glimpse of a livid face and a torn uniform, and saw that he was 
an 
officer, and nearly done for.  Rechamp had climbed to the box, 
and 
seemed not to be noticing what was going on at the back of the 
motor.  I understood that he loathed the job, and wanted not to 
see 
the face of the man we were carrying; so when we had got him 
settled I jumped into the ambulance beside him and called out to 
Rechamp that we were ready.  A second later an <hi rend="italic"> infirmier</hi> 
ran up 
with a little packet and pushed it into my hand.  "His papers," 
he 
explained.  I pocketed them and pulled the door shut, and we were 
off.</p><p> 
     The man lay motionless on his back, conscious, but 
desperately 
weak.  Once I turned my pocket-lamp on him, and saw that he was 
young&mdash;about thirty&mdash;with damp dark hair and a thin face.  He had 
received a flesh-wound above the eyes, and his forehead was 
bandaged, but the rest of the face uncovered.  As the light fell 
on 
him he lifted his eyelids and looked at me: his look was 
inscrutable.</p><p> 
     For half an hour or so I sat there in the dark, the sense of 
that face pressing close on me.  It was a damnable face&mdash;meanly 
handsome, basely proud.  In my one glimpse of it I had seen that 
the man was suffering atrociously, but as we slid along through 
the 
night he made no sound.  At length the motor stopped with a 
violent 
jerk that drew a single moan from him.  I turned the light on 
him, 
but he lay perfectly still, lips and lids shut, making no sign; 
and 
I jumped out and ran round to the front to see what had 
happened.</p><p> 
     The motor had stopped for lack of gasolene and was stock 
still 
in the deep mud.  Rechamp muttered something about a leak in his 
tank.  As he bent over it, the lantern flame struck up into his 
face, which was set and business-like.  It struck me vaguely that 
he showed no particular surprise.</p><p> 
     "What's to be done?" I asked.</p><p> 
     "I think I can tinker it up; but we've got to have more 
essence to go on with."</p><p> 
     I stared at him in despair: it was a good hour's walk back 
to 
the lines, and we weren't so sure of getting any gasolene when we 
got there!  But there was no help for it; and as Rechamp was dead 
lame, no alternative but for me to go.</p><p> 
     I opened the ambulance door, gave another look at the 
motionless man inside and took out a remedy which I handed over 
to 
Rechamp with a word of explanation.  "You know how to give a 
hypo?  
Keep a close eye on him and pop this in if you see a change&mdash;not 
otherwise."</p><p> 
     He nodded.  "Do you suppose he'll die?" he asked below his 
breath.</p><p> 
     "No, I don't.  If we get him to the hospital before morning 
I 
think he'll pull through."</p><p> 
     "Oh, all right."  He unhooked one of the motor lanterns and 
handed it over to me.  "I'll do my best," he said as I turned 
away.</p><p> 
     Getting back to the lines through that pitch-black forest, 
and 
finding somebody to bring the gasolene back for me was about the 
weariest job I ever tackled.  I couldn't imagine why it wasn't 
daylight when we finally got to the place where I had left the 
motor.  It seemed to me as if I had been gone twelve hours when I 
finally caught sight of the grey bulk of the car through the 
thinning darkness.</p><p> 
     Rechamp came forward to meet us, and took hold of my arm as 
I 
was opening the  
<pb n="718"/>  door of the car.  "The man's 
dead," he 
said.</p><p> 
     I had lifted up my pocket-lamp, and its light fell on his 
face, which was perfectly composed, and seemed less gaunt and 
drawn 
than at any time since we had started for Rechamp.</p><p> 
     "Dead?  Why&mdash;how?  What happened?  Did you give him the 
hypodermic?" I stammered, taken aback.</p><p> 
     "No time to.  He died in a minute."</p><p> 
     "How do you know he did?  Were you with him?"</p><p> 
     "Of course I was with him," Rechamp retorted, with a sudden 
harshness that made me realize I had grown harsh myself.  But I 
had 
been almost sure the man wasn't anywhere near death when I left 
him.  I opened the door of the ambulance and climbed in with my 
lantern.  He didn't appear to have moved, but he was dead sure 
enough&mdash;had been for two or three hours, by the feel of him.  It 
must have happened not long after I left. . .  Well, I'm not a 
doctor, anyhow. . .</p><p> 
     I don't know that Rechamp and I exchanged a word on the rest 
of that run.  But it was my fault and not his if we didn't.  By 
the 
mere rub of his sleeve against mine as we sat side by side on the 
motor I knew he was conscious of no bar between us: he had 
somehow 
got back, in the night's interval, to a state of wholesome 
stolidity, while I, on the contrary, was tingling all over with 
exposed nerves.</p><p> 
     I was glad enough when we got back to the base at last, and 
the grim load we carried was lifted out and taken into the 
hospital.  Rechamp waited in the courtyard beside his car, 
lighting 
a cigarette in the cold early sunlight; but I followed the 
bearers 
and the surgeon into the white-washed room where the dead man was 
laid out to be undressed.  I had a burning spot at the pit of my 
stomach while his clothes were ripped off him and the bandages 
undone: I couldn't take my eyes from the surgeon's face.  But the 
surgeon, with a big batch of wounded on his hands, was probably 
thinking more of the living than the dead; and besides, we were 
near the front, and the body before him was an enemy's.</p><p> 
     He finished his examination and scribbled something in a 
note-book.  "Death must have taken place nearly five hours ago," he 
merely remarked: it was the conclusion I had already come to 
myself.</p><p> 
     "And how about the papers?" the surgeon continued.  "You 
have 
them, I suppose?  This way, please."</p><p> 
     We left the half-stripped body on the blood-stained 
oil-cloth 
and he led me into an office where a functionary sat behind a 
littered desk.</p><p> 
     "The papers?  Thank you.  You haven't examined them?  Let us 
see, then."</p><p> 
     I handed over the leather note-case I had thrust into my 
pocket the evening before, and saw for the first time its silver-edged corners and the coronet in one of them.  The official took 
out the papers and spread them on the desk between us.  I watched 
him absently while he did so.</p><p> 
     Suddenly he uttered an exclamation.  "Ah&mdash;that's a haul!" he 
said, and pushed a bit of paper toward me.  On it was engraved 
the 
name: Oberst Graf Benno von Scharlach. . .</p><p> 
     "A good riddance," said the surgeon over my shoulder. . .</p> 
<p> 
     I went back to the courtyard and saw Rechamp still smoking 
his 
cigarette in the cold sunlight.  I don't suppose I'd been in the 
hospital ten minutes; but I felt as old as Methuselah.</p><p> 
     My friend greeted me with a smile.  "Ready for breakfast?" 
he said good-humouredly; and a little chill ran down my spine. . .  
But I said: "Oh, all right&mdash;come along. . ."</p><p> 
     For, after all, I <hi rend="italic"> knew</hi> there wasn't a paper of any 
sort on 
that man when he was lifted into my ambulance the night before: 
the 
French officials attend to their business too carefully for me 
not 
to have been sure of that.  And there wasn't the least shred of 
evidence to prove that he hadn't died of his wounds during the 
unlucky delay in the forest; or that Rechamp had known his tank 
was 
leaking when we started out from the lines.</p><p> 
     "I could do with a <hi rend="italic"> cafe complet</hi>, couldn't you?" 
Rechamp suggested, looking straight at me with his good blue eyes; and 
arm in arm we started off to hunt for the nearest hotel. . .</p>
