I will bring fire to thee. </l><bibl>EURIPIDES, <hi rend="italic">Andromache</hi> <lb/> </bibl></epigraph>


<p>EIROS.  Why do you call me Eiros? 
</p><p>CHARMION.  So henceforth will you always be called.  You 
must forget, too, <hi rend="italic">my</hi> earthly name, and speak to me as Charmion. 
</p><p>EIROS.  This is indeed no dream! 
</p><p>CHARMION.  Dreams are with us no more; but of these 
mysteries anon.  I rejoice to see you looking life-like and 
rational.  The film of the shadow has already passed from off 
your eyes.  Be of heart, and fear nothing.  Your allotted days of 
stupor have expired; and, to-morrow, I will myself induct you 
into the full joys and wonders of your novel existence. 
</p><p>EIROS.  True, I feel no stupor, none at all.  The wild 
sickness and the terrible darkness have left me, and I hear no 
longer that mad, rushing, horrible sound, 'like the voice of many 
waters'.  Yet my senses are bewildered, Charmion, with the 
keenness of their perception of the <hi rend="italic">new</hi>. 
</p><p>CHARMION.  A few days will remove all this; &mdash; but I fully 
understand you, and feel for you.  It is now ten earthly years 
since I underwent what you undergo, yet the remembrance of it 
hangs by me still.  You have now suffered all of pain, however, 
which you will suffer in Aidenn. 
</p><p>EIROS.  In Aidenn? 
</p><p>CHARMION.  In Aidenn. 
</p><p>EIROS.  Oh, God! &mdash; pity me, Charmion! &mdash; I am overburdened with 
the majesty of all things &mdash; of the unknown now known &mdash; 
<pb n="124"/>  
of the 
speculative Future merged in the august and certain Present. 
</p><p>CHARMION.  Grapple not now with such thoughts.  To-morrow we 
will speak of this.  Your mind wavers, and its agitations will 
find relief in the exercise of simple memories.  Look not around, 
nor forward &mdash; but back.  I am burning with anxiety to hear the 
details of that stupendous event which threw you among us.  Tell 
me of it.  Let us converse of familiar things, in the old 
familiar language of the world which has so fearfully perished. 
</p><p>EIROS.  Most fearfully, fearfully! &mdash; this is indeed no dream. 
</p><p>CHARMION.  Dreams are no more.  Was I much mourned, my 
Eiros? 
</p><p>EIROS.  Mourned, Charmion? &mdash; oh, deeply.  To that last hour 
of all, there hung a cloud of intense gloom and devout sorrow 
over your household. 
</p><p>CHARMION.  And that last hour &mdash; speak of it.  Remember that, 
beyond the naked fact of the catastrophe itself, I know nothing. 
When, coming out from among mankind, I passed into Night through 
the Grave &mdash; at that period, if I remember aright, the calamity 
which overwhelmed you was utterly unanticipated.  But, indeed, I 
knew little of the speculative philosophy of the day. 
</p><p>EIROS.  The individual calamity was, as you say, entirely 
unanticipated; but analogous misfortunes had been long a subject 
of discussion with astronomers.  I need scarce tell you, my 
friend, that even when you left us, men had agreed to understand 
those passages in the most holy writings which speak of the final 
destruction of all things by fire, as having reference to the orb 
of the earth alone.  But in regard to the immediate agency of the 
ruin, speculation had been at fault from that epoch in 
astronomical knowledge in which the comets were divested of the 
terrors of flame.  The very moderate density of these bodies had 
been well established.  They had been observed to pass among the 
satellites of Jupiter, without bringing about any sensible 
alteration either in the masses or in the orbits of these 
secondary planets.  We had long regarded the wanderers as vapoury 
creations of inconceivable tenuity, and as altogether incapable 
of doing injury to our substantial globe, even in the event of 
contact.  But contact was not in any degree dreaded; for the 
elements of all the comets were accurately known.  That among 
<hi rend="italic">them</hi> we should look for the agency of the threatened fiery 
destruction had been for many years considered 
<pb n="125"/>  
an inadmissible 
idea.  But wonders and wild fancies had been, of late days, 
strangely rife among mankind; and although it was only with a few 
of the ignorant that actual apprehension prevailed, upon the 
announcement by astronomers of a <hi rend="italic">new</hi> comet, yet this 
announcement was generally received with I know not what of 
agitation and mistrust. 
</p><p>The elements of the strange orb were immediately calculated, 
and it was at once conceded by all observers, that its path, at 
perihelion, would bring it into very close proximity with the 
earth.  There were two or three astronomers, of secondary note, 
who resolutely maintained that a contact was inevitable.  I 
cannot very well express to you the effect of this intelligence 
upon the people.  For a few short days they would not believe an 
assertion which their intellect, so long employed among worldly 
considerations, could not in any manner grasp.  But the truth of 
a vitally important fact soon makes its way into the 
understanding of even the most stolid.  Finally, all men saw that 
astronomical knowledge lied not, and they awaited the comet.  Its 
approach was not, at first, seemingly rapid; nor was its 
appearance of very unusual character.  It was of a dull red, 
and had little perceptible train.  For seven or eight days we saw no 
material increase in its apparent diameter, and but a partial 
alteration in its colour.  Meanwhile the ordinary affairs of men 
were discarded, and all interests absorbed in a growing 
discussion, instituted by the philosophic, in respect to the 
cometary nature.  Even the grossly ignorant aroused their 
sluggish capacities to such considerations.  The learned <hi rend="italic">now</hi> 
gave their intellect &mdash; their soul &mdash; to such points as the allaying 
of fear, or to the sustenance of loved theory.  They sought &mdash; they 
panted for right views.  They groaned for perfected knowledge. 
<hi rend="italic">Truth</hi> arose in the purity of her strength and exceeding 
majesty, and the wise bowed down and adored. 
</p><p>That material injury to our globe or to its inhabitants 
would result from the apprehended contact, was an opinion which 
hourly lost ground among the wise; and the wise were now freely 
permitted to rule the reason and the fancy of the crowd.  It was 
demonstrated, that the density of the comet's <hi rend="italic">nucleus</hi> was far 
less than that of our rarest gas; and the harmless passage of a 
similar visitor among the satellites of Jupiter was a point 
strongly insisted upon, and which served greatly to allay terror. 
Theologists, with an earnestness fear-enkindled, dwelt upon the 
biblical prophecies, and expounded them to the people with a 
directness and simplicity of which no previous 
<pb n="126"/>  
instance had been 
known.  That the final destruction of the earth must be brought 
about by the agency of fire, was urged with a spirit that 
enforced everywhere conviction; and that the comets were of no 
fiery nature (as all men now knew) was a truth which relieved 
all, in a great measure, from the apprehension of the great 
calamity foretold.  It is noticeable that the popular prejudices 
and vulgar errors in regard to pestilences and wars &mdash; 
errors which were wont to prevail upon every appearance of a comet &mdash; were now 
altogether unknown.  As if by some sudden convulsive exertion, 
reason had at once hurled superstition from her throne.  The 
feeblest intellect had derived vigour from excessive interest. 
</p><p>What minor evils might arise from the contact were points of 
elaborate question.  The learned spoke of slight geological 
disturbances, of probable alterations in climate, and 
consequently in vegetation; of possible magnetic and electric 
influences.  Many held that no visible or perceptible effect 
would in any manner be produced.  While such discussions were 
going on, their subject gradually approached, growing larger in 
apparent diameter, and of a more brilliant lustre.  Mankind grew 
paler as it came.  All human operations were suspended. 
</p><p>There was an epoch in the course of the general sentiment 
when the comet had attained, at length, a size surpassing that of 
any previously recorded visitation.  The people now, dismissing 
any lingering hope that the astronomers were wrong, experienced 
all the certainty of evil.  The chimerical aspect of their terror 
was gone.  The hearts of the stoutest of our race beat violently 
within their bosoms.  A very few days sufficed, however, to merge 
even such feelings in sentiments more unendurable.  We could no 
longer apply to the strange orb any <hi rend="italic">accustomed</hi> thoughts.  Its 
<hi rend="italic">historical</hi> attributes had disappeared.  It oppressed us with 
a hideous <hi rend="italic">novelty</hi> of emotion.  We saw it not as an 
astronomical phenomenon in the heavens, but as an incubus upon 
our hearts, and a shadow upon our brains.  It had taken, with 
inconceivable rapidity, the character of a gigantic mantle of 
rare flame, extending from horizon to horizon. 
</p><p>Yet a day, and men breathed with greater freedom.  It 
was clear that we were already within the influence of the comet; yet 
we lived.  We even felt an unusual elasticity of frame and 
vivacity of mind.  The exceeding tenuity of the object of our 
dread was apparent; for all heavenly objects were plainly visible 
through it.  Meantime, our vegetation had perceptibly altered; 
and we gained faith, from this predicted circumstance, 
<pb n="127"/>  
in the 
foresight of the wise.  A wild luxuriance of foliage, utterly 
unknown before, burst out upon every vegetable thing. 
</p><p>Yet another day &mdash; and the evil was not altogether upon us. 
It was now evident that its nucleus would first reach us.  A wild 
change had come over all men; and the first sense of <hi rend="italic">pain</hi> was 
the wild signal for general lamentation and horror.  This first 
sense of pain lay in a rigorous constriction of the breast and 
lungs, and an insufferable dryness of the skin.  It could not be 
denied that our atmosphere was radically affected; the 
conformation of this atmosphere and the possible modifications to 
which it might be subjected, were now the topics of discussion. 
The result of investigation sent an electric thrill of the 
intensest horror through the universal heart of man. 
</p><p>It had been long known that the air which encircled us was a 
compound of oxygen and nitrogen gases, in the proportion of 
twenty-one measures of oxygen, and seventy-nine of nitrogen, in 
every one hundred of the atmosphere.  Oxygen, which was the 
principle of combustion, and the vehicle of heat, was absolutely 
necessary to the support of animal life, and was the most 
powerful and energetic agent in nature.  Nitrogen, on the 
contrary, was incapable of supporting either animal life or 
flame.  An unnatural excess of oxygen would result, it had been 
ascertained, in just such an elevation of the animal spirits as 
we had latterly experienced.  It was the pursuit, the extension 
of the idea, which had engendered awe.  What would be the result 
of a <hi rend="italic">total extraction of the nitrogen</hi>?  A combustion 
irresistible, all-devouring, omni-prevalent, immediate; &mdash; the 
entire fulfilment, in all their minute and terrible details, of 
the fiery and horror-inspiring denunciations of the prophecies of 
the Holy Book. 
</p><p>Why need I paint, Charmion, the now disenchained frenzy of 
mankind?  That tenuity in the comet which had previously inspired 
us with hope, was now the source of the bitterness of despair. 
In its impalpable gaseous character we clearly perceived the 
consummation of Fate.  Meantime a day again passed, bearing away 
with it the last shadow of Hope.  We gasped in the rapid 
modification of the air.  The red blood bounded tumultuously 
through its strict channels.  A furious delirium possessed all 
men; and, with arms rigidly outstretched towards the threatening 
heavens, they trembled and shrieked aloud.  But the nucleus of 
the destroyer was now upon us: even here in Aidenn, I shudder 
while I speak.  Let me be brief &mdash; brief as the ruin that 
overwhelmed.  For a moment there was a wild lurid light alone, 
visiting and penetrating all things.  Then &mdash; let us 
<pb n="128"/>  
bow down, 
Charmion, before the excessive majesty of the great God! &mdash; then, 
there came a shouting and pervading sound, as if from the mouth 
itself of HIM; while the whole incumbent mass of ether in which 
we existed, burst at once into a species of intense flame, for 
whose surpassing brilliancy and all-fervid heat even the angels 
in the high Heaven of pure knowledge have no name.  Thus ended 
all.
