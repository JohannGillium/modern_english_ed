THE MEN IN THE STORM. <lb/>
BY STEPHEN CRANE.
</head>

<p>AT about three o'clock of the February afternoon, the blizzard
began to swirl great clouds of snow along the streets, sweeping it
down from the roofs and up from the pavements until the faces of
pedestrians tingled and burned as from a thousand needle-prickings.
Those on the walks huddled their necks closely in the collars of
their coats and went along stooping like a race of aged people.
The drivers of vehicles hurried their horses furiously on their
way.  They were made more cruel by the exposure of their positions,
aloft on high seats.  The street cars, bound up-town, went slowly,
the horses slipping and straining in the spongy brown mass that lay
between the rails.  The drivers, muffled to the eyes, stood erect
and facing the wind, models of grim philosophy.  Overhead the
trains rumbled and roared, and the dark structure of the elevated
railroad, stretching over the avenue, dripped little streams and
drops of water upon the mud and snow beneath it.
</p><p> All the clatter of the street was softened by the masses that
lay upon the cobbles until, even to one who looked from a window,
it became important music, a melody of life made necessary to the
ear by the dreariness of the pitiless beat and sweep of the storm.
Occasionally one could see black figures of men busily shovelling
the white drifts from the walks.  The sounds from their labor
created new recollections of rural experiences which every man
manages to have in a measure.  Later, the immense windows of the
shops became aglow with light, throwing great beams of orange and
yellow upon the pavement.  They were infinitely cheerful, yet in a
way they accented the force and discomfort of the storm, and gave
a meaning to the pace of the people and the vehicles, scores of
pedestrians and drivers, wretched with cold faces, necks and feet,
speeding for scores of unknown doors and entrances, scattering to
an infinite variety of shelters, to places which the imagination
made warm with the familiar colors of home.
</p><p> There was an absolute expression of hot dinners in the pace of
the people.  If one dared to speculate upon the destination of
those who came trooping, he lost himself in a maze of social
calculations; he might fling a handful of sand and attempt to
follow
<pb n="663"/>  the flight of each particular grain.  But as to the
suggestion of hot dinners, he was in firm lines of thought, for it
was upon every hurrying face.  It is a matter of tradition; it is
from the tales of childhood.  It comes forth with every storm.
</p><p> However, in a certain part of a dark West-side street, there
was a collection of men to whom these things were as if they were
not.  In this street was located a charitable house where for five
cents the homeless of the city could get a bed at night and, in the
morning, coffee and bread.
</p><p> During the afternoon of the storm, the whirling snows acted as
drivers, as men with whips, and at half-past three, the walk before
the closed doors of the house was covered with wanderers of the
street, waiting.  For some distance on either side of the place
they could be seen lurking in doorways and behind projecting parts
of buildings, gathering in close bunches in an effort to get warm.
A covered wagon drawn up near the curb sheltered a dozen of them.
Under the stairs that led to the elevated railway station, there
were six or eight, their hands stuffed deep in their pockets, their
shoulders stooped, jiggling their feet.  Others always could be
seen coming, a strange procession, some slouching along with the
characteristic hopeless gait of professional strays, some coming
with hesitating steps wearing the air of men to whom this sort of
thing was new.
</p><p> It was an afternoon of incredible length.  The snow, blowing
in twisting clouds, sought out the men in their meagre hiding-places and skilfully beat in among them, drenching their persons
with showers of fine, stinging flakes.  They crowded together,
muttering, and fumbling in their pockets to get their red, inflamed
wrists covered by the cloth.
</p><p> Newcomers usually halted at one of the groups and addressed a
question, perhaps much as a matter of form, "Is it open yet?"
</p><p> Those who had been waiting inclined to take the questioner
seriously and become contemptuous.  "No; do yeh think we'd be
standin' here?"
</p><p> The gathering swelled in numbers steadily and persistently.
One could always see them coming, trudging slowly through the
storm.
</p><p> Finally, the little snow plains in the street began to assume
a leaden hue from the shadows of evening.  The buildings upreared
gloomily save where various windows became brilliant figures of
light that made shimmers and splashes of yellow on the snow.  A
street lamp on the curb struggled to illuminate, but it was reduced
to impotent blindness by the swift gusts of sleet crusting its
panes.
</p><p> In this half-darkness, the men began to come from their
shelter places and mass in front of the doors of charity.  They
were of <pb n="664"/>  all types, but the nationalities were mostly
American, German and Irish.  Many were strong, healthy, clear-skinned fellows with that stamp of countenance which is not
frequently seen upon seekers after charity.  There were men of
undoubted patience, industry and temperance, who in time of ill-fortune, do not habitually turn to rail at the state of society,
snarling at the arrogance of the rich and bemoaning the cowardice
of the poor, but who at these times are apt to wear a sudden and
singular meekness, as if they saw the world's progress marching
from them and were trying to perceive where they had failed, what
they had lacked, to be thus vanquished in the race.  Then there
were others of the shifting, Bowery lodging-house element who were
used to paying ten cents for a place to sleep, but who now came
here because it was cheaper.
</p><p> But they were all mixed in one mass so thoroughly that one
could not have discerned the different elements but for the fact
that the laboring men, for the most part, remained silent and
impassive in the blizzard, their eyes fixed on the windows of the
house, statues of patience.
</p><p> The sidewalk soon became completely blocked by the bodies of
the men.  They pressed close to one another like sheep in a
winter's gale, keeping one another warm by the heat of their
bodies.  The snow came down upon this compressed group of men
until, directly from above, it might have appeared like a heap of
snow-covered merchandise, if it were not for the fact that the
crowd swayed gently with a unanimous, rhythmical motion.  It was
wonderful to see how the snow lay upon the heads and shoulders of
these men, in little ridges an inch thick perhaps in places, the
flakes steadily adding drop and drop, precisely as they fall upon
the unresisting grass of the fields.  The feet of the men were all
wet and cold and the wish to warm them accounted for the slow,
gentle, rhythmical motion.  Occasionally some man whose ears or
nose tingled acutely from the cold winds would wriggle down until
his head was protected by the shoulders of his companions.
</p><p> There was a continuous murmuring discussion as to the
probability of the doors being speedily opened.  They persistently
lifted their eyes toward the windows.  One could hear little
combats of opinion.
</p><p> "There's a light in th' winder!"
</p><p> "Naw; it's a reflection f'm across th' way."
</p><p> "Well, didn't I see 'em lite it?"
</p><p> "You did?"
</p><p> "I did!"
</p><p> "Well, then, that settles it!" <pb n="665"/>
</p><p> As the time approached when they expected to be allowed to
enter, the men crowded to the doors in an unspeakable crush,
jamming and wedging in a way that it seemed would crack bones.
They surged heavily against the building in a powerful wave of
pushing shoulders.  Once a rumor flitted among all the tossing
heads.
</p><p> "They can't open th' doors!  Th' fellers er smack up ag'in
'em."
</p><p> Then a dull roar of rage came from the men on the outskirts;
but all the time they strained and pushed until it appeared to be
impossible for those that they cried out against to do anything but
be crushed to pulp.
</p><p> "Ah, git away f'm th' door!"
</p><p> "Git outa that!"
</p><p> "Throw 'em out!"
</p><p> "Kill 'em!"
</p><p> "Say, fellers, now, what th' 'ell?  Give 'em a chanct t' open
th' door!"
</p><p> "Yeh damned pigs, give 'em a chanct t' open th' door!"
</p><p> Men in the outskirts of the crowd occasionally yelled when a
boot-heel of one of frantic trampling feet crushed on their
freezing extremities.
</p><p> "Git off me feet, yeh clumsy tarrier!"
</p><p> "Say, don't stand on me feet!  Walk on th' ground!"
</p><p> A man near the doors suddenly shouted: "O-o-oh!  Le' me out&mdash;
le' me out!"  And another, a man of infinite valor, once twisted
his head so as to half face those who were pushing behind him.
"Quit yer shovin', yeh"&mdash;and he delivered a volley of the most
powerful and singular invective straight into the faces of the men
behind him.  It was as if he was hammering the noses of them with
curses of triple brass.  His face, red with rage, could be seen;
upon it, an expression of sublime disregard of consequences.  But
nobody cared to reply to his imprecations; it was too cold.  Many
of them snickered and all continued to push.
</p><p> In occasional pauses of the crowd's movement the men had
opportunity to make jokes; usually grim things, and no doubt very
uncouth.  Nevertheless, they are notable&mdash;one does not expect to
find the quality of humor in a heap of old clothes under a
snowdrift.
</p><p> The winds seemed to grow fiercer as time wore on.  Some of the
gusts of snow that came down on the close collection of heads cut
like knives and needles, and the men huddled, and swore, not like
dark assassins, but in a sort of an American fashion, grimly and
desperately, it is true, but yet with a wondrous under-effect,
indefinable and mystic, as if there was some kind of humor in this
catastrophe, in this situation in a night of snow-laden winds.
<pb n="666"/>
</p><p> Once, the window of the huge dry-goods shop across the street
furnished material for a few moments of forgetfulness.  In the
brilliantly-lighted space appeared the figure of a man.  He was
rather stout and very well clothed.  His whiskers were fashioned
charmingly after those of the Prince of Wales.  He stood in an
attitude of magnificent reflection.  He slowly stroked his
moustache with a certain grandeur of manner, and looked down at the
snow-encrusted mob.  From below, there was denoted a supreme
complacence in him.  It seemed that the sight operated inversely,
and enabled him to more clearly regard his own environment,
delightful relatively.
</p><p> One of the mob chanced to turn his head and perceive the
figure in the window.  "Hello, lookit 'is whiskers," he said
genially.
</p><p> Many of the men turned then, and a shout went up.  They called
to him in all strange keys.  They addressed him in every manner,
from familiar and cordial greetings to carefully-worded advice
concerning changes in his personal appearance.  The man presently
fled, and the mob chuckled ferociously like ogres who had just
devoured something.
</p><p> They turned then to serious business.  Often they addressed
the stolid front of the house.
</p><p> "Oh, let us in fer Gawd's sake!"
</p><p> "Let us in or we'll all drop dead!"
</p><p> "Say, what's th' use o' keepin' all us poor Indians out in th'
cold?"
</p><p> And always some one was saying, "Keep off me feet."
</p><p> The crushing of the crowd grew terrific toward the last.  The
men, in keen pain from the blasts, began almost to fight.  With the
pitiless whirl of snow upon them, the battle for shelter was going
to the strong.  It became known that the basement door at the foot
of a little steep flight of stairs was the one to be opened, and
they jostled and heaved in this direction like laboring fiends.
One could hear them panting and groaning in their fierce exertion.
</p><p> Usually some one in the front ranks was protesting to those in
the rear: "O&mdash;o&mdash;ow!  Oh, say, now, fellers, let up, will yeh?  Do
yeh wanta kill somebody?"
</p><p> A policeman arrived and went into the midst of them, scolding
and berating, occasionally threatening, but using no force but that
of his hands and shoulders against these men who were only
struggling to get in out of the storm.  His decisive tones rang out
sharply: "Stop that pushin' back there!  Come, boys, don't push!
Stop that!  Here, you, quit yer shovin'!  Cheese that!"
</p><p> When the door below was opened, a thick stream of men forced
a way down the stairs, which were of an extraordinary <pb n="667"/>
narrowness and seemed only wide enough for one at a time.  Yet they
somehow went down almost three abreast.  It was a difficult and
painful operation.  The crowd was like a turbulent water forcing
itself through one tiny outlet.  The men in the rear, excited by
the success of the others, made frantic exertions, for it seemed
that this large band would more than fill the quarters and that
many would be left upon the pavements.  It would be disastrous to
be of the last, and accordingly men with the snow biting their
faces, writhed and twisted with their might.  One expected that
from the tremendous pressure, the narrow passage to the basement
door would be so choked and clogged with human limbs and bodies
that movement would be impossible.  Once indeed the crowd was
forced to stop, and a cry went along that a man had been injured at
the foot of the stairs.  But presently the slow movement began
again, and the policeman fought at the top of the flight to ease
the pressure on those who were going down.
</p><p> A reddish light from a window fell upon the faces of the men
when they, in turn, arrived at the last three steps and were about
to enter.  One could then note a change of expression that had come
over their features.  As they thus stood upon the threshold of
their hopes, they looked suddenly content and complacent.  The fire
had passed from their eyes and the snarl had vanished from their
lips.  The very force of the crowd in the rear, which had
previously vexed them, was regarded from another point of view, for
it now made it inevitable that they should go through the little
doors into the place that was cheery and warm with light.
</p><p> The tossing crowd on the sidewalk grew smaller and smaller.
The snow beat with merciless persistence upon the bowed heads of
those who waited.  The wind drove it up from the pavements in
frantic forms of winding white, and it seethed in circles about the
huddled forms, passing in, one by one, three by three, out of the
storm.
