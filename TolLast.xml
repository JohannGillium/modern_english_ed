<head>My Last Visit to My Mother</head> 
<byline>By <docAuthor>COUNT ILYA TOLSTOY</docAuthor></byline> 
 
 
<p>WITH all the other appalling news from Russia comes word of the 
devastation of the home of Leo Tolstoy and the burning of his 
manuscripts.  This news is so horrible that I cannot believe it is true. 
I cannot believe the people can be so blinded as to attack a helpless 
old woman, the widow of the greatest man of Russia, and destroy the 
precious relics that have no other value except that of preserving the 
memory of this man. 
    
</p><p>Yasnaya Polyana is the Mecca and Medina of the Russian people. 
Here lived the greatest soul of Russia, the "Conscience of the World," 
as many called him during his lifetime.  At times a man refuses to 
listen to the voice of this conscience.  Its admonitions torment him. 
He tries to flee from it.  But these efforts are vain.  The more he 
endeavors to free himself, the greater is the torture. 
    
</p><p>Poor Russian people, you are so blinded and intoxicated by the 
light of liberty, which came to you so suddenly, that after centuries of 
slavery you do not see this light and you do not understand. 
    
</p><p>Before leaving Russia to sail for America a few weeks ago, I 
desired to see my mother at Yasnaya Polyana.  I left Moscow on a night 
train, and at eight o'clock I was at the small station of Zasieka, next 
the town of Tula.  I had no carriage, and as the distance is only two 
miles, I made the trip on foot.  It was in the beginning of October. 
The untraveled road, bordered on both sides by woods, was miry and 
muddy.  The yellow leaves, already falling, formed a soft carpet on 
which I trod.  I was alone, and my mind was full of thoughts and 
reminiscences. 
    
</p><p>I recalled how seven years ago I had walked over this same road, 
together with a crowd of thousands of people, a procession following the 
coffin in which my father lay.  That was also in the autumn, in the gray 
fog of the morning.  It reminded me of those significant days when my 
father, burning with a desire for a complete change in his way of 
living, left forever the roof of his ancestors; when, morally 
invincible, he of his own free will went forth to meet death. 
 
<pb n="776"/> 
    
</p><p>Since that time many changes have come to Yasnaya Polyana.  The 
house where my father dwelt is no longer the place to which the 
intellect of the world looks for the solution of moral doubts and the 
answer to spiritual questioning, the refuge of conscience.  How many 
interesting people used to visit my father!  Here one could see 
representatives of all classes and of all nations.  Beggars came for the 
usual ten copecks that my father was accustomed to give them.  These 
people used to gather under a large tree in front of the house, and my 
father would speak with each one of them about his life.  He never left 
them without giving them words of consolation. 
    
</p><p>Visitors from Europe and America were always received with a warm 
hospitality.  Almost all of the prominent persons of Russia and many 
celebrities from all parts of the world were guests at my father's home, 
writers, scientists, musicians, painters, sculptors, and even 
politicians.  All were welcome there.  He had the rare capacity to give 
to each one with whom he talked something of special interest and also 
to draw from every one something that was interesting to himself. 
    
</p><p>Now the home of my father is silent.  The inhabitants of the 
house are widows, my mother, my mother's sister, and my own sister, 
together with her daughter, a charming little girl of about eight years. 
Everything is quiet in the house.  My father's rooms are closed, and are 
kept by my mother exactly as they were when he left them.  His bed is 
made as it was during his life.  Over the head of the bed hangs the 
picture of my eldest sister.  On a little table beside his bed are his 
watch and medicine-bottles.  In another room are his writing-table, 
book-cases, and bookshelves.  Some of the books he was reading before 
his departure lie opened just as he left them.  Over the walls one sees 
pictures of his father, his brother, and of other members of his family. 
Here are also pictures of Dickens, Schopenhauer, and a large portrait of 
Henry George which was brought to him by Mr. George's son. 
    
</p><p>When you enter these rooms it seems as though my father were 
still living there, as though he had left it only a few moments ago, and 
might return at any minute.  The large dining-room, which also was the 
reception-room of the house, is open.  On the walls of this room are 
pictures of my father's ancestors.  They are faded and blurred by the 
lapse of centuries.  Here you see my great-grandfather, Count Ilya 
Tolstoy, for whom I am named, a kind-looking old gentleman who 
squandered an enormous fortune on festivals and various caprices and 
gaieties.  He liked French wines best, and he used to send messengers to 
France by post to procure them.  He could not tolerate linen laundered 
in Russia, so he had it sent by post to Holland.  All this was one 
hundred and twenty years ago, before even the idea of railroads had 
entered the mind of man. 
    
</p><p>Here is another picture of another ancestor of mine, Prince 
Volkinsky, a proud old nobleman of the end of the eighteenth century, 
the former owner of the property of Yasnaya Polyana and the builder of 
the estate. 
    
</p><p>Again you see the picture of Prince Gorchakoff, father-in-law of 
Count Ilya Tolstoy, a handsome old gentleman with a periwig of the times 
of Catharine the Great; also the picture of the mother of Prince 
Gorchakoff, born Princess Mordkin, with a rosary around her neck.  On 
the other side of the wall you see the pictures of my father, my two 
sisters, my mother, and some busts.  These portraits were made by the 
best Russian artists, Repin, Gai, Kramskoi, Seroff, and Prince 
Troubetskoy.  I love this room.  It makes me think of the life of many 
past generations.  My own brightest reminiscences are also associated 
with it.  Here I spent my childhood, my youth, and many of the best 
hours of my life. 
    
</p><p>That morning, a few weeks ago, when I entered the house I was 
welcomed by the old servant who has been with us for more than 
twenty-five years, Ilya Vasilievitch. 
    
</p><p>"The countess has risen.  Will you please go up-stairs?" he said. 
 
<pb n="777"/> 
    
</p><p>My mother was waiting for me at the top of the stairway. 
Although seventyfour years old, still she is in good health, active, 
erect, with hair not entirely gray. 
    
</p><p>"I knew that you would come, and I was expecting you," she said 
in greeting me.  "Do you wish a cup of tea?" 
    
</p><p>"Yes," I answered. 
    
</p><p>The same large samovar that I remember for forty years was 
boiling on the table.  Nothing had been changed.  I felt that everything 
has remained as it had been for forty years.  The only difference was 
that the door leading to my father's rooms was closed, and I felt that 
it would never open, that I would never again see in its frame the form 
of an old man dressed in a long, gray blouse, with large, gray eyes 
looking from under thick and drooping eyebrows.  His eyes were so 
penetrating, that it was impossible to stand his gaze for any length of 
time.  I always felt that he could see the depths of my soul.  I could 
see his eyes looking at me now from Repin's portrait of him.  Still, 
they are not quite his.  No brush in the world could paint the living 
power of those eyes. 
    
</p><p>The life in Russia at the present time is very difficult for 
every one, including my mother.  Even in Yasnaya Polyana, where 
everything speaks of my father's thought for the common people, where 
three generations of peasants were educated under his immediate 
influence, where he himself taught the peasants' children not only fifty 
years ago, but also in recent years, and where almost all the property 
that belonged to my father was distributed free among the people&mdash;even 
here the Revolution has brought deprivations.  Not more than two weeks 
before my visit a mob of peasants&mdash;women, girls, and children from three 
surrounding villages&mdash;broke into our orchard and for three consecutive 
days stripped the trees of apples.  The very day of my arrival the 
gardener came to my mother and told her that her cabbages had been 
stolen from the garden.  Such lawlessness oppressed my mother.  She did 
not wish to violate the principles which my father had held and 
preached; therefore she was unwilling to summon the police, the only aid 
to which she could resort.  All this troubled her greatly. 
    
</p><p>The material side of life has other difficulties for her also. 
She had enough wheat to last only a few weeks.  She is not able to buy 
it in other places, because of a new law in Russia that does not allow 
transportation of wheat from one place to another.  Although her 
household is not large, still she feels obliged to maintain some of her 
old servants, who have been in the house for more than thirty years. 
She cannot dismiss them, because they are bound to our family by mutual 
love and attachment. 
    
</p><p>It is true that she could leave her home and live in the city, 
but she fears to do so.  She fears to leave this house, where everything 
is full of the memory of her great husband.  So she remains there as a 
faithful guard over his rooms, his library, and his relics.  All that is 
precious not only to her and to our family, but also to every Russian. 
    
</p><p>While I was speaking with my mother, my sister and aunt entered 
the room.  The conversation then became general.  When I told them I was 
on my way to America, they all envied me.  They asked me many questions 
about my last visit to America.  In Russia, where now there is such a 
chaos of ideas, of political parties, and such a constantly changing 
current of thought, the organized and orderly life of America seems to 
be unattainable and unbelievable. 
    
</p><p>As everywhere now in Russia, the conversation turned to politics 
and the Revolution.  We recalled the ideas of my father on this subject; 
recalled how strongly he used to deplore every form of violence and all 
excesses of revolutions.  He used to say that the distance between the 
revolutionists, using violence, and true Christians was the greatest 
distance that can exist between two divisions of people.  He used to 
illustrate the idea as follows: 
    
</p><p>"Imagine a broken ring.  On the one side of the opening are the 
Christians, on 
 
<pb n="778"/> 
 
the other side the violent revolutionists. 
Although these opposing forces seem to be 
very close, they are separated by the entire distance in this broken ring." 
    
</p><p>He used to say that he could not see any difference between the 
despotism of the czar and the despotism of any other ruler, and that a 
revolution could not contribute to the happiness of the common people. 
As every government exploits the people, he could see no difference 
between exploitation by one man and exploitation by another.  After the 
Russian Revolution of 1905, he wrote in his diary: 
    
</p><p>"It is a very strange idea that one government must be replaced 
by another.  Our duty is to explain that this is a false idea, and we 
must struggle against it.  The best means of correcting this false idea 
is not to participate in what is wrong, but to explain the principles 
that will make evil impossible to justify.  Every change in the form of 
government produced by violence would inevitably lead to another change 
that would have to be brought about also by violence.  And all these 
changes are wrong, because every revolution lowers the morale of the 
country. . . . 
    
</p><p>"I was thinking to-day about the state of mind of the people who 
are taking active part in the Revolution.  The principles that guide 
these people are envy, greed, and malice.  These people have only to 
complain, and immediately there are at hand promoters of evil sentiments 
to encourage them in their discontent.  Therefore the sin rests not upon 
the people, but upon the leaders. . . .  The active forces of the 
Revolution are the press and agitators.  These are moved by ambition, 
selfishness, and vanity, and also by envy and hatred.  We must have 
compassion upon these miserable people, who are infected by this poison. 
We must exercise every power not only to free ourselves from it, but 
also to free others." 
    
</p><p>Recalling these words and applying them to the present events, we 
are forced to see that he was certainly right. 
    
</p><p>But, unfortunately, no one in Russia listens to his voice at the 
present time.  People who share his ideas are forced to remain silent. 
The propaganda of the Bolsheviki has nothing in common with my father's 
ideas.  Their policy is based upon violence.  All the moral teachings of 
my father are based upon love and the entire repudiation of every kind 
of violence. 
    
</p><p>The seeds planted by him are still living.  During the last year 
the interest in his philosophical ideas has increased visibly.  For 
example, the number of visitors at the Tolstoy Museum in Moscow and in 
Petrograd last year was three times as great as in any previous year. 
    
</p><p>The educated class of Russia, the class whose moral and 
scientific enlightenment is greater than is found in any other place in 
the world, is still living in Russia.  Certainly the time will come when 
these people will be able to make themselves heard.  I see the coming of 
this day.  It is not far distant. 
    
</p><p>In the evening of my visit home the peasants of the village of 
Yasnaya Polyana showed themselves to be in sympathy with us.  They held 
a meeting and denounced the attack made upon my mother's home. 
Remembering the many favors my father had done for them, they promised 
to protect all her property, and even expressed regret that her orchards 
and gardens had been looted by members of their families. 
    
</p><p>How typical is this little episode!  How well it illustrates the 
state of mind of the whole Russian nation at the present time!  Is not 
all Russia abusing the great idea of liberty?  But I already hear the 
words of penitence that are coming.  I hear these words in the mouths of 
millions of people. 
    
</p><p>That is what I thought on my way back to the station.  The night 
was dark, and the ruts in the road were full of mud.  In the midst of 
this darkness the stars shone brightly, inspiring hope and 
confidence.</p>
