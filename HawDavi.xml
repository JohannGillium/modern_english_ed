<head>DAVID SWAN<lb/>
A FANTASY</head>

<p>WE can be but partially acquainted even with the events which
actually
influence our course through life, and our final destiny. There are
innumerable other events&mdash;if such they may be called&mdash;which come
close
upon us, yet pass away without actual results, or even betraying
their
near approach, by the reflection of any light or shadow across our
minds.
Could we know all the vicissitudes of our fortunes, life would be
too full
of hope and fear, exultation or disappointment, to afford us a
single hour
of true serenity. This idea may be illustrated by a page from the
secret
history of David Swan.
</p><p>We have nothing to do with David until we find him, at the
age of
twenty, on the high road from his native place to the city of
Boston, where
his uncle, a small dealer in the grocery line, was to take him
behind the
counter. Be it enough to say that he was a native of New Hampshire,
born
of respectable parents, and had received an ordinary school
education,
with a classic finish by a year at Gilmanton Academy. After
journeying
on foot from sunrise till nearly noon of a summer's day, his
weariness and
the increasing heat determined him to sit down in the first
convenient
shade, and await the coming up of the stage-coach. As if planted on
purpose for him, there soon appeared a little tuft of maples, with
a
delightful
recess in the midst, and such a fresh bubbling spring that it
seemed never
to have sparkled for any wayfarer but David Swan. Virgin or not, he
kissed it with his thirsty lips, and then flung himself along the
brink, pillowing his head upon some shirts and a pair of
pantaloons, tied up
in a
striped cotton handkerchief. The sunbeams could not reach him; the
dust
did not yet rise from the road after the heavy rain of yesterday;
and his
grassy lair suited the young man better than a bed of down. The
spring
   <pb n="938"/>
murmured drowsily beside him; the branches waved dreamily across
the
blue sky overhead; and a deep sleep, perchance hiding dreams within
its
depths, fell upon David Swan. But we are to relate events which he
did
not dream of.
</p><p>While he lay sound asleep in the shade, other people were
wide awake,
and passed to and fro, afoot, on horseback, and in all sorts of
vehicles,
along the sunny road by his bedchamber. Some looked neither to the
right
hand nor the left, and knew not that he was there; some merely
glanced
that way, without admitting the slumberer among their busy
thoughts;
some laughed to see how soundly he slept; and several, whose hearts
were
brimming full of scorn, ejected their venomous superfluity on David
Swan. A middle-aged widow, when nobody else was near, thrust her
head
a little way into the recess, and vowed that the young fellow
looked
charming in his sleep. A temperance lecturer saw him, and wrought
poor
David into the texture of his evening's discourse, as an awful
instance of
dead drunkenness by the roadside. But censure, praise, merriment,
scorn,
and indifference were all one, or rather all nothing, to David
Swan.
</p><p>He had slept only a few moments when a brown carriage, drawn
by a
handsome pair of horses, bowled easily along, and was brought to a
standstill nearly in front of David's resting-place. A linchpin had
fallen out,
and permitted one of the wheels to slide off. The damage was
slight, and
occasioned merely a momentary alarm to an elderly merchant and his
wife, who were returning to Boston in the carriage. While the
coachman
and a servant were replacing the wheel, the lady and gentleman
sheltered
themselves beneath the maple-trees, and there espied the bubbling
fountain, and David Swan asleep beside it. Impressed with the awe
which
the
humblest sleeped usually sheds around him, the merchant trod as
lightly
as the gout would allow; and his spouse took good heed not to
rustle her
silk gown, lest David should start up all of a sudden.
</p><p>``How soundly he sleeps!'' whispered the old gentleman.
``From what a
depth he draws that easy breath! Such sleep as that, brought on
without
an opiate, would be worth more to me than half my income; for it
would
suppose health and an untroubled mind.''
</p><p>``And youth, besides,'' said the lady. ``Healthy and quiet
age does not
sleep thus. Our slumber is no more like his than our wakefulness.''
</p><p>The longer they looked the more did this elderly couple feel
interested
in the unknown youth, to whom the wayside and the maple shade were
as
a secret chamber, with the rich gloom of damask curtains brooding
over
him. Perceiving that a stray sunbeam glimmered down upon his face,
the
lady contrived to twist a branch aside, so as to intercept it. And
having
done this little act of kindness, she began to feel like a mother
to him.
</p><p>``Providence seems to have laid him here,'' whispered she to
her husband, ``and to have brought us hither to find him, after our
disappointment in our cousin's son. Methinks I can see a likeness
to our
departed
Henry. Shall we waken him?''
</p><p>``To what purpose?'' said the merchant, hesitating. ``We
know nothing
of the youth's character.''
   <pb n="939"/>
</p><p>``That open countenance!'' replied his wife, in the same
hushed voice,
yet earnestly. ``This innocent sleep!''
</p><p>While these whispers were passing, the sleeper's heart did
not throb,
nor his breath become agitated, nor his features betray the least
token of
interest. Yet Fortune was bending over him, just ready to let fall
a burden of gold. The old merchant had lost his only son, and had
no
heir to his
wealth except a distant relative, with whose conduct he was
dissatisfied.
In such cases, people sometimes do stranger things than to act the
magician, and awaken a young man to splendor who fell asleep in
poverty.
</p><p>``Shall we not waken him?'' repeated the lady persuasively.
</p><p>``The coach is ready, sir,'' said the servant, behind.
</p><p>The old couple started, reddened, and hurried away, mutually
wondering that they should ever have dreamed of doing anything so
very
ridiculous. The merchant threw himself back in the carriage, and
occupied
his
mind with the plan of a magnificent asylum for unfortunate men of
business. Meanwhile, David Swan enjoyed his nap.
</p><p>The carriage could not have gone above a mile or two, when
a pretty
young girl came along, with a tripping pace, which showed precisely
how
her little heart was dancing in her bosom. Perhaps it was this
merry kind
of motion that caused&mdash;is there any harm in saying it?&mdash;her garter
to slip
its knot. Conscious that the silken girth&mdash;if silk it were&mdash;was
relaxing its
hold, she turned aside into the shelter of the maple-trees, and
there found
a young man asleep by the spring! Blushing as red as any rose that
she
should have intruded into a gentleman's bedchamber, and for such a
purpose, too, she was about to make her escape on tiptoe. But there
was peril
near the sleeper. A monster of a bee had been wandering
overhead&mdash;buzz,
buzz, buzz&mdash;now among the leaves, now flashing through the strips
of
sunshine, and now lost in the dark shade, till finally he appeared
to be
settling on the eyelid of David Swan. The sting of a bee is
sometimes
deadly. As free hearted as she was innocent, the girl attacked the
intruder
with her handkerchief, brushed him soundly, and drove him from
beneath
the mapleshade. How sweet a picture! This good deed accomplished,
with
quickened breath, and a deeper blush, she stole a glance at the
youthful
stranger for whom she had been battling with a dragon in the air.
</p><p>``He is handsome!'' thought she, and blushed redder yet.
</p><p>How could it be that no dream of bliss grew so strong within
him, that,
shattered by its very strength, it should part asunder, and allow
him to
perceive the girl among its phantoms? Why, at least, did no smile
of welcome brighten upon his face? She was come, the maid whose
soul,
according to the old and beautiful idea, had been severed from his
own,
and
whom, in all his vague but passionate desires, he yearned to meet.
Her,
only, could he love with a perfect love; him, only, could she
receive into
the depths of her heart; and now her image was faintly blushing in
the
fountain, by his side; should it pass away, its happy lustre would
never
gleam upon his life again.
</p><p>``How sound he sleeps!'' murmured the girl.
   <pb n="940"/>
</p><p>She departed, but did not trip along the road so lightly as
when she
came.
</p><p>Now, this girl's father was a thriving country merchant in
the neighborhood, and happened, at that identical time, to be
looking out for
just such
a young man as David Swan. Had David formed a wayside acquaintance
with the daughter, he would have become the father's clerk, and all
else in
natural succession. So here, again, had good fortune&mdash;the best of
fortunes
&mdash;stolen so near that her garments brushed against him; and he knew
nothing of the matter.
</p><p>The girl was hardly out of sight when two men turned aside
beneath the
maple shade. Both had dark faces, set off by cloth caps, which were
drawn
down aslant over their brows. Their dresses were shabby, yet had a
certain smartness. These were a couple of rascals who got their
living
by
whatever the devil sent them, and now, in the interim of other
business,
had staked the joint profits of their next piece of villany on a
game of
cards, which was to have been decided here under the trees. But,
finding
David asleep by the spring, one of the rogues whispered to his
fellow,&mdash;
</p><p>``Hist!&mdash;Do you see that bundle under his head?''
</p><p>The other villain nodded, winked, and leered.
</p><p>``I'll bet you a horn of brandy,'' said the first, ``that
the chap has either
a pocket-book, or a snug little hoard of small change, stowed away
amongst his shirts. And if not there, we shall find it in his
pantaloons
pocket.''
</p><p>``But how if he wakes?'' said the other.
</p><p>His companion thrust aside his waistcoat, pointed to the
handle of a
dirk, and nodded.
</p><p>``So be it!'' muttered the second villain.
</p><p>They approached the unconscious David, and, while one
pointed the
dagger towards his heart, the other began to search the bundle
beneath
his head. Their two faces, grim, wrinkled, and ghastly with guilt
and fear,
bent over their victim, looking horrible enough to be mistaken for
fiends,
should he suddenly awake. Nay, had the villains glanced aside into
the
spring, even they would hardly have known themselves as reflected
there.
But David Swan had never worn a more tranquil aspect, even when
asleep
on his mother's breast.
</p><p>``I must take away the bundle,'' whispered one.
</p><p>``If he stirs, I'll strike,'' muttered the other.
</p><p>But, at this moment, a dog scenting along the ground, came
in beneath
the maple-trees, and gazed alternately at each of these wicked men,
and
then at the quiet sleeper. He then lapped out of the fountain.
</p><p>``Pshaw!'' said one villain. ``We can do nothing now. The
dog's master
must be close behind.''
</p><p>``Let's take a drink and be off,'' said the other
</p><p>The man with the dagger thrust back the weapon into his
bosom, and
drew forth a pocket pistol, but not of that kind which kills by a
single discharge. It was a flask of liquor, with a block-tin
tumbler screwed
upon
the mouth. Each drank a comfortable dram, and left the spot, with
so
   <pb n="941"/>
many jests, and such laughter at their unaccomplished wickedness,
that
they might be said to have gone on their way rejoicing. In a few
hours
they had forgotten the whole affair, nor once imagined that the
recording
angel had written down the crime of murder against their souls, in
letters
as durable as eternity. As for David Swan, he still slept quietly,
neither
conscious of the shadow of death when it hung over him, nor of the
glow
of renewed life when that shadow was withdrawn.
</p><p>He slept, but no longer so quietly as at first. An hour's
repose had
snatched, from his elastic frame, the weariness with which many
hours of
toil had burdened it. Now he stirred&mdash;now, moved his lips, without
a
sound&mdash;now, talked, in an inward tone, to the noonday spectres of
his
dream. But a noise of wheels came rattling louder and louder along
the
road, until it dashed through the dispersing mist of David's
slumber&mdash;and there was the stage-coach. He started up with all his
ideas
about him.
</p><p>``Halloo, driver!&mdash;Take a passenger?'' shouted he.
</p><p>``Room on top!'' answered the driver.
</p><p>Up mounted David, and bowled away merrily towards Boston,
without so much as a parting glance at that fountain of dreamlike
vicissitude.
He knew not that a phantom of Wealth had thrown a golden hue upon
its
waters&mdash;nor that one of Love had sighed softly to their murmur&mdash;nor
that one of Death had threatened to crimson them with his
blood&mdash;all, in
the brief hour since he lay down to sleep. Sleeping or waking, we
hear not
the airy footsteps of the strange things that almost happen. Does
it not
argue a superintending Providence that, while viewless and
unexpected
events thrust themselves continually athwart our path, there should
still be regularity enough in mortal life to render foresight even
partially
available?</p>
