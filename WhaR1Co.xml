<p>  Three husbands seem to be the customary allowance granted by 
novelists to the pushing, climbing, heartless type of American 
woman, who will sacrifice everything to her social ambitions and 
insatiable love of pleasure.  Three husbands, it will be 
remembered, were given by Robert Grant to Selma White, the heroine 
of <hi rend="italic">Unleavened Bread;</hi> three also by Winston Churchill to the 
heroine

<pb n="417" id="WhaR1Co417"/>
of <hi rend="italic">A Modern Chronicle;</hi> and similarly, Mrs. 
Wharton is equally generous to Undine Spragg, the central figure of 
her latest volume, <hi rend="italic">The Custom of the Country</hi>.  It is a 
brilliantly cynical picture of feminine ruthlessness, and a 
fundamental inability to conceive of father, mother, friends and 
husbands having been created for any other purpose than to gratify 
every passing whim of this one beautiful and utterly spoiled young 
woman.  Mrs. Wharton has painted Undine Spragg with an unsparing 
mercilessness that almost makes the reader wince.  It is a splendid 
and memorable piece of work, a portrait to form a worthy contrast 
to the equally unforgettable one of Lily Bart.  But there is little 
object in analysing in detail the separate episodes which make Miss 
Spragg successively Mrs. Ralph Marvell, the Marquise de Chelles, 
and Mrs. Elmer Moffatt.  They are of a nature that cannot be 
adequately conveyed at second hand; it is not what happens that 
matters, it is the play of human motives and human limitations 
behind the happenings that makes this volume one of Mrs. Wharton's 
finest achievements.  And the final touch of the closing paragraph 
is a perfect climax, a crowning touch of comprehension of 
monumental and perennial dissatisfaction: 
</p> 
<p>Under all the dazzle a tiny black cloud remained.  She had 
learned there was something she could never get, something that 
neither beauty nor influence nor millions could ever buy for her.  
She could never be an ambassador's wife; and as she advanced to 
receive her first guests, she said to herself that it was the one 
part she was really made for.</p>
