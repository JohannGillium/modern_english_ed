</p><p><stage>Enter GLOUCESTER, solus</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Now is the winter of our discontent<lb/>
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;<lb/>
And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house<lb/>
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.<lb/>
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;<lb/>
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;<lb/>
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,<lb/>
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.<lb/>
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;<lb/>
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds<lb/>
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,<lb/>
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber<lb/>
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.<lb/>
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,<lb/>
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;<lb/>
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty<lb/>
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;<lb/>
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,<lb/>
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,<lb/>
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time<lb/>
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,<lb/>
And that so lamely and unfashionable<lb/>
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;<lb/>
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,<lb/>
Have no delight to pass away the time,<lb/>
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun<lb/>
And descant on mine own deformity:<lb/>
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,<lb/>
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,<lb/>
I am determined to prove a villain<lb/>
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.<lb/>
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,<lb/>
By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,<lb/>
To set my brother Clarence and the king<lb/>
In deadly hate the one against the other:<lb/>
And if King Edward be as true and just<lb/>
As I am subtle, false and treacherous,<lb/>
This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,<lb/>
About a prophecy, which says that 'G'<lb/>
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.<lb/>
Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here<lb/>
Clarence comes.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY</stage></p>


<p>
Brother, good day; what means this armed guard<lb/>
That waits upon your grace?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>His majesty<lb/>
Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed<lb/>
This conduct to convey me to the Tower.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Upon what cause?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>Because my name is George.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;<lb/>
He should, for that, commit your godfathers:<lb/>
O, belike his majesty hath some intent<lb/>
That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.<lb/>
But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest<lb/>
As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,<lb/>
He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;<lb/>
And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.<lb/>
And says a wizard told him that by G<lb/>
His issue disinherited should be;<lb/>
And, for my name of George begins with G,<lb/>
It follows in his thought that I am he.<lb/>
These, as I learn, and such like toys as these<lb/>
Have moved his highness to commit me now.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:<lb/>
'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:<lb/>
My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she<lb/>
That tempers him to this extremity.<lb/>
Was it not she and that good man of worship,<lb/>
Anthony Woodville, her brother there,<lb/>
That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,<lb/>
From whence this present day he is deliver'd?<lb/>
We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>By heaven, I think there's no man is secure<lb/>
But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds<lb/>
That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.<lb/>
Heard ye not what an humble suppliant<lb/>
Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Humbly complaining to her deity<lb/>
Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.<lb/>
I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,<lb/>
If we will keep in favour with the king,<lb/>
To be her men and wear her livery:<lb/>
The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,<lb/>
Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.<lb/>
Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRAKENBURY</speaker>
<p>I beseech your graces both to pardon me;<lb/>
His majesty hath straitly given in charge<lb/>
That no man shall have private conference,<lb/>
Of what degree soever, with his brother.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,<lb/>
You may partake of any thing we say:<lb/>
We speak no treason, man: we say the king<lb/>
Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen<lb/>
Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;<lb/>
We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,<lb/>
A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;<lb/>
And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:<lb/>
How say you sir? Can you deny all this?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRAKENBURY</speaker>
<p>With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,<lb/>
He that doth naught with her, excepting one,<lb/>
Were best he do it secretly, alone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRAKENBURY</speaker>
<p>What one, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRAKENBURY</speaker>
<p>I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal<lb/>
Forbear your conference with the noble duke.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.<lb/>
Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;<lb/>
And whatsoever you will employ me in,<lb/>
Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,<lb/>
I will perform it to enfranchise you.<lb/>
Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood<lb/>
Touches me deeper than you can imagine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>I know it pleaseth neither of us well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;<lb/>
Meantime, have patience.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>I must perforce. Farewell.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and Guard</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.<lb/>
Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,<lb/>
That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,<lb/>
If heaven will take the present at our hands.<lb/>
But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter HASTINGS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>Good time of day unto my gracious lord!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>As much unto my good lord chamberlain!<lb/>
Well are you welcome to the open air.<lb/>
How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:<lb/>
But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks<lb/>
That were the cause of my imprisonment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;<lb/>
For they that were your enemies are his,<lb/>
And have prevail'd as much on him as you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,<lb/>
While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>What news abroad?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>No news so bad abroad as this at home;<lb/>
The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,<lb/>
And his physicians fear him mightily.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.<lb/>
O, he hath kept an evil diet long,<lb/>
And overmuch consumed his royal person:<lb/>
'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.<lb/>
What, is he in his bed?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>He is.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Go you before, and I will follow you.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit HASTINGS</stage></p>


<p>
He cannot live, I hope; and must not die<lb/>
Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.<lb/>
I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,<lb/>
With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;<lb/>
And, if I fall not in my deep intent,<lb/>
Clarence hath not another day to live:<lb/>
Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,<lb/>
And leave the world for me to bustle in!<lb/>
For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.<lb/>
What though I kill'd her husband and her father?<lb/>
The readiest way to make the wench amends<lb/>
Is to become her husband and her father:<lb/>
The which will I; not all so much for love<lb/>
As for another secret close intent,<lb/>
By marrying her which I must reach unto.<lb/>
But yet I run before my horse to market:<lb/>
Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:<lb/>
When they are gone, then must I count my gains.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exit</stage>

<p><stage>The same. Another street.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter the corpse of KING HENRY the Sixth, Gentlemen	with halberds to guard it; LADY ANNE being the mourner</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Set down, set down your honourable load,<lb/>
If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,<lb/>
Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament<lb/>
The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.<lb/>
Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!<lb/>
Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!<lb/>
Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!<lb/>
Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,<lb/>
To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,<lb/>
Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,<lb/>
Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!<lb/>
Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,<lb/>
I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.<lb/>
Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!<lb/>
Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!<lb/>
Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!<lb/>
More direful hap betide that hated wretch,<lb/>
That makes us wretched by the death of thee,<lb/>
Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,<lb/>
Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!<lb/>
If ever he have child, abortive be it,<lb/>
Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,<lb/>
Whose ugly and unnatural aspect<lb/>
May fright the hopeful mother at the view;<lb/>
And that be heir to his unhappiness!<lb/>
If ever he have wife, let her he made<lb/>
A miserable by the death of him<lb/>
As I am made by my poor lord and thee!<lb/>
Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,<lb/>
Taken from Paul's to be interred there;<lb/>
And still, as you are weary of the weight,<lb/>
Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter GLOUCESTER</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>What black magician conjures up this fiend,<lb/>
To stop devoted charitable deeds?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,<lb/>
I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gentleman</speaker>
<p>My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:<lb/>
Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,<lb/>
Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,<lb/>
And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?<lb/>
Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,<lb/>
And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.<lb/>
Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!<lb/>
Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,<lb/>
His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;<lb/>
For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,<lb/>
Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.<lb/>
If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,<lb/>
Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.<lb/>
O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds<lb/>
Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!<lb/>
Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;<lb/>
For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood<lb/>
From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;<lb/>
Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,<lb/>
Provokes this deluge most unnatural.<lb/>
O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!<lb/>
O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!<lb/>
Either heaven with lightning strike the<lb/>
murderer dead,<lb/>
Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,<lb/>
As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood<lb/>
Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Lady, you know no rules of charity,<lb/>
Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:<lb/>
No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>But I know none, and therefore am no beast.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>More wonderful, when angels are so angry.<lb/>
Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,<lb/>
Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,<lb/>
By circumstance, but to acquit myself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,<lb/>
For these known evils, but to give me leave,<lb/>
By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have<lb/>
Some patient leisure to excuse myself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make<lb/>
No excuse current, but to hang thyself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>By such despair, I should accuse myself.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;<lb/>
For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,<lb/>
Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Say that I slew them not?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Why, then they are not dead:<lb/>
But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>I did not kill your husband.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Why, then he is alive.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw<lb/>
Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;<lb/>
The which thou once didst bend against her breast,<lb/>
But that thy brothers beat aside the point.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,<lb/>
which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.<lb/>
Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:<lb/>
Didst thou not kill this king?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>I grant ye.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too<lb/>
Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!<lb/>
O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;<lb/>
For he was fitter for that place than earth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>And thou unfit for any place but hell.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Some dungeon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Your bed-chamber.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>So will it, madam till I lie with you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>I hope so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,<lb/>
To leave this keen encounter of our wits,<lb/>
And fall somewhat into a slower method,<lb/>
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths<lb/>
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,<lb/>
As blameful as the executioner?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Your beauty was the cause of that effect;<lb/>
Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep<lb/>
To undertake the death of all the world,<lb/>
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,<lb/>
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;<lb/>
You should not blemish it, if I stood by:<lb/>
As all the world is cheered by the sun,<lb/>
So I by that; it is my day, my life.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>I would I were, to be revenged on thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>It is a quarrel most unnatural,<lb/>
To be revenged on him that loveth you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>It is a quarrel just and reasonable,<lb/>
To be revenged on him that slew my husband.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,<lb/>
Did it to help thee to a better husband.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>His better doth not breathe upon the earth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>He lives that loves thee better than he could.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Name him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Plantagenet.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Why, that was he.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>The selfsame name, but one of better nature.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Where is he?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Here.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>She spitteth at him</stage></p>


<p>
Why dost thou spit at me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Never came poison from so sweet a place.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Never hung poison on a fouler toad.<lb/>
Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>I would they were, that I might die at once;<lb/>
For now they kill me with a living death.<lb/>
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,<lb/>
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:<lb/>
These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,<lb/>
No, when my father York and Edward wept,<lb/>
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made<lb/>
When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;<lb/>
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,<lb/>
Told the sad story of my father's death,<lb/>
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,<lb/>
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks<lb/>
Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time<lb/>
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;<lb/>
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,<lb/>
Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.<lb/>
I never sued to friend nor enemy;<lb/>
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;<lb/>
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,<lb/>
My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>She looks scornfully at him</stage></p>


<p>
Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made<lb/>
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.<lb/>
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,<lb/>
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;<lb/>
Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.<lb/>
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,<lb/>
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,<lb/>
And humbly beg the death upon my knee.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword</stage></p>


<p>
Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,<lb/>
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.<lb/>
Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,<lb/>
But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Here she lets fall the sword</stage></p>


<p>
Take up the sword again, or take up me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,<lb/>
I will not be the executioner.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>I have already.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Tush, that was in thy rage:<lb/>
Speak it again, and, even with the word,<lb/>
That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,<lb/>
Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;<lb/>
To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>I would I knew thy heart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>'Tis figured in my tongue.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>I fear me both are false.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Then never man was true.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Well, well, put up your sword.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Say, then, my peace is made.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>That shall you know hereafter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>But shall I live in hope?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>All men, I hope, live so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Vouchsafe to wear this ring.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>To take is not to give.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.<lb/>
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;<lb/>
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.<lb/>
And if thy poor devoted suppliant may<lb/>
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,<lb/>
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>What is it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>That it would please thee leave these sad designs<lb/>
To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,<lb/>
And presently repair to Crosby Place;<lb/>
Where, after I have solemnly interr'd<lb/>
At Chertsey monastery this noble king,<lb/>
And wet his grave with my repentant tears,<lb/>
I will with all expedient duty see you:<lb/>
For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,<lb/>
Grant me this boon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>With all my heart; and much it joys me too,<lb/>
To see you are become so penitent.<lb/>
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Bid me farewell.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>'Tis more than you deserve;<lb/>
But since you teach me how to flatter you,<lb/>
Imagine I have said farewell already.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt LADY ANNE, TRESSEL, and BERKELEY</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Sirs, take up the corse.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GENTLEMEN</speaker>
<p>Towards Chertsey, noble lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER</stage></p>


<p>
Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?<lb/>
Was ever woman in this humour won?<lb/>
I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.<lb/>
What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,<lb/>
To take her in her heart's extremest hate,<lb/>
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,<lb/>
The bleeding witness of her hatred by;<lb/>
Having God, her conscience, and these bars<lb/>
against me,<lb/>
And I nothing to back my suit at all,<lb/>
But the plain devil and dissembling looks,<lb/>
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!<lb/>
Ha!<lb/>
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,<lb/>
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,<lb/>
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?<lb/>
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,<lb/>
Framed in the prodigality of nature,<lb/>
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,<lb/>
The spacious world cannot again afford<lb/>
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,<lb/>
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,<lb/>
And made her widow to a woful bed?<lb/>
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?<lb/>
On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?<lb/>
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,<lb/>
I do mistake my person all this while:<lb/>
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,<lb/>
Myself to be a marvellous proper man.<lb/>
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,<lb/>
And entertain some score or two of tailors,<lb/>
To study fashions to adorn my body:<lb/>
Since I am crept in favour with myself,<lb/>
Will maintain it with some little cost.<lb/>
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;<lb/>
And then return lamenting to my love.<lb/>
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,<lb/>
That I may see my shadow as I pass.<lb/>

<head>Scene 3</head>

<p><stage>The palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, RIVERS, and GREY</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>RIVERS</speaker>
<p>Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty<lb/>
Will soon recover his accustom'd health.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREY</speaker>
<p>In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:<lb/>
Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,<lb/>
And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>If he were dead, what would betide of me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RIVERS</speaker>
<p>No other harm but loss of such a lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>The loss of such a lord includes all harm.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREY</speaker>
<p>The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,<lb/>
To be your comforter when he is gone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Oh, he is young and his minority<lb/>
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,<lb/>
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RIVERS</speaker>
<p>Is it concluded that he shall be protector?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>It is determined, not concluded yet:<lb/>
But so it must be, if the king miscarry.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GREY</speaker>
<p>Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Good time of day unto your royal grace!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DERBY</speaker>
<p>God make your majesty joyful as you have been!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.<lb/>
To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.<lb/>
Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,<lb/>
And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured<lb/>
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DERBY</speaker>
<p>I do beseech you, either not believe<lb/>
The envious slanders of her false accusers;<lb/>
Or, if she be accused in true report,<lb/>
Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds<lb/>
From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RIVERS</speaker>
<p>Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DERBY</speaker>
<p>But now the Duke of Buckingham and I<lb/>
Are come from visiting his majesty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>What likelihood of his amendment, lords?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>God grant him health! Did you confer with him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement<lb/>
Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,<lb/>
And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;<lb/>
And sent to warn them to his royal presence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Would all were well! but that will never be<lb/>
I fear our happiness is at the highest.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:<lb/>
Who are they that complain unto the king,<lb/>
That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?<lb/>
By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly<lb/>
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.<lb/>
Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,<lb/>
Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,<lb/>
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,<lb/>
I must be held a rancorous enemy.<lb/>
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,<lb/>
But thus his simple truth must be abused<lb/>
By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RIVERS</speaker>
<p>To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.<lb/>
When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?<lb/>
Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?<lb/>
A plague upon you all! His royal person,&mdash;<lb/>
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!&mdash;<lb/>
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,<lb/>
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.<lb/>
The king, of his own royal disposition,<lb/>
And not provoked by any suitor else;<lb/>
Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,<lb/>
Which in your outward actions shows itself<lb/>
Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,<lb/>
Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather<lb/>
The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,<lb/>
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:<lb/>
Since every Jack became a gentleman<lb/>
There's many a gentle person made a Jack.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Come, come, we know your meaning, brother<lb/>
Gloucester;<lb/>
You envy my advancement and my friends':<lb/>
God grant we never may have need of you!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:<lb/>
Your brother is imprison'd by your means,<lb/>
Myself disgraced, and the nobility<lb/>
Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions<lb/>
Are daily given to ennoble those<lb/>
That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>By Him that raised me to this careful height<lb/>
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,<lb/>
I never did incense his majesty<lb/>
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been<lb/>
An earnest advocate to plead for him.<lb/>
My lord, you do me shameful injury,<lb/>
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>You may deny that you were not the cause<lb/>
Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RIVERS</speaker>
<p>She may, my lord, for&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?<lb/>
She may do more, sir, than denying that:<lb/>
She may help you to many fair preferments,<lb/>
And then deny her aiding hand therein,<lb/>
And lay those honours on your high deserts.<lb/>
What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RIVERS</speaker>
<p>What, marry, may she?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>What, marry, may she! marry with a king,<lb/>
A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:<lb/>
I wis your grandam had a worser match.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne<lb/>
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:<lb/>
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty<lb/>
With those gross taunts I often have endured.<lb/>
I had rather be a country servant-maid<lb/>
Than a great queen, with this condition,<lb/>
To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter QUEEN MARGARET, behind</stage></p>


<p>
Small joy have I in being England's queen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!<lb/>
Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>What! threat you me with telling of the king?<lb/>
Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said<lb/>
I will avouch in presence of the king:<lb/>
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.<lb/>
'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Out, devil! I remember them too well:<lb/>
Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,<lb/>
And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,<lb/>
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;<lb/>
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,<lb/>
A liberal rewarder of his friends:<lb/>
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>In all which time you and your husband Grey<lb/>
Were factious for the house of Lancaster;<lb/>
And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband<lb/>
In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?<lb/>
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,<lb/>
What you have been ere now, and what you are;<lb/>
Withal, what I have been, and what I am.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>A murderous villain, and so still thou art.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;<lb/>
Yea, and forswore himself,&mdash;which Jesu pardon!&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Which God revenge!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>To fight on Edward's party for the crown;<lb/>
And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.<lb/>
I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;<lb/>
Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine<lb/>
I am too childish-foolish for this world.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,<lb/>
Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RIVERS</speaker>
<p>My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days<lb/>
Which here you urge to prove us enemies,<lb/>
We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:<lb/>
So should we you, if you should be our king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:<lb/>
Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>As little joy, my lord, as you suppose<lb/>
You should enjoy, were you this country's king,<lb/>
As little joy may you suppose in me.<lb/>
That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;<lb/>
For I am she, and altogether joyless.<lb/>
I can no longer hold me patient.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Advancing</stage></p>


<p>
Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out<lb/>
In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!<lb/>
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?<lb/>
If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,<lb/>
Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?<lb/>
O gentle villain, do not turn away!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;<lb/>
That will I make before I let thee go.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Wert thou not banished on pain of death?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>I was; but I do find more pain in banishment<lb/>
Than death can yield me here by my abode.<lb/>
A husband and a son thou owest to me;<lb/>
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:<lb/>
The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,<lb/>
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>The curse my noble father laid on thee,<lb/>
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper<lb/>
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,<lb/>
And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout<lb/>
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland&mdash;<lb/>
His curses, then from bitterness of soul<lb/>
Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;<lb/>
And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>So just is God, to right the innocent.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,<lb/>
And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RIVERS</speaker>
<p>Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DORSET</speaker>
<p>No man but prophesied revenge for it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>What were you snarling all before I came,<lb/>
Ready to catch each other by the throat,<lb/>
And turn you all your hatred now on me?<lb/>
Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?<lb/>
That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,<lb/>
Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,<lb/>
Could all but answer for that peevish brat?<lb/>
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?<lb/>
Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!<lb/>
If not by war, by surfeit die your king,<lb/>
As ours by murder, to make him a king!<lb/>
Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,<lb/>
For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,<lb/>
Die in his youth by like untimely violence!<lb/>
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,<lb/>
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!<lb/>
Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;<lb/>
And see another, as I see thee now,<lb/>
Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!<lb/>
Long die thy happy days before thy death;<lb/>
And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,<lb/>
Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!<lb/>
Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,<lb/>
And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son<lb/>
Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,<lb/>
That none of you may live your natural age,<lb/>
But by some unlook'd accident cut off!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.<lb/>
If heaven have any grievous plague in store<lb/>
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,<lb/>
O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,<lb/>
And then hurl down their indignation<lb/>
On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!<lb/>
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!<lb/>
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,<lb/>
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!<lb/>
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,<lb/>
Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream<lb/>
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!<lb/>
Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!<lb/>
Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity<lb/>
The slave of nature and the son of hell!<lb/>
Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!<lb/>
Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!<lb/>
Thou rag of honour! thou detested&mdash;<lb/>

<p>I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought<lb/>
That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.<lb/>
O, let me make the period to my curse!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!<lb/>
Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,<lb/>
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?<lb/>
Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.<lb/>
The time will come when thou shalt wish for me<lb/>
To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,<lb/>
Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RIVERS</speaker>
<p>Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>To serve me well, you all should do me duty,<lb/>
Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:<lb/>
O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DORSET</speaker>
<p>Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:<lb/>
Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.<lb/>
O, that your young nobility could judge<lb/>
What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!<lb/>
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;<lb/>
And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DORSET</speaker>
<p>It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,<lb/>
Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,<lb/>
And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!<lb/>
Witness my son, now in the shade of death;<lb/>
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath<lb/>
Hath in eternal darkness folded up.<lb/>
Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.<lb/>
O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!<lb/>
As it was won with blood, lost be it so!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Have done! for shame, if not for charity.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Urge neither charity nor shame to me:<lb/>
Uncharitably with me have you dealt,<lb/>
And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.<lb/>
My charity is outrage, life my shame<lb/>
And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Have done, have done.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,<lb/>
In sign of league and amity with thee:<lb/>
Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!<lb/>
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,<lb/>
Nor thou within the compass of my curse.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Nor no one here; for curses never pass<lb/>
The lips of those that breathe them in the air.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,<lb/>
And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.<lb/>
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!<lb/>
Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,<lb/>
His venom tooth will rankle to the death:<lb/>
Have not to do with him, beware of him;<lb/>
Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,<lb/>
And all their ministers attend on him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?<lb/>
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?<lb/>
O, but remember this another day,<lb/>
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,<lb/>
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!<lb/>
Live each of you the subjects to his hate,<lb/>
And he to yours, and all of you to God's!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RIVERS</speaker>
<p>And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,<lb/>
She hath had too much wrong; and I repent<lb/>
My part thereof that I have done to her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>I never did her any, to my knowledge.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>But you have all the vantage of her wrong.<lb/>
I was too hot to do somebody good,<lb/>
That is too cold in thinking of it now.<lb/>
Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,<lb/>
He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains<lb/>
God pardon them that are the cause of it!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RIVERS</speaker>
<p>A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,<lb/>
To pray for them that have done scathe to us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>So do I ever:<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
being well-advised.<lb/>
For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CATESBY</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CATESBY</speaker>
<p>Madam, his majesty doth call for you,<lb/>
And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RIVERS</speaker>
<p>Madam, we will attend your grace.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.<lb/>
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach<lb/>
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.<lb/>
Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,<lb/>
I do beweep to many simple gulls<lb/>
Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;<lb/>
And say it is the queen and her allies<lb/>
That stir the king against the duke my brother.<lb/>
Now, they believe it; and withal whet me<lb/>
To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:<lb/>
But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,<lb/>
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:<lb/>
And thus I clothe my naked villany<lb/>
With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;<lb/>
And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter two Murderers</stage></p>


<p>
But, soft! here come my executioners.<lb/>
How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!<lb/>
Are you now going to dispatch this deed?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant<lb/>
That we may be admitted where he is.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Well thought upon; I have it here about me.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Gives the warrant</stage></p>


<p>
When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.<lb/>
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,<lb/>
Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;<lb/>
For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps<lb/>
May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Tush!<lb/>
Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;<lb/>
Talkers are no good doers: be assured<lb/>
We come to use our hands and not our tongues.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:<lb/>
I like you, lads; about your business straight;<lb/>
Go, go, dispatch.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>We will, my noble lord.<lb/>

<head>Scene 4</head>

<p><stage>London. The Tower.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>BRAKENBURY</speaker>
<p>Why looks your grace so heavily today?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>O, I have pass'd a miserable night,<lb/>
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,<lb/>
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,<lb/>
I would not spend another such a night,<lb/>
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,<lb/>
So full of dismal terror was the time!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRAKENBURY</speaker>
<p>What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,<lb/>
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;<lb/>
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;<lb/>
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk<lb/>
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,<lb/>
And cited up a thousand fearful times,<lb/>
During the wars of York and Lancaster<lb/>
That had befall'n us. As we paced along<lb/>
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,<lb/>
Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,<lb/>
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,<lb/>
Into the tumbling billows of the main.<lb/>
Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!<lb/>
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!<lb/>
What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!<lb/>
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;<lb/>
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;<lb/>
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,<lb/>
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,<lb/>
All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:<lb/>
Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes<lb/>
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,<lb/>
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,<lb/>
Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,<lb/>
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRAKENBURY</speaker>
<p>Had you such leisure in the time of death<lb/>
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>Methought I had; and often did I strive<lb/>
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood<lb/>
Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth<lb/>
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;<lb/>
But smother'd it within my panting bulk,<lb/>
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRAKENBURY</speaker>
<p>Awaked you not with this sore agony?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;<lb/>
O, then began the tempest to my soul,<lb/>
Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,<lb/>
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,<lb/>
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.<lb/>
The first that there did greet my stranger soul,<lb/>
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;<lb/>
Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury<lb/>
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'<lb/>
And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by<lb/>
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair<lb/>
Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,<lb/>
'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,<lb/>
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;<lb/>
Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'<lb/>
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends<lb/>
Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears<lb/>
Such hideous cries, that with the very noise<lb/>
I trembling waked, and for a season after<lb/>
Could not believe but that I was in hell,<lb/>
Such terrible impression made the dream.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRAKENBURY</speaker>
<p>No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;<lb/>
I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>O Brakenbury, I have done those things,<lb/>
Which now bear evidence against my soul,<lb/>
For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!<lb/>
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,<lb/>
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,<lb/>
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,<lb/>
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!<lb/>
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;<lb/>
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRAKENBURY</speaker>
<p>I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>CLARENCE sleeps</stage></p>


<p>
Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,<lb/>
Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.<lb/>
Princes have but their tides for their glories,<lb/>
An outward honour for an inward toil;<lb/>
And, for unfelt imagination,<lb/>
They often feel a world of restless cares:<lb/>
So that, betwixt their tides and low names,<lb/>
There's nothing differs but the outward fame.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter the two Murderers</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Ho! who's here?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRAKENBURY</speaker>
<p>In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRAKENBURY</speaker>
<p>Yea, are you so brief?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show<lb/>
him our commission; talk no more.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>BRAKENBURY reads it</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRAKENBURY</speaker>
<p>I am, in this, commanded to deliver<lb/>
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:<lb/>
I will not reason what is meant hereby,<lb/>
Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.<lb/>
Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:<lb/>
I'll to the king; and signify to him<lb/>
That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit BRAKENBURY</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till<lb/>
the judgment-day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind<lb/>
of remorse in me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>What, art thou afraid?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be<lb/>
damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>I thought thou hadst been resolute.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>So I am, to let him live.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour<lb/>
will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one<lb/>
would tell twenty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>How dost thou feel thyself now?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet<lb/>
within me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Remember our reward, when the deed is done.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Where is thy conscience now?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,<lb/>
thy conscience flies out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>How if it come to thee again?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it<lb/>
makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it<lb/>
accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;<lb/>
he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it<lb/>
detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that<lb/>
mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of<lb/>
obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold<lb/>
that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it<lb/>
is turned out of all towns and cities for a<lb/>
dangerous thing; and every man that means to live<lb/>
well endeavours to trust to himself and to live<lb/>
without it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me<lb/>
not to kill the duke.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he<lb/>
would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,<lb/>
I warrant thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his<lb/>
reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy<lb/>
sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt<lb/>
in the next room.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>O excellent devise! make a sop of him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>No, first let's reason with him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second murderer</speaker>
<p>You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>In God's name, what art thou?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>A man, as you are.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>But not, as I am, royal.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>Nor you, as we are, loyal.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!<lb/>
Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?<lb/>
Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Both</speaker>
<p>To, to, to&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>To murder me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Both</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,<lb/>
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.<lb/>
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Offended us you have not, but the king.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>I shall be reconciled to him again.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>Are you call'd forth from out a world of men<lb/>
To slay the innocent? What is my offence?<lb/>
Where are the evidence that do accuse me?<lb/>
What lawful quest have given their verdict up<lb/>
Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced<lb/>
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?<lb/>
Before I be convict by course of law,<lb/>
To threaten me with death is most unlawful.<lb/>
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption<lb/>
By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,<lb/>
That you depart and lay no hands on me<lb/>
The deed you undertake is damnable.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>What we will do, we do upon command.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>And he that hath commanded is the king.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings<lb/>
Hath in the tables of his law commanded<lb/>
That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,<lb/>
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?<lb/>
Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,<lb/>
To hurl upon their heads that break his law.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,<lb/>
For false forswearing and for murder too:<lb/>
Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,<lb/>
To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>And, like a traitor to the name of God,<lb/>
Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade<lb/>
Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,<lb/>
When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?<lb/>
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,<lb/>
He sends ye not to murder me for this<lb/>
For in this sin he is as deep as I.<lb/>
If God will be revenged for this deed.<lb/>
O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,<lb/>
Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;<lb/>
He needs no indirect nor lawless course<lb/>
To cut off those that have offended him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,<lb/>
When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,<lb/>
That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,<lb/>
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;<lb/>
I am his brother, and I love him well.<lb/>
If you be hired for meed, go back again,<lb/>
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,<lb/>
Who shall reward you better for my life<lb/>
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:<lb/>
Go you to him from me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Both</speaker>
<p>Ay, so we will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>Tell him, when that our princely father York<lb/>
Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,<lb/>
And charged us from his soul to love each other,<lb/>
He little thought of this divided friendship:<lb/>
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>O, do not slander him, for he is kind.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Right,<lb/>
As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:<lb/>
'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>It cannot be; for when I parted with him,<lb/>
He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,<lb/>
That he would labour my delivery.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee<lb/>
From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,<lb/>
To counsel me to make my peace with God,<lb/>
And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,<lb/>
That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?<lb/>
Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on<lb/>
To do this deed will hate you for the deed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>What shall we do?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>Relent, and save your souls.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLARENCE</speaker>
<p>Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.<lb/>
Which of you, if you were a prince's son,<lb/>
Being pent from liberty, as I am now,<lb/>
if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,<lb/>
Would not entreat for life?<lb/>
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:<lb/>
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,<lb/>
Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,<lb/>
As you would beg, were you in my distress<lb/>
A begging prince what beggar pities not?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>Look behind you, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Take that, and that: if all this will not do,<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Stabs him</stage></p>


<p>
I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit, with the body</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!<lb/>
How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands<lb/>
Of this most grievous guilty murder done!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter First Murderer</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?<lb/>
By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>I would he knew that I had saved his brother!<lb/>
Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;<lb/>
For I repent me that the duke is slain.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>So do not I: go, coward as thou art.<lb/>
Now must I hide his body in some hole,<lb/>
Until the duke take order for his burial:<lb/>
And when I have my meed, I must away;<lb/>
For this will out, and here I must not stay.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV sick, QUEEN	ELIZABETH, DORSET, RIVERS, HASTINGS, BUCKINGHAM,	GREY, and others</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
<p>Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:<lb/>
You peers, continue this united league:<lb/>
I every day expect an embassage<lb/>
From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;<lb/>
And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,<lb/>
Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.<lb/>
Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;<lb/>
Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RIVERS</speaker>
<p>By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:<lb/>
And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
<p>Take heed you dally not before your king;<lb/>
Lest he that is the supreme King of kings<lb/>
Confound your hidden falsehood, and award<lb/>
Either of you to be the other's end.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RIVERS</speaker>
<p>And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
<p>Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,<lb/>
Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;<lb/>
You have been factious one against the other,<lb/>
Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;<lb/>
And what you do, do it unfeignedly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Here, Hastings; I will never more remember<lb/>
Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
<p>Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DORSET</speaker>
<p>This interchange of love, I here protest,<lb/>
Upon my part shall be unviolable.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>And so swear I, my lord<lb/>

</p><p><stage>They embrace</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
<p>Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league<lb/>
With thy embracements to my wife's allies,<lb/>
And make me happy in your unity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate<lb/>
On you or yours,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To the Queen</stage></p>


<p>
but with all duteous love<lb/>
Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me<lb/>
With hate in those where I expect most love!<lb/>
When I have most need to employ a friend,<lb/>
And most assured that he is a friend<lb/>
Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,<lb/>
Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,<lb/>
When I am cold in zeal to yours.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
<p>A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,<lb/>
is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.<lb/>
There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,<lb/>
To make the perfect period of this peace.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter GLOUCESTER</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:<lb/>
And, princely peers, a happy time of day!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
<p>Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.<lb/>
Brother, we done deeds of charity;<lb/>
Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,<lb/>
Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:<lb/>
Amongst this princely heap, if any here,<lb/>
By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,<lb/>
Hold me a foe;<lb/>
If I unwittingly, or in my rage,<lb/>
Have aught committed that is hardly borne<lb/>
By any in this presence, I desire<lb/>
To reconcile me to his friendly peace:<lb/>
'Tis death to me to be at enmity;<lb/>
I hate it, and desire all good men's love.<lb/>
First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,<lb/>
Which I will purchase with my duteous service;<lb/>
Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,<lb/>
If ever any grudge were lodged between us;<lb/>
Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;<lb/>
That without desert have frown'd on me;<lb/>
Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.<lb/>
I do not know that Englishman alive<lb/>
With whom my soul is any jot at odds<lb/>
More than the infant that is born to-night<lb/>
I thank my God for my humility.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:<lb/>
I would to God all strifes were well compounded.<lb/>
My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty<lb/>
To take our brother Clarence to your grace.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this<lb/>
To be so bouted in this royal presence?<lb/>
Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>They all start</stage></p>


<p>
You do him injury to scorn his corse.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RIVERS</speaker>
<p>Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>All seeing heaven, what a world is this!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DORSET</speaker>
<p>Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence<lb/>
But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
<p>Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>But he, poor soul, by your first order died,<lb/>
And that a winged Mercury did bear:<lb/>
Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,<lb/>
That came too lag to see him buried.<lb/>
God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,<lb/>
Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,<lb/>
Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,<lb/>
And yet go current from suspicion!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter DERBY</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DORSET</speaker>
<p>A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
<p>I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DORSET</speaker>
<p>I will not rise, unless your highness grant.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
<p>Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DORSET</speaker>
<p>The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;<lb/>
Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman<lb/>
Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING EDWARD IV</speaker>
<p>Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,<lb/>
And shall the same give pardon to a slave?<lb/>
My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,<lb/>
And yet his punishment was cruel death.<lb/>
Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,<lb/>
Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised<lb/>
Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?<lb/>
Who told me how the poor soul did forsake<lb/>
The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?<lb/>
Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury<lb/>
When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,<lb/>
And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?<lb/>
Who told me, when we both lay in the field<lb/>
Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me<lb/>
Even in his own garments, and gave himself,<lb/>
All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?<lb/>
All this from my remembrance brutish wrath<lb/>
Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you<lb/>
Had so much grace to put it in my mind.<lb/>
But when your carters or your waiting-vassals<lb/>
Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced<lb/>
The precious image of our dear Redeemer,<lb/>
You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;<lb/>
And I unjustly too, must grant it you<lb/>
But for my brother not a man would speak,<lb/>
Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself<lb/>
For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all<lb/>
Have been beholding to him in his life;<lb/>
Yet none of you would once plead for his life.<lb/>
O God, I fear thy justice will take hold<lb/>
On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!<lb/>
Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.<lb/>
Oh, poor Clarence!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt some with KING EDWARD IV and QUEEN MARGARET</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not<lb/>
How that the guilty kindred of the queen<lb/>
Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?<lb/>
O, they did urge it still unto the king!<lb/>
God will revenge it. But come, let us in,<lb/>
To comfort Edward with our company.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>We wait upon your grace.<lb/>

<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>The palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter the DUCHESS OF YORK, with the two children of CLARENCE</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>Boy</speaker>
<p>Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>No, boy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boy</speaker>
<p>Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,<lb/>
And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Girl</speaker>
<p>Why do you look on us, and shake your head,<lb/>
And call us wretches, orphans, castaways<lb/>
If that our noble father be alive?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;<lb/>
I do lament the sickness of the king.<lb/>
As loath to lose him, not your father's death;<lb/>
It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boy</speaker>
<p>Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.<lb/>
The king my uncle is to blame for this:<lb/>
God will revenge it; whom I will importune<lb/>
With daily prayers all to that effect.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Girl</speaker>
<p>And so will I.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:<lb/>
Incapable and shallow innocents,<lb/>
You cannot guess who caused your father's death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boy</speaker>
<p>Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester<lb/>
Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,<lb/>
Devised impeachments to imprison him :<lb/>
And when my uncle told me so, he wept,<lb/>
And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;<lb/>
Bade me rely on him as on my father,<lb/>
And he would love me dearly as his child.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,<lb/>
And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!<lb/>
He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;<lb/>
Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boy</speaker>
<p>Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Ay, boy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boy</speaker>
<p>I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, with her hair about her	ears; RIVERS, and DORSET after her</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,<lb/>
To chide my fortune, and torment myself?<lb/>
I'll join with black despair against my soul,<lb/>
And to myself become an enemy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>What means this scene of rude impatience?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>To make an act of tragic violence:<lb/>
Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.<lb/>
Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?<lb/>
Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?<lb/>
If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,<lb/>
That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;<lb/>
Or, like obedient subjects, follow him<lb/>
To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow<lb/>
As I had title in thy noble husband!<lb/>
I have bewept a worthy husband's death,<lb/>
And lived by looking on his images:<lb/>
But now two mirrors of his princely semblance<lb/>
Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,<lb/>
And I for comfort have but one false glass,<lb/>
Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.<lb/>
Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,<lb/>
And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:<lb/>
But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,<lb/>
And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,<lb/>
Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,<lb/>
Thine being but a moiety of my grief,<lb/>
To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boy</speaker>
<p>Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;<lb/>
How can we aid you with our kindred tears?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Girl</speaker>
<p>Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;<lb/>
Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Give me no help in lamentation;<lb/>
I am not barren to bring forth complaints<lb/>
All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,<lb/>
That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,<lb/>
May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!<lb/>
Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Children</speaker>
<p>Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Children</speaker>
<p>What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>What stays had I but they? and they are gone.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Was never widow had so dear a loss!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Children</speaker>
<p>Were never orphans had so dear a loss!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Was never mother had so dear a loss!<lb/>
Alas, I am the mother of these moans!<lb/>
Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.<lb/>
She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;<lb/>
I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:<lb/>
These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;<lb/>
I for an Edward weep, so do not they:<lb/>
Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,<lb/>
Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,<lb/>
And I will pamper it with lamentations.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DORSET</speaker>
<p>Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased<lb/>
That you take with unthankfulness, his doing:<lb/>
In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,<lb/>
With dull unwilligness to repay a debt<lb/>
Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;<lb/>
Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,<lb/>
For it requires the royal debt it lent you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RIVERS</speaker>
<p>Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,<lb/>
Of the young prince your son: send straight for him<lb/>
Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:<lb/>
Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,<lb/>
And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, and RATCLIFF</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause<lb/>
To wail the dimming of our shining star;<lb/>
But none can cure their harms by wailing them.<lb/>
Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;<lb/>
I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee<lb/>
I crave your blessing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,<lb/>
Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Amen; and make me die a good old man!<lb/>
That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing:<lb/>
I marvel why her grace did leave it out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,<lb/>
That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,<lb/>
Now cheer each other in each other's love<lb/>
Though we have spent our harvest of this king,<lb/>
We are to reap the harvest of his son.<lb/>
The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,<lb/>
But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,<lb/>
Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:<lb/>
Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,<lb/>
Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd<lb/>
Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RIVERS</speaker>
<p>Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,<lb/>
The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,<lb/>
Which would be so much the more dangerous<lb/>
By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:<lb/>
Where every horse bears his commanding rein,<lb/>
And may direct his course as please himself,<lb/>
As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,<lb/>
In my opinion, ought to be prevented.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>I hope the king made peace with all of us<lb/>
And the compact is firm and true in me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RIVERS</speaker>
<p>And so in me; and so, I think, in all:<lb/>
Yet, since it is but green, it should be put<lb/>
To no apparent likelihood of breach,<lb/>
Which haply by much company might be urged:<lb/>
Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,<lb/>
That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>And so say I.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Then be it so; and go we to determine<lb/>
Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.<lb/>
Madam, and you, my mother, will you go<lb/>
To give your censures in this weighty business?<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH, DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>With all our harts.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOUCESTER</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,<lb/>
For God's sake, let not us two be behind;<lb/>
For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,<lb/>
As index to the story we late talk'd of,<lb/>
To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>My other self, my counsel's consistory,<lb/>
My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,<lb/>
I, like a child, will go by thy direction.<lb/>
Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
<p>I promise you, I scarcely know myself:<lb/>
Hear you the news abroad?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>Ay, that the king is dead.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
<p>Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:<lb/>
I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter another Citizen</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Citizen</speaker>
<p>Neighbours, God speed!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>Give you good morrow, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Citizen</speaker>
<p>Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
<p>Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Citizen</speaker>
<p>Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Citizen</speaker>
<p>Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
<p>In him there is a hope of government,<lb/>
That in his nonage council under him,<lb/>
And in his full and ripen'd years himself,<lb/>
No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>So stood the state when Henry the Sixth<lb/>
Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Citizen</speaker>
<p>Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;<lb/>
For then this land was famously enrich'd<lb/>
With politic grave counsel; then the king<lb/>
Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Citizen</speaker>
<p>Better it were they all came by the father,<lb/>
Or by the father there were none at all;<lb/>
For emulation now, who shall be nearest,<lb/>
Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.<lb/>
O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!<lb/>
And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:<lb/>
And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,<lb/>
This sickly land might solace as before.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Citizen</speaker>
<p>Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Citizen</speaker>
<p>When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;<lb/>
When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;<lb/>
When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?<lb/>
Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.<lb/>
All may be well; but, if God sort it so,<lb/>
'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Citizen</speaker>
<p>Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:<lb/>
Ye cannot reason almost with a man<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, young YORK, QUEEN	ELIZABETH, and the DUCHESS OF YORK</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;<lb/>
At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:<lb/>
To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>I long with all my heart to see the prince:<lb/>
I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>But I hear, no; they say my son of York<lb/>
Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,<lb/>
My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow<lb/>
More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle<lb/>
Gloucester,<lb/>
'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'<lb/>
And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,<lb/>
Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold<lb/>
In him that did object the same to thee;<lb/>
He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,<lb/>
So long a-growing and so leisurely,<lb/>
That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,<lb/>
I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,<lb/>
To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast<lb/>
That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old<lb/>
'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.<lb/>
Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Grandam, his nurse.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Good madam, be not angry with the child.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Pitchers have ears.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter a Messenger</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Here comes a messenger. What news?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>How fares the prince?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Well, madam, and in health.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>What is thy news then?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,<lb/>
With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Who hath committed them?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>The mighty dukes<lb/>
Gloucester and Buckingham.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>For what offence?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;<lb/>
Why or for what these nobles were committed<lb/>
Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!<lb/>
The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;<lb/>
Insulting tyranny begins to jet<lb/>
Upon the innocent and aweless throne:<lb/>
Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!<lb/>
I see, as in a map, the end of all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,<lb/>
How many of you have mine eyes beheld!<lb/>
My husband lost his life to get the crown;<lb/>
And often up and down my sons were toss'd,<lb/>
For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:<lb/>
And being seated, and domestic broils<lb/>
Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.<lb/>
Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,<lb/>
Self against self: O, preposterous<lb/>
And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;<lb/>
Or let me die, to look on death no more!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.<lb/>
Madam, farewell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>I'll go along with you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>You have no cause.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</speaker>
<p>My gracious lady, go;<lb/>
And thither bear your treasure and your goods.<lb/>
For my part, I'll resign unto your grace<lb/>
The seal I keep: and so betide to me<lb/>
As well I tender you and all of yours!<lb/>
Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>The trumpets sound. Enter the young PRINCE EDWARD,	GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, CARDINAL, CATESBY, and others</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign<lb/>
The weary way hath made you melancholy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
<p>No, uncle; but our crosses on the way<lb/>
Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy<lb/>
I want more uncles here to welcome me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years<lb/>
Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit<lb/>
Nor more can you distinguish of a man<lb/>
Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,<lb/>
Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.<lb/>
Those uncles which you want were dangerous;<lb/>
Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,<lb/>
But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :<lb/>
God keep you from them, and from such false friends!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
<p>God keep me from false friends! but they were none.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter the Lord Mayor and his train</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord Mayor</speaker>
<p>God bless your grace with health and happy days!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
<p>I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.<lb/>
I thought my mother, and my brother York,<lb/>
Would long ere this have met us on the way<lb/>
Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not<lb/>
To tell us whether they will come or no!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter HASTINGS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
<p>Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>On what occasion, God he knows, not I,<lb/>
The queen your mother, and your brother York,<lb/>
Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince<lb/>
Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,<lb/>
But by his mother was perforce withheld.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Fie, what an indirect and peevish course<lb/>
Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace<lb/>
Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York<lb/>
Unto his princely brother presently?<lb/>
If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,<lb/>
And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL</speaker>
<p>My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory<lb/>
Can from his mother win the Duke of York,<lb/>
Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate<lb/>
To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid<lb/>
We should infringe the holy privilege<lb/>
Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land<lb/>
Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>You are too senseless&mdash;obstinate, my lord,<lb/>
Too ceremonious and traditional<lb/>
Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,<lb/>
You break not sanctuary in seizing him.<lb/>
The benefit thereof is always granted<lb/>
To those whose dealings have deserved the place,<lb/>
And those who have the wit to claim the place:<lb/>
This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;<lb/>
And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:<lb/>
Then, taking him from thence that is not there,<lb/>
You break no privilege nor charter there.<lb/>
Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;<lb/>
But sanctuary children ne'er till now.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CARDINAL</speaker>
<p>My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.<lb/>
Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>I go, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
<p>Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS</stage></p>


<p>
Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,<lb/>
Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Where it seems best unto your royal self.<lb/>
If I may counsel you, some day or two<lb/>
Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:<lb/>
Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit<lb/>
For your best health and recreation.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
<p>I do not like the Tower, of any place.<lb/>
Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;<lb/>
Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
<p>Is it upon record, or else reported<lb/>
Successively from age to age, he built it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Upon record, my gracious lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
<p>But say, my lord, it were not register'd,<lb/>
Methinks the truth should live from age to age,<lb/>
As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,<lb/>
Even to the general all-ending day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  So wise so young, they say, do never<lb/>
live long.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
<p>What say you, uncle?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>I say, without characters, fame lives long.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,<lb/>
I moralize two meanings in one word.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
<p>That Julius Caesar was a famous man;<lb/>
With what his valour did enrich his wit,<lb/>
His wit set down to make his valour live<lb/>
Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;<lb/>
For now he lives in fame, though not in life.<lb/>
I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>What, my gracious lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
<p>An if I live until I be a man,<lb/>
I'll win our ancient right in France again,<lb/>
Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Short summers lightly have a forward spring.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter young YORK, HASTINGS, and the CARDINAL</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
<p>Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
<p>Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:<lb/>
Too late he died that might have kept that title,<lb/>
Which by his death hath lost much majesty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,<lb/>
You said that idle weeds are fast in growth<lb/>
The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>He hath, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>And therefore is he idle?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Then is he more beholding to you than I.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>He may command me as my sovereign;<lb/>
But you have power in me as in a kinsman.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
<p>A beggar, brother?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;<lb/>
And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>A gentle cousin, were it light enough.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;<lb/>
In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>It is too heavy for your grace to wear.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>What, would you have my weapon, little lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>I would, that I might thank you as you call me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>How?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Little.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
<p>My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:<lb/>
Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:<lb/>
Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;<lb/>
Because that I am little, like an ape,<lb/>
He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!<lb/>
To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,<lb/>
He prettily and aptly taunts himself:<lb/>
So cunning and so young is wonderful.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>My lord, will't please you pass along?<lb/>
Myself and my good cousin Buckingham<lb/>
Will to your mother, to entreat of her<lb/>
To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
<p>My lord protector needs will have it so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Why, what should you fear?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YORK</speaker>
<p>Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:<lb/>
My grandam told me he was murdered there.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
<p>I fear no uncles dead.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Nor none that live, I hope.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRINCE EDWARD</speaker>
<p>An if they live, I hope I need not fear.<lb/>
But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,<lb/>
Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>A Sennet. Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM	and CATESBY</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Think you, my lord, this little prating York<lb/>
Was not incensed by his subtle mother<lb/>
To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;<lb/>
Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable<lb/>
He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.<lb/>
Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend<lb/>
As closely to conceal what we impart:<lb/>
Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;<lb/>
What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter<lb/>
To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,<lb/>
For the instalment of this noble duke<lb/>
In the seat royal of this famous isle?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CATESBY</speaker>
<p>He for his father's sake so loves the prince,<lb/>
That he will not be won to aught against him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CATESBY</speaker>
<p>He will do all in all as Hastings doth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,<lb/>
And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,<lb/>
How doth he stand affected to our purpose;<lb/>
And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,<lb/>
To sit about the coronation.<lb/>
If thou dost find him tractable to us,<lb/>
Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:<lb/>
If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,<lb/>
Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,<lb/>
And give us notice of his inclination:<lb/>
For we to-morrow hold divided councils,<lb/>
Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,<lb/>
His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries<lb/>
To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;<lb/>
And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,<lb/>
Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CATESBY</speaker>
<p>My good lords both, with all the heed I may.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CATESBY</speaker>
<p>You shall, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit CATESBY</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive<lb/>
Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:<lb/>
And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me<lb/>
The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables<lb/>
Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>And look to have it yielded with all willingness.<lb/>
Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards<lb/>
We may digest our complots in some form.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter a Messenger</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>What, ho! my lord!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Within]</stage></p><p>  Who knocks at the door?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>A messenger from the Lord Stanley.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter HASTINGS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>What is't o'clock?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Upon the stroke of four.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>So it should seem by that I have to say.<lb/>
First, he commends him to your noble lordship.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>And then?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>And then he sends you word<lb/>
He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:<lb/>
Besides, he says there are two councils held;<lb/>
And that may be determined at the one<lb/>
which may make you and him to rue at the other.<lb/>
Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,<lb/>
If presently you will take horse with him,<lb/>
And with all speed post with him toward the north,<lb/>
To shun the danger that his soul divines.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;<lb/>
Bid him not fear the separated councils<lb/>
His honour and myself are at the one,<lb/>
And at the other is my servant Catesby<lb/>
Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us<lb/>
Whereof I shall not have intelligence.<lb/>
Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:<lb/>
And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond<lb/>
To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers<lb/>
To fly the boar before the boar pursues,<lb/>
Were to incense the boar to follow us<lb/>
And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.<lb/>
Go, bid thy master rise and come to me<lb/>
And we will both together to the Tower,<lb/>
Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter CATESBY</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CATESBY</speaker>
<p>Many good morrows to my noble lord!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring<lb/>
What news, what news, in this our tottering state?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CATESBY</speaker>
<p>It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;<lb/>
And I believe twill never stand upright<lb/>
Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CATESBY</speaker>
<p>Ay, my good lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders<lb/>
Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.<lb/>
But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CATESBY</speaker>
<p>Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward<lb/>
Upon his party for the gain thereof:<lb/>
And thereupon he sends you this good news,<lb/>
That this same very day your enemies,<lb/>
The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,<lb/>
Because they have been still mine enemies:<lb/>
But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,<lb/>
To bar my master's heirs in true descent,<lb/>
God knows I will not do it, to the death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CATESBY</speaker>
<p>God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,<lb/>
That they who brought me in my master's hate<lb/>
I live to look upon their tragedy.<lb/>
I tell thee, Catesby&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CATESBY</speaker>
<p>What, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>Ere a fortnight make me elder,<lb/>

<p>'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,<lb/>
When men are unprepared and look not for it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out<lb/>
With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do<lb/>
With some men else, who think themselves as safe<lb/>
As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear<lb/>
To princely Richard and to Buckingham.<lb/>

<p>The princes both make high account of you;<lb/>

<p>
Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?<lb/>
Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STANLEY</speaker>
<p>My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:<lb/>
You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,<lb/>
I do not like these several councils, I.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>My lord,<lb/>
I hold my life as dear as you do yours;<lb/>
And never in my life, I do protest,<lb/>
Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:<lb/>
Think you, but that I know our state secure,<lb/>
I would be so triumphant as I am?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STANLEY</speaker>
<p>The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,<lb/>
Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,<lb/>
And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;<lb/>
But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.<lb/>
This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:<lb/>
Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!<lb/>
What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?<lb/>
To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD STANLEY</speaker>
<p>They, for their truth, might better wear their heads<lb/>
Than some that have accused them wear their hats.<lb/>
But come, my lord, let us away.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>

<p>
How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Pursuivant</speaker>
<p>The better that your lordship please to ask.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now<lb/>
Than when I met thee last where now we meet:<lb/>
Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,<lb/>
By the suggestion of the queen's allies;<lb/>
But now, I tell thee&mdash;keep it to thyself&mdash;<lb/>
This day those enemies are put to death,<lb/>
And I in better state than e'er I was.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Pursuivant</speaker>
<p>God hold it, to your honour's good content!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Priest</speaker>
<p>Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.<lb/>
I am in your debt for your last exercise;<lb/>
Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>He whispers in his ear</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter BUCKINGHAM</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?<lb/>
Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;<lb/>
Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>Good faith, and when I met this holy man,<lb/>
Those men you talk of came into my mind.<lb/>
What, go you toward the Tower?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay<lb/>
I shall return before your lordship thence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>

Come, will you go?<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>My lords, at once: the cause why we are met<lb/>
Is, to determine of the coronation.<lb/>
In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Are all things fitting for that royal time?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DERBY</speaker>
<p>It is, and wants but nomination.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BISHOP OF ELY</speaker>
<p>To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?<lb/>
Who is most inward with the royal duke?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BISHOP OF ELY</speaker>
<p>Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,<lb/>
But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,<lb/>
Than I of yours;<lb/>
Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.<lb/>
Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;<lb/>
But, for his purpose in the coronation.<lb/>
I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd<lb/>
His gracious pleasure any way therein:<lb/>
But you, my noble lords, may name the time;<lb/>
And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,<lb/>
Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BISHOP OF ELY</speaker>
<p>Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.<lb/>

<p>My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.<lb/>
I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,<lb/>
My absence doth neglect no great designs,<lb/>
Which by my presence might have been concluded.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Had not you come upon your cue, my lord<lb/>
William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,&mdash;<lb/>
I mean, your voice,&mdash;for crowning of the king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;<lb/>
His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.<lb/>

I saw good strawberries in your garden there<lb/>
I do beseech you send for some of them.<lb/>

Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,<lb/>
And finds the testy gentleman so hot,<lb/>
As he will lose his head ere give consent<lb/>
His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,<lb/>
Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.<lb/>

<p>We have not yet set down this day of triumph.<lb/>
To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BISHOP OF ELY</speaker>
<p>Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these<lb/>
strawberries.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;<lb/>
There's some conceit or other likes him well,<lb/>
When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.<lb/>
I think there's never a man in Christendom<lb/>
That can less hide his love or hate than he;<lb/>
For by his face straight shall you know his heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DERBY</speaker>
<p>What of his heart perceive you in his face<lb/>
By any likelihood he show'd to-day?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>Marry, that with no man here he is offended;<lb/>
For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.<lb/>

<p>I pray God he be not, I say.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>I pray you all, tell me what they deserve<lb/>
That do conspire my death with devilish plots<lb/>
Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd<lb/>
Upon my body with their hellish charms?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,<lb/>
Makes me most forward in this noble presence<lb/>
To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be<lb/>
I say, my lord, they have deserved death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:<lb/>
See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm<lb/>
Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:<lb/>
And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,<lb/>
Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,<lb/>
That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>If they have done this thing, my gracious lord&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>If I thou protector of this damned strumpet&mdash;<lb/>
Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor:<lb/>
Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,<lb/>
I will not dine until I see the same.<lb/>
Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:<lb/>
The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;<lb/>
For I, too fond, might have prevented this.<lb/>
Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;<lb/>
But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:<lb/>
Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,<lb/>
And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,<lb/>
As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.<lb/>
O, now I want the priest that spake to me:<lb/>
I now repent I told the pursuivant<lb/>
As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,<lb/>
How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,<lb/>
And I myself secure in grace and favour.<lb/>
O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse<lb/>
Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RATCLIFF</speaker>
<p>Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:<lb/>
Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker>
<p>O momentary grace of mortal men,<lb/>
Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!<lb/>
Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,<lb/>
Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,<lb/>
Ready, with every nod, to tumble down<lb/>
Into the fatal bowels of the deep.<lb/>

<p>Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LOVEL</speaker>
<p>Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,<lb/>
The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.<lb/>
I took him for the plainest harmless creature<lb/>
That breathed upon this earth a Christian;<lb/>
Made him my book wherein my soul recorded<lb/>
The history of all her secret thoughts:<lb/>
So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,<lb/>
That, his apparent open guilt omitted,<lb/>
I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,<lb/>
He lived from all attainder of suspect.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor<lb/>
That ever lived.<lb/>
Would you imagine, or almost believe,<lb/>
Were't not that, by great preservation,<lb/>
We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor<lb/>
This day had plotted, in the council-house<lb/>
To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord Mayor</speaker>
<p>What, had he so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>What, think You we are Turks or infidels?<lb/>
Or that we would, against the form of law,<lb/>
Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,<lb/>
But that the extreme peril of the case,<lb/>
The peace of England and our persons' safety,<lb/>
Enforced us to this execution?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord Mayor</speaker>
<p>Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;<lb/>
And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,<lb/>
To warn false traitors from the like attempts.<lb/>
I never look'd for better at his hands,<lb/>
After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Yet had not we determined he should die,<lb/>
Until your lordship came to see his death;<lb/>
Which now the loving haste of these our friends,<lb/>
Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:<lb/>
Because, my lord, we would have had you heard<lb/>
The traitor speak, and timorously confess<lb/>
The manner and the purpose of his treason;<lb/>
That you might well have signified the same<lb/>
Unto the citizens, who haply may<lb/>
Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord Mayor</speaker>
<p>But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,<lb/>
As well as I had seen and heard him speak<lb/>
And doubt you not, right noble princes both,<lb/>
But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens<lb/>
With all your just proceedings in this cause.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,<lb/>
To avoid the carping censures of the world.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>But since you come too late of our intents,<lb/>
Yet witness what you hear we did intend:<lb/>
And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.<lb/>

<p>Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.<lb/>
The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:<lb/>
There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,<lb/>
Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:<lb/>
Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,<lb/>
Only for saying he would make his son<lb/>
Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,<lb/>
Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.<lb/>
Moreover, urge his hateful luxury<lb/>
And bestial appetite in change of lust;<lb/>
Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,<lb/>
Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,<lb/>
Without control, listed to make his prey.<lb/>
Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:<lb/>
Tell them, when that my mother went with child<lb/>
Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York<lb/>
My princely father then had wars in France<lb/>
And, by just computation of the time,<lb/>
Found that the issue was not his begot;<lb/>
Which well appeared in his lineaments,<lb/>
Being nothing like the noble duke my father:<lb/>
But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,<lb/>
Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>

<p>This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;<lb/>
Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,<lb/>
That it may be this day read over in Paul's.<lb/>
And mark how well the sequel hangs together:<lb/>
Eleven hours I spent to write it over,<lb/>
For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;<lb/>
The precedent was full as long a-doing:<lb/>
And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,<lb/>
Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty<lb/>
Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,<lb/>
That seeth not this palpable device?<lb/>
Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?<lb/>
Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>How now, my lord, what say the citizens?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,<lb/>
The citizens are mum and speak not a word.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,<lb/>
And his contract by deputy in France;<lb/>
The insatiate greediness of his desires,<lb/>
And his enforcement of the city wives;<lb/>
His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,<lb/>
As being got, your father then in France,<lb/>
His resemblance, being not like the duke;<lb/>
Withal I did infer your lineaments,<lb/>
Being the right idea of your father,<lb/>
Both in your form and nobleness of mind;<lb/>
Laid open all your victories in Scotland,<lb/>
Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,<lb/>
Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:<lb/>
Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose<lb/>
Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse<lb/>
And when mine oratory grew to an end<lb/>
I bid them that did love their country's good<lb/>
Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Ah! and did they so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>No, so God help me, they spake not a word;<lb/>
But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,<lb/>
Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.<lb/>
Which when I saw, I reprehended them;<lb/>
And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:<lb/>
His answer was, the people were not wont<lb/>
To be spoke to but by the recorder.<lb/>
Then he was urged to tell my tale again,<lb/>
'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'<lb/>
But nothing spake in warrant from himself.<lb/>
When he had done, some followers of mine own,<lb/>
At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,<lb/>
And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'<lb/>
And thus I took the vantage of those few,<lb/>
'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;<lb/>
'This general applause and loving shout<lb/>
Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'<lb/>
And even here brake off, and came away.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>No, by my troth, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;<lb/>
Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:<lb/>
And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,<lb/>
And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;<lb/>
For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:<lb/>
And be not easily won to our request:<lb/>
Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>I go; and if you plead as well for them<lb/>
As I can say nay to thee for myself,<lb/>
No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit GLOUCESTER</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter the Lord Mayor and Citizens</stage></p>


<p>
Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;<lb/>
I think the duke will not be spoke withal.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter CATESBY</stage></p>


<p>
Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,<lb/>
What says he?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CATESBY</speaker>
<p>My lord: he doth entreat your grace;<lb/>
To visit him to-morrow or next day:<lb/>
He is within, with two right reverend fathers,<lb/>
Divinely bent to meditation;<lb/>
And no worldly suit would he be moved,<lb/>
To draw him from his holy exercise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;<lb/>
Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,<lb/>
In deep designs and matters of great moment,<lb/>
No less importing than our general good,<lb/>
Are come to have some conference with his grace.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CATESBY</speaker>
<p>I'll tell him what you say, my lord.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!<lb/>
He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,<lb/>
But on his knees at meditation;<lb/>
Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,<lb/>
But meditating with two deep divines;<lb/>
Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,<lb/>
But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:<lb/>
Happy were England, would this gracious prince<lb/>
Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:<lb/>
But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord Mayor</speaker>
<p>Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>I fear he will.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter CATESBY</stage></p>


<p>
How now, Catesby, what says your lord?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CATESBY</speaker>
<p>My lord,<lb/>
He wonders to what end you have assembled<lb/>
Such troops of citizens to speak with him,<lb/>
His grace not being warn'd thereof before:<lb/>
My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Sorry I am my noble cousin should<lb/>
Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:<lb/>
By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;<lb/>
And so once more return and tell his grace.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit CATESBY</stage></p>


<p>
When holy and devout religious men<lb/>
Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,<lb/>
So sweet is zealous contemplation.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two Bishops.	CATESBY returns</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord Mayor</speaker>
<p>See, where he stands between two clergymen!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,<lb/>
To stay him from the fall of vanity:<lb/>
And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,<lb/>
True ornaments to know a holy man.<lb/>
Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,<lb/>
Lend favourable ears to our request;<lb/>
And pardon us the interruption<lb/>
Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>My lord, there needs no such apology:<lb/>
I rather do beseech you pardon me,<lb/>
Who, earnest in the service of my God,<lb/>
Neglect the visitation of my friends.<lb/>
But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,<lb/>
And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>I do suspect I have done some offence<lb/>
That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,<lb/>
And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,<lb/>
At our entreaties, to amend that fault!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Then know, it is your fault that you resign<lb/>
The supreme seat, the throne majestical,<lb/>
The scepter'd office of your ancestors,<lb/>
Your state of fortune and your due of birth,<lb/>
The lineal glory of your royal house,<lb/>
To the corruption of a blemished stock:<lb/>
Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,<lb/>
Which here we waken to our country's good,<lb/>
This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;<lb/>
Her face defaced with scars of infamy,<lb/>
Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,<lb/>
And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf<lb/>
Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.<lb/>
Which to recure, we heartily solicit<lb/>
Your gracious self to take on you the charge<lb/>
And kingly government of this your land,<lb/>
Not as protector, steward, substitute,<lb/>
Or lowly factor for another's gain;<lb/>
But as successively from blood to blood,<lb/>
Your right of birth, your empery, your own.<lb/>
For this, consorted with the citizens,<lb/>
Your very worshipful and loving friends,<lb/>
And by their vehement instigation,<lb/>
In this just suit come I to move your grace.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>I know not whether to depart in silence,<lb/>
Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.<lb/>
Best fitteth my degree or your condition<lb/>
If not to answer, you might haply think<lb/>
Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded<lb/>
To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,<lb/>
Which fondly you would here impose on me;<lb/>
If to reprove you for this suit of yours,<lb/>
So season'd with your faithful love to me.<lb/>
Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.<lb/>
Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,<lb/>
And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,<lb/>
Definitively thus I answer you.<lb/>
Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert<lb/>
Unmeritable shuns your high request.<lb/>
First if all obstacles were cut away,<lb/>
And that my path were even to the crown,<lb/>
As my ripe revenue and due by birth<lb/>
Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,<lb/>
So mighty and so many my defects,<lb/>
As I had rather hide me from my greatness,<lb/>
Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,<lb/>
Than in my greatness covet to be hid,<lb/>
And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.<lb/>
But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,<lb/>
And much I need to help you, if need were;<lb/>
The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,<lb/>
Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,<lb/>
Will well become the seat of majesty,<lb/>
And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.<lb/>
On him I lay what you would lay on me,<lb/>
The right and fortune of his happy stars;<lb/>
Which God defend that I should wring from him!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;<lb/>
But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,<lb/>
All circumstances well considered.<lb/>
You say that Edward is your brother's son:<lb/>
So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;<lb/>
For first he was contract to Lady Lucy&mdash;<lb/>
Your mother lives a witness to that vow&mdash;<lb/>
And afterward by substitute betroth'd<lb/>
To Bona, sister to the King of France.<lb/>
These both put by a poor petitioner,<lb/>
A care-crazed mother of a many children,<lb/>
A beauty-waning and distressed widow,<lb/>
Even in the afternoon of her best days,<lb/>
Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,<lb/>
Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts<lb/>
To base declension and loathed bigamy<lb/>
By her, in his unlawful bed, he got<lb/>
This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.<lb/>
More bitterly could I expostulate,<lb/>
Save that, for reverence to some alive,<lb/>
I give a sparing limit to my tongue.<lb/>
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self<lb/>
This proffer'd benefit of dignity;<lb/>
If non to bless us and the land withal,<lb/>
Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry<lb/>
From the corruption of abusing times,<lb/>
Unto a lineal true-derived course.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord Mayor</speaker>
<p>Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CATESBY</speaker>
<p>O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?<lb/>
I am unfit for state and majesty;<lb/>
I do beseech you, take it not amiss;<lb/>
I cannot nor I will not yield to you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>If you refuse it,&mdash;as, in love and zeal,<lb/>
Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;<lb/>
As well we know your tenderness of heart<lb/>
And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,<lb/>
Which we have noted in you to your kin,<lb/>
And egally indeed to all estates,&mdash;<lb/>
Yet whether you accept our suit or no,<lb/>
Your brother's son shall never reign our king;<lb/>
But we will plant some other in the throne,<lb/>
To the disgrace and downfall of your house:<lb/>
And in this resolution here we leave you.&mdash;<lb/>
Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit BUCKINGHAM with the Citizens</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CATESBY</speaker>
<p>Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANOTHER</speaker>
<p>Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Would you enforce me to a world of care?<lb/>
Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,<lb/>
But penetrable to your. kind entreats,<lb/>
Albeit against my conscience and my soul.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest</stage></p>


<p>
Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,<lb/>
Since you will buckle fortune on my back,<lb/>
To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,<lb/>
I must have patience to endure the load:<lb/>
But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach<lb/>
Attend the sequel of your imposition,<lb/>
Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me<lb/>
From all the impure blots and stains thereof;<lb/>
For God he knows, and you may partly see,<lb/>
How far I am from the desire thereof.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord Mayor</speaker>
<p>God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>In saying so, you shall but say the truth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Then I salute you with this kingly title:<lb/>
Long live Richard, England's royal king!<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord Mayor, Citizens</speaker>
<p>Amen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Even when you please, since you will have it so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:<lb/>
And so most joyfully we take our leave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GLOUCESTER</speaker>
<p>Come, let us to our holy task again.<lb/>
Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet<lb/>
Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?<lb/>
Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,<lb/>
On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.<lb/>
Daughter, well met.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>God give your graces both<lb/>
A happy and a joyful time of day!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>As much to you, good sister! Whither away?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,<lb/>
Upon the like devotion as yourselves,<lb/>
To gratulate the gentle princes there.<lb/>

<p>Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.<lb/>

And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.<lb/>
Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,<lb/>
How doth the prince, and my young son of York?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRAKENBURY</speaker>
<p>Right well, dear madam. By your patience,<lb/>
I may not suffer you to visit them;<lb/>
The king hath straitly charged the contrary.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>The king! why, who's that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRAKENBURY</speaker>
<p>I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>The Lord protect him from that kingly title!<lb/>
Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?<lb/>
I am their mother; who should keep me from them?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>I am their fathers mother; I will see them.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:<lb/>
Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame<lb/>
And take thy office from thee, on my peril.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BRAKENBURY</speaker>
<p>No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:<lb/>
I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter LORD STANLEY</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD STANLEY</speaker>
<p>Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,<lb/>
And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,<lb/>
And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To LADY ANNE</stage></p>


<p>
Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,<lb/>
There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart<lb/>
May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon<lb/>
With this dead-killing news!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DORSET</speaker>
<p>Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!<lb/>
Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;<lb/>
Thy mother's name is ominous to children.<lb/>
If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,<lb/>
And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell<lb/>
Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,<lb/>
Lest thou increase the number of the dead;<lb/>
And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,<lb/>
Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD STANLEY</speaker>
<p>Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.<lb/>
Take all the swift advantage of the hours;<lb/>
You shall have letters from me to my son<lb/>
To meet you on the way, and welcome you.<lb/>
Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>O ill-dispersing wind of misery!<lb/>
O my accursed womb, the bed of death!<lb/>
A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,<lb/>
Whose unavoided eye is murderous.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORD STANLEY</speaker>
<p>Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>And I in all unwillingness will go.<lb/>
I would to God that the inclusive verge<lb/>
Of golden metal that must round my brow<lb/>
Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!<lb/>
Anointed let me be with deadly venom,<lb/>
And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory<lb/>
To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>No! why?  When he that is my husband now<lb/>
Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,<lb/>
When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands<lb/>
Which issued from my other angel husband<lb/>
And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;<lb/>
O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,<lb/>
This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,<lb/>
For making me, so young, so old a widow!<lb/>
And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;<lb/>
And be thy wife&mdash;if any be so mad&mdash;<lb/>
As miserable by the life of thee<lb/>
As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!<lb/>
Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,<lb/>
Even in so short a space, my woman's heart<lb/>
Grossly grew captive to his honey words<lb/>
And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,<lb/>
Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;<lb/>
For never yet one hour in his bed<lb/>
Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,<lb/>
But have been waked by his timorous dreams.<lb/>
Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;<lb/>
And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY ANNE</speaker>
<p>Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p><stage>[To DORSET]</stage></p><p>
Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee!<lb/>

<p>
Go thou to Richard, and good angels guard thee!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To QUEEN ELIZABETH</stage></p>


<p>
Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee!<lb/>
I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!<lb/>
Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,<lb/>
And each hour's joy wrecked with a week of teen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.<lb/>
Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes<lb/>
Whom envy hath immured within your walls!<lb/>
Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!<lb/>
Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow<lb/>
For tender princes, use my babies well!<lb/>
So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.<lb/>

<p>Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>My gracious sovereign?<lb/>

<p>Give me thy hand.<lb/>

Thus high, by thy advice<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,<lb/>

Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.<lb/>

<p>Say on, my loving lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,<lb/>

<p>Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.<lb/>

<p>O bitter consequence,<lb/>
That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!'<lb/>
Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:<lb/>
Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;<lb/>
And I would have it suddenly perform'd.<lb/>
What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief.<lb/>

Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out<lb/>

But I had rather kill two enemies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,<lb/>
Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers<lb/>
Are they that I would have thee deal upon:<lb/>
Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYRREL</speaker>
<p>Let me have open means to come to them,<lb/>
And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel<lb/>
Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Whispers</stage></p>


<p>
There is no more but so: say it is done,<lb/>
And I will love thee, and prefer thee too.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYRREL</speaker>
<p>'Tis done, my gracious lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYRREL</speaker>
<p>Ye shall, my Lord.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p><p><stage>Re-enter BUCKINGHAM</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind<lb/>
The late demand that you did sound me in.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>I hear that news, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,<lb/>
For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;<lb/>
The earldom of Hereford and the moveables<lb/>
The which you promised I should possess.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey<lb/>
Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>What says your highness to my just demand?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>As I remember, Henry the Sixth<lb/>
Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,<lb/>
When Richmond was a little peevish boy.<lb/>
A king, perhaps, perhaps,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>My lord!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>How chance the prophet could not at that time<lb/>
Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>My lord, your promise for the earldom,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,<lb/>
The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,<lb/>
And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,<lb/>
Because a bard of Ireland told me once<lb/>
I should not live long after I saw Richmond.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>My Lord!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Ay, what's o'clock?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>I am thus bold to put your grace in mind<lb/>
Of what you promised me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Well, but what's o'clock?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Upon the stroke of ten.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Well, let it strike.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Why let it strike?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke<lb/>
Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.<lb/>
I am not in the giving vein to-day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Tut, tut,<lb/>
Thou troublest me; am not in the vein.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BUCKINGHAM</speaker>
<p>Is it even so? rewards he my true service<lb/>
With such deep contempt made I him king for this?<lb/>
O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone<lb/>
To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>TYRREL</speaker>
<p>The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.<lb/>
The most arch of piteous massacre<lb/>
That ever yet this land was guilty of.<lb/>
Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn<lb/>
To do this ruthless piece of butchery,<lb/>
Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,<lb/>
Melting with tenderness and kind compassion<lb/>
Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.<lb/>
'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'<lb/>
'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another<lb/>
Within their innocent alabaster arms:<lb/>
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,<lb/>
Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.<lb/>
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;<lb/>
Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;<lb/>
But O! the devil'&mdash;there the villain stopp'd<lb/>
Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered<lb/>
The most replenished sweet work of nature,<lb/>
That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'<lb/>
Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;<lb/>
They could not speak; and so I left them both,<lb/>
To bring this tidings to the bloody king.<lb/>
And here he comes.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter KING RICHARD III</stage></p>


<p>
All hail, my sovereign liege!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYRREL</speaker>
<p>If to have done the thing you gave in charge<lb/>
Beget your happiness, be happy then,<lb/>
For it is done, my lord.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>But didst thou see them dead?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYRREL</speaker>
<p>I did, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>And buried, gentle Tyrrel?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TYRREL</speaker>
<p>The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;<lb/>
But how or in what place I do not know.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,<lb/>
And thou shalt tell the process of their death.<lb/>
Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,<lb/>
And be inheritor of thy desire.<lb/>
Farewell till soon.<lb/>

The son of Clarence have I pent up close;<lb/>
His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;<lb/>
The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,<lb/>
And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.<lb/>
Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims<lb/>
At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,<lb/>
And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,<lb/>
To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.<lb/>

<p>Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;<lb/>
And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,<lb/>
Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Ely with Richmond troubles me more near<lb/>
Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.<lb/>
Come, I have heard that fearful commenting<lb/>
Is leaden servitor to dull delay;<lb/>
Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary<lb/>
Then fiery expedition be my wing,<lb/>

<p>So, now prosperity begins to mellow<lb/>
And drop into the rotten mouth of death.<lb/>
Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,<lb/>
To watch the waning of mine adversaries.<lb/>
A dire induction am I witness to,<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!<lb/>
My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!<lb/>
If yet your gentle souls fly in the air<lb/>
And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,<lb/>
Hover about me with your airy wings<lb/>
And hear your mother's lamentation!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Hover about her; say, that right for right<lb/>
Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>So many miseries have crazed my voice,<lb/>
That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,<lb/>
Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.<lb/>
Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,<lb/>
And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?<lb/>
When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?<lb/>

<p>When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,<lb/>
Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,<lb/>
Brief abstract and record of tedious days,<lb/>
Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Sitting down</stage></p>


<p>
Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave<lb/>
As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!<lb/>
Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.<lb/>
O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Sitting down by her</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>If ancient sorrow be most reverend,<lb/>
Give mine the benefit of seniory,<lb/>
And let my woes frown on the upper hand.<lb/>
If sorrow can admit society,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Sitting down with them</stage></p>


<p>
Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:<lb/>
I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;<lb/>
I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:<lb/>
Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;<lb/>
Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;<lb/>
I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.<lb/>
From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept<lb/>
A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:<lb/>
That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,<lb/>
To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,<lb/>
That foul defacer of God's handiwork,<lb/>
That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,<lb/>
That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,<lb/>
Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.<lb/>
O upright, just, and true-disposing God,<lb/>
How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur<lb/>
Preys on the issue of his mother's body,<lb/>
And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!<lb/>
God witness with me, I have wept for thine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,<lb/>
And now I cloy me with beholding it.<lb/>
Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward:<lb/>
Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;<lb/>
Young York he is but boot, because both they<lb/>
Match not the high perfection of my loss:<lb/>
Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;<lb/>
And the beholders of this tragic play,<lb/>
The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,<lb/>
Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.<lb/>
Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,<lb/>
Only reserved their factor, to buy souls<lb/>
And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,<lb/>
Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:<lb/>
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.<lb/>
To have him suddenly convey'd away.<lb/>
Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,<lb/>
That I may live to say, The dog is dead!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>O, thou didst prophesy the time would come<lb/>
That I should wish for thee to help me curse<lb/>
That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;<lb/>
I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;<lb/>
The presentation of but what I was;<lb/>
The flattering index of a direful pageant;<lb/>
One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;<lb/>
A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;<lb/>
A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,<lb/>
A sign of dignity, a garish flag,<lb/>
To be the aim of every dangerous shot,<lb/>
A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.<lb/>
Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?<lb/>
Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?<lb/>
Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?<lb/>
Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?<lb/>
Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?<lb/>
Decline all this, and see what now thou art:<lb/>
For happy wife, a most distressed widow;<lb/>
For joyful mother, one that wails the name;<lb/>
For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;<lb/>
For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;<lb/>
For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;<lb/>
For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;<lb/>
For one commanding all, obey'd of none.<lb/>
Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,<lb/>
And left thee but a very prey to time;<lb/>
Having no more but thought of what thou wert,<lb/>
To torture thee the more, being what thou art.<lb/>
Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not<lb/>
Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?<lb/>
Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;<lb/>
From which even here I slip my weary neck,<lb/>
And leave the burthen of it all on thee.<lb/>
Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:<lb/>
These English woes will make me smile in France.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,<lb/>
And teach me how to curse mine enemies!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;<lb/>
Compare dead happiness with living woe;<lb/>
Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,<lb/>
And he that slew them fouler than he is:<lb/>
Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:<lb/>
Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.<lb/>

<p>Then patiently hear my impatience.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Madam, I have a touch of your condition,<lb/>
Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>O, let me speak!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Do then: but I'll not hear.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>I will be mild and gentle in my speech.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,<lb/>
God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>And came I not at last to comfort you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,<lb/>
Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.<lb/>
A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;<lb/>
Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;<lb/>
Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,<lb/>
Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,<lb/>
Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,<lb/>
treacherous,<lb/>
More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:<lb/>
What comfortable hour canst thou name,<lb/>
That ever graced me in thy company?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd<lb/>
your grace<lb/>
To breakfast once forth of my company.<lb/>
If I be so disgracious in your sight,<lb/>
Let me march on, and not offend your grace.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>I prithee, hear me speak.<lb/>

For I shall never speak to thee again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>So.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUCHESS OF YORK</speaker>
<p>Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,<lb/>
Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,<lb/>
Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish<lb/>
And never look upon thy face again.<lb/>
Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;<lb/>
Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more<lb/>
Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!<lb/>
My prayers on the adverse party fight;<lb/>
And there the little souls of Edward's children<lb/>

Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;<lb/>

<p>Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse<lb/>
Abides in me; I say amen to all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>I have no more sons of the royal blood<lb/>
For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,<lb/>
They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;<lb/>
And therefore level not to hit their lives.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,<lb/>
Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>And must she die for this? O, let her live,<lb/>
And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;<lb/>
Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;<lb/>
Throw over her the veil of infamy:<lb/>
So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,<lb/>
I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>To save her life, I'll say she is not so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Her life is only safest in her birth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>And only in that safety died her brothers.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>All unavoided is the doom of destiny.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>True, when avoided grace makes destiny:<lb/>
My babes were destined to a fairer death,<lb/>
If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd<lb/>
Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.<lb/>
Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,<lb/>
Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:<lb/>
No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt<lb/>
Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,<lb/>
To revel in the entrails of my lambs.<lb/>
But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,<lb/>
My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys<lb/>
Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;<lb/>
And I, in such a desperate bay of death,<lb/>
Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,<lb/>
Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise<lb/>
And dangerous success of bloody wars,<lb/>
As I intend more good to you and yours,<lb/>
Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,<lb/>
To be discover'd, that can do me good?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>The advancement of your children, gentle lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>No, to the dignity and height of honour<lb/>
The high imperial type of this earth's glory.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Flatter my sorrows with report of it;<lb/>
Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,<lb/>
Canst thou demise to any child of mine?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,<lb/>
Will I withal endow a child of thine;<lb/>
So in the Lethe of thy angry soul<lb/>
Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs<lb/>
Which thou supposest I have done to thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness<lb/>
Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>What do you think?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:<lb/>
So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;<lb/>
And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:<lb/>
I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,<lb/>
And mean to make her queen of England.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Even he that makes her queen who should be else?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>What, thou?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>I, even I: what think you of it, madam?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>How canst thou woo her?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>That would I learn of you,<lb/>
As one that are best acquainted with her humour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>And wilt thou learn of me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Madam, with all my heart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,<lb/>
A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave<lb/>
Edward and York; then haply she will weep:<lb/>
Therefore present to her&mdash;as sometime Margaret<lb/>
Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,&mdash;<lb/>
A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain<lb/>
The purple sap from her sweet brother's body<lb/>
And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.<lb/>
If this inducement force her not to love,<lb/>
Send her a story of thy noble acts;<lb/>
Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,<lb/>
Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,<lb/>
Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way<lb/>
To win our daughter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>There is no other way<lb/>
Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,<lb/>
And not be Richard that hath done all this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Say that I did all this for love of her.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,<lb/>
Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Look, what is done cannot be now amended:<lb/>
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,<lb/>
Which after hours give leisure to repent.<lb/>
If I did take the kingdom from your sons,<lb/>
To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.<lb/>
If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,<lb/>
To quicken your increase, I will beget<lb/>
Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter<lb/>
A grandam's name is little less in love<lb/>
Than is the doting title of a mother;<lb/>
They are as children but one step below,<lb/>
Even of your mettle, of your very blood;<lb/>
Of an one pain, save for a night of groans<lb/>
Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.<lb/>
Your children were vexation to your youth,<lb/>
But mine shall be a comfort to your age.<lb/>
The loss you have is but a son being king,<lb/>
And by that loss your daughter is made queen.<lb/>
I cannot make you what amends I would,<lb/>
Therefore accept such kindness as I can.<lb/>
Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul<lb/>
Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,<lb/>
This fair alliance quickly shall call home<lb/>
To high promotions and great dignity:<lb/>
The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.<lb/>
Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;<lb/>
Again shall you be mother to a king,<lb/>
And all the ruins of distressful times<lb/>
Repair'd with double riches of content.<lb/>
What! we have many goodly days to see:<lb/>
The liquid drops of tears that you have shed<lb/>
Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,<lb/>
Advantaging their loan with interest<lb/>
Of ten times double gain of happiness.<lb/>
Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go<lb/>
Make bold her bashful years with your experience;<lb/>
Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale<lb/>
Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame<lb/>
Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess<lb/>
With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys<lb/>
And when this arm of mine hath chastised<lb/>
The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,<lb/>
Bound with triumphant garlands will I come<lb/>
And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;<lb/>
To whom I will retail my conquest won,<lb/>
And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>What were I best to say? her father's brother<lb/>
Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?<lb/>
Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?<lb/>
Under what title shall I woo for thee,<lb/>
That God, the law, my honour and her love,<lb/>
Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Say that the king, which may command, entreats.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>That at her hands which the king's King forbids.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>To wail the tide, as her mother doth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Say, I will love her everlastingly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>But how long shall that title 'ever' last?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>So long as hell and Richard likes of it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Be eloquent in my behalf to her.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;<lb/>
Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>I swear&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>By nothing; for this is no oath:<lb/>
The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;<lb/>
The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;<lb/>
The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.<lb/>
if something thou wilt swear to be believed,<lb/>
Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Now, by the world&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>My father's death&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Thy life hath that dishonour'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Then, by myself&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Thyself thyself misusest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Why then, by God&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>God's wrong is most of all.<lb/>
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,<lb/>
The unity the king thy brother made<lb/>
Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:<lb/>
If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,<lb/>
The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,<lb/>
Had graced the tender temples of my child,<lb/>
And both the princes had been breathing here,<lb/>
Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,<lb/>
Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.<lb/>
What canst thou swear by now?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>The time to come.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;<lb/>
For I myself have many tears to wash<lb/>
Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.<lb/>
The children live, whose parents thou hast<lb/>
slaughter'd,<lb/>
Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;<lb/>
The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,<lb/>
Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.<lb/>
Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast<lb/>
Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>As I intend to prosper and repent,<lb/>
So thrive I in my dangerous attempt<lb/>
Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!<lb/>
Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!<lb/>
Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!<lb/>
Be opposite all planets of good luck<lb/>
To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,<lb/>
Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,<lb/>
I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!<lb/>
In her consists my happiness and thine;<lb/>
Without her, follows to this land and me,<lb/>
To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,<lb/>
Death, desolation, ruin and decay:<lb/>
It cannot be avoided but by this;<lb/>
It will not be avoided but by this.<lb/>
Therefore, good mother,&mdash;I must can you so&mdash;<lb/>
Be the attorney of my love to her:<lb/>
Plead what I will be, not what I have been;<lb/>
Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:<lb/>
Urge the necessity and state of times,<lb/>
And be not peevish-fond in great designs.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Shall I forget myself to be myself?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>But thou didst kill my children.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>But in your daughter's womb I bury them:<lb/>
Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed<lb/>
Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>And be a happy mother by the deed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>QUEEN ELIZABETH</speaker>
<p>I go. Write to me very shortly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RATCLIFF</speaker>
<p>My gracious sovereign, on the western coast<lb/>
Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore<lb/>
Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,<lb/>
Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:<lb/>
'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;<lb/>
And there they hull, expecting but the aid<lb/>
Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.<lb/>

Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?<lb/>

What from your grace I shall deliver to him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>

The greatest strength and power he can make,<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STANLEY</speaker>
<p>None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;<lb/>
Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!<lb/>
Why dost thou run so many mile about,<lb/>
When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?<lb/>
Once more, what news?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STANLEY</speaker>
<p>Richmond is on the seas.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>There let him sink, and be the seas on him!<lb/>
White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STANLEY</speaker>
<p>I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>STANLEY</speaker>
<p>Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,<lb/>
He makes for England, there to claim the crown.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?<lb/>
Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?<lb/>
What heir of York is there alive but we?<lb/>
And who is England's king but great York's heir?<lb/>
Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STANLEY</speaker>
<p>Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Unless for that he comes to be your liege,<lb/>
You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.<lb/>
Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STANLEY</speaker>
<p>No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?<lb/>
Where are thy tenants and thy followers?<lb/>
Are they not now upon the western shore.<lb/>
Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STANLEY</speaker>
<p>No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north,<lb/>
When they should serve their sovereign in the west?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STANLEY</speaker>
<p>They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign:<lb/>
Please it your majesty to give me leave,<lb/>
I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace<lb/>
Where and what time your majesty shall please.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:<lb/>
I will not trust you, sir.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>STANLEY</speaker>
<p>Most mighty sovereign,<lb/>
You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:<lb/>
I never was nor never will be false.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Well,<lb/>
Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind<lb/>
Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm.<lb/>
Or else his head's assurance is but frail.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Here pitch our tents, even here in Bosworth field.<lb/>
My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SURREY</speaker>
<p>My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>My Lord of Norfolk,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORFOLK</speaker>
<p>Here, most gracious liege.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORFOLK</speaker>
<p>We must both give and take, my gracious lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight;<lb/>
But where to-morrow?  Well, all's one for that.<lb/>
Who hath descried the number of the foe?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORFOLK</speaker>
<p>Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Why, our battalion trebles that account:<lb/>
Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength,<lb/>
Which they upon the adverse party want.<lb/>
Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,<lb/>
Let us survey the vantage of the field<lb/>
Call for some men of sound direction<lb/>
Let's want no discipline, make no delay,<lb/>
For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter, on the other side of the field, RICHMOND,	Sir William Brandon, OXFORD, and others. Some of	the Soldiers pitch RICHMOND's tent</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RICHMOND</speaker>
<p>The weary sun hath made a golden set,<lb/>
And by the bright track of his fiery car,<lb/>
Gives signal, of a goodly day to-morrow.<lb/>
Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.<lb/>
Give me some ink and paper in my tent<lb/>
I'll draw the form and model of our battle,<lb/>
Limit each leader to his several charge,<lb/>
And part in just proportion our small strength.<lb/>
My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon,<lb/>
And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.<lb/>
The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment:<lb/>
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him<lb/>
And by the second hour in the morning<lb/>
Desire the earl to see me in my tent:<lb/>
Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st,<lb/>
Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BLUNT</speaker>
<p>Unless I have mista'en his colours much,<lb/>
Which well I am assured I have not done,<lb/>
His regiment lies half a mile at least<lb/>
South from the mighty power of the king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RICHMOND</speaker>
<p>If without peril it be possible,<lb/>
Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,<lb/>
And give him from me this most needful scroll.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BLUNT</speaker>
<p>Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-take it;<lb/>
And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RICHMOND</speaker>
<p>Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come gentlemen,<lb/>
Let us consult upon to-morrow's business<lb/>
In to our tent; the air is raw and cold.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CATESBY</speaker>
<p>It's supper-time, my lord;<lb/>
It's nine o'clock.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>I will not sup to-night.<lb/>
Give me some ink and paper.<lb/>
What, is my beaver easier than it was?<lb/>
And all my armour laid into my tent?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CATESBY</speaker>
<p>If is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;<lb/>
Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORFOLK</speaker>
<p>I go, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>

<p>My lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Send out a pursuivant at arms<lb/>
To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power<lb/>
Before sunrising, lest his son George fall<lb/>
Into the blind cave of eternal night.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit CATESBY</stage></p>


<p>
Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.<lb/>
Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.<lb/>
Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.<lb/>
Ratcliff!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RATCLIFF</speaker>
<p>My lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RATCLIFF</speaker>
<p>Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself,<lb/>
Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop<lb/>
Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:<lb/>
I have not that alacrity of spirit,<lb/>
Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have.<lb/>
Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RATCLIFF</speaker>
<p>It is, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Bid my guard watch; leave me.<lb/>
Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent<lb/>
And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.<lb/>

<p>Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RICHMOND</speaker>
<p>All comfort that the dark night can afford<lb/>
Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!<lb/>
Tell me, how fares our loving mother?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DERBY</speaker>
<p>I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother<lb/>
Who prays continually for Richmond's good:<lb/>
So much for that. The silent hours steal on,<lb/>
And flaky darkness breaks within the east.<lb/>
In brief,&mdash;for so the season bids us be,&mdash;<lb/>
Prepare thy battle early in the morning,<lb/>
And put thy fortune to the arbitrement<lb/>
Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.<lb/>
I, as I may&mdash;that which I would I cannot,&mdash;<lb/>
With best advantage will deceive the time,<lb/>
And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:<lb/>
But on thy side I may not be too forward<lb/>
Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,<lb/>
Be executed in his father's sight.<lb/>
Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time<lb/>
Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love<lb/>
And ample interchange of sweet discourse,<lb/>
Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon:<lb/>
God give us leisure for these rites of love!<lb/>
Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RICHMOND</speaker>
<p>Good lords, conduct him to his regiment:<lb/>
I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,<lb/>
Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,<lb/>
When I should mount with wings of victory:<lb/>
Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but RICHMOND</stage></p>


<p>
O Thou, whose captain I account myself,<lb/>
Look on my forces with a gracious eye;<lb/>
Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,<lb/>
That they may crush down with a heavy fall<lb/>
The usurping helmets of our adversaries!<lb/>
Make us thy ministers of chastisement,<lb/>
That we may praise thee in the victory!<lb/>
To thee I do commend my watchful soul,<lb/>
Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:<lb/>
Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!<lb/>

<p>
Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!<lb/>
Arm, fight, and conquer, for fair England's sake!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter the Ghosts of the two young Princes</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>of young Princes</speaker>
<p><stage>[To KING RICHARD III]</stage></p><p>
Dream on thy cousins smother'd in the Tower:<lb/>
Let us be led within thy bosom, Richard,<lb/>
And weigh thee down to ruin, shame, and death!<lb/>

But cheer thy heart, and be thou not dismay'd:<lb/>
God and good angel fight on Richmond's side;<lb/>
And Richard falls in height of all his pride.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>The Ghosts vanish</stage>



</p><p><stage>KING RICHARD III starts out of his dream</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Give me another horse: bind up my wounds.<lb/>
Have mercy, Jesu!&mdash;Soft! I did but dream.<lb/>
O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!<lb/>
The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.<lb/>
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.<lb/>
What do I fear?  myself?  there's none else by:<lb/>
Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.<lb/>
Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am:<lb/>
Then fly. What, from myself?   Great reason why:<lb/>
Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?<lb/>
Alack. I love myself. Wherefore?  for any good<lb/>
That I myself have done unto myself?<lb/>
O, no! alas, I rather hate myself<lb/>
For hateful deeds committed by myself!<lb/>
I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.<lb/>
Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.<lb/>
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,<lb/>
And every tongue brings in a several tale,<lb/>
And every tale condemns me for a villain.<lb/>
Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree<lb/>
Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree;<lb/>
All several sins, all used in each degree,<lb/>
Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!<lb/>
I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;<lb/>
And if I die, no soul shall pity me:<lb/>
Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself<lb/>
Find in myself no pity to myself?<lb/>
Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd<lb/>
Came to my tent; and every one did threat<lb/>
To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter RATCLIFF</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RATCLIFF</speaker>
<p>My lord!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>'Zounds! who is there?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RATCLIFF</speaker>
<p>Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock<lb/>
Hath twice done salutation to the morn;<lb/>
Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!<lb/>
What thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RATCLIFF</speaker>
<p>No doubt, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RATCLIFF</speaker>
<p>Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night<lb/>
Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard<lb/>
Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers<lb/>
Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.<lb/>
It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;<lb/>
Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,<lb/>
To see if any mean to shrink from me.<lb/>

<p>Good morrow, Richmond!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RICHMOND</speaker>
<p>Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,<lb/>
That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORDS</speaker>
<p>How have you slept, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RICHMOND</speaker>
<p>The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams<lb/>
That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,<lb/>
Have I since your departure had, my lords.<lb/>
Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,<lb/>
Came to my tent, and cried on victory:<lb/>
I promise you, my soul is very jocund<lb/>
In the remembrance of so fair a dream.<lb/>
How far into the morning is it, lords?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LORDS</speaker>
<p>Upon the stroke of four.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RICHMOND</speaker>
<p>Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>His oration to his soldiers</stage></p>


<p>
More than I have said, loving countrymen,<lb/>
The leisure and enforcement of the time<lb/>
Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,<lb/>
God and our good cause fight upon our side;<lb/>
The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,<lb/>
Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;<lb/>
Richard except, those whom we fight against<lb/>
Had rather have us win than him they follow:<lb/>
For what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen,<lb/>
A bloody tyrant and a homicide;<lb/>
One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;<lb/>
One that made means to come by what he hath,<lb/>
And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;<lb/>
Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil<lb/>
Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;<lb/>
One that hath ever been God's enemy:<lb/>
Then, if you fight against God's enemy,<lb/>
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;<lb/>
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,<lb/>
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;<lb/>
If you do fight against your country's foes,<lb/>
Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;<lb/>
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,<lb/>
Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;<lb/>
If you do free your children from the sword,<lb/>
Your children's children quit it in your age.<lb/>
Then, in the name of God and all these rights,<lb/>
Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.<lb/>
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt<lb/>
Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;<lb/>
But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt<lb/>
The least of you shall share his part thereof.<lb/>
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;<lb/>
God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RATCLIFF</speaker>
<p>That he was never trained up in arms.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>RATCLIFF</speaker>
<p>He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.'<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>He was in the right; and so indeed it is.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Clock striketh</stage></p>

Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar.<lb/>
Who saw the sun to-day?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RATCLIFF</speaker>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>Then he disdains to shine; for by the book<lb/>
He should have braved the east an hour ago<lb/>
A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RATCLIFF</speaker>
<p>My lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>The sun will not be seen to-day;<lb/>
The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.<lb/>
I would these dewy tears were from the ground.<lb/>
Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me<lb/>
More than to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven<lb/>
That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter NORFOLK</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORFOLK</speaker>
<p>Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.<lb/>

<p>Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse.<lb/>
Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:<lb/>
I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,<lb/>
And thus my battle shall be ordered:<lb/>
My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,<lb/>
Consisting equally of horse and foot;<lb/>
Our archers shall be placed in the midst<lb/>
John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,<lb/>
Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.<lb/>
They thus directed, we will follow<lb/>
In the main battle, whose puissance on either side<lb/>
Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.<lb/>
This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORFOLK</speaker>
<p>A good direction, warlike sovereign.<lb/>
This found I on my tent this morning.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reads]</stage></p><p>
'Jockey of Norfolk, be not too bold,<lb/>
For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.'<lb/>
A thing devised by the enemy.<lb/>
Go, gentleman, every man unto his charge<lb/>
Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls:<lb/>
Conscience is but a word that cowards use,<lb/>
Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:<lb/>
Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.<lb/>
March on, join bravely, let us to't pell-mell<lb/>
If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>His oration to his Army</stage></p>


<p>
What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?<lb/>
Remember whom you are to cope withal;<lb/>
A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,<lb/>
A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,<lb/>
Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth<lb/>
To desperate ventures and assured destruction.<lb/>
You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;<lb/>
You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,<lb/>
They would restrain the one, distain the other.<lb/>
And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,<lb/>
Long kept in Bretagne at our mother's cost?<lb/>
A milk-sop, one that never in his life<lb/>
Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?<lb/>
Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;<lb/>
Lash hence these overweening rags of France,<lb/>
These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;<lb/>
Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,<lb/>
For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves:<lb/>
If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,<lb/>
And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers<lb/>
Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,<lb/>
And in record, left them the heirs of shame.<lb/>
Shall these enjoy our lands?  lie with our wives?<lb/>
Ravish our daughters?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Drum afar off</stage></p>


<p>
Hark! I hear their drum.<lb/>
Fight, gentlemen of England! fight, bold yoemen!<lb/>
Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!<lb/>
Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;<lb/>
Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!<lb/>

<p>Off with his son George's head!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NORFOLK</speaker>
<p>My lord, the enemy is past the marsh<lb/>
After the battle let George Stanley die.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KING RICHARD III</speaker>
<p>A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:<lb/>
Advance our standards, set upon our foes<lb/>
Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,<lb/>
Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!<lb/>
Upon them! victory sits on our helms.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Alarum. Enter KING RICHARD III and RICHMOND; they	fight. KING RICHARD III is slain. Retreat and	flourish. Re-enter RICHMOND, DERBY bearing the	crown, with divers other Lords</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>RICHMOND</speaker>
<p>God and your arms be praised, victorious friends,<lb/>
The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DERBY</speaker>
<p>Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.<lb/>
Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty<lb/>
From the dead temples of this bloody wretch<lb/>
Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:<lb/>
Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RICHMOND</speaker>
<p>Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!<lb/>
But, tell me, is young George Stanley living?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DERBY</speaker>
<p>He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;<lb/>
Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RICHMOND</speaker>
<p>What men of name are slain on either side?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DERBY</speaker>
<p>John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,<lb/>
Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>RICHMOND</speaker>
<p>Inter their bodies as becomes their births:<lb/>
Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled<lb/>
That in submission will return to us:<lb/>
And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,<lb/>
We will unite the white rose and the red:<lb/>
Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,<lb/>
That long have frown'd upon their enmity!<lb/>
What traitor hears me, and says not amen?<lb/>
England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;<lb/>
The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,<lb/>
The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,<lb/>
The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:<lb/>
All this divided York and Lancaster,<lb/>
Divided in their dire division,<lb/>
O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,<lb/>
The true succeeders of each royal house,<lb/>
By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!<lb/>
And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.<lb/>
Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,<lb/>
With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!<lb/>
Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,<lb/>
That would reduce these bloody days again,<lb/>
And make poor England weep in streams of blood!<lb/>
Let them not live to taste this land's increase<lb/>
That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!<lb/>
Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:<lb/>
That she may long live here, God say amen!<lb/>
