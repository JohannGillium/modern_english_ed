<figDesc>A black and white drawing by Jay Hambidge in which a two-story
building stands in the middle of a flat landscape.  A sign reading
"The Palace Hotel" is in the far right background of the drawing.
</figDesc>
</figure>
</p>
<p>THE Palace Hotel at Fort Romper was painted a light blue, a
shade that is on the legs of a kind of heron, causing the bird to
declare its position against any background.  The Palace Hotel,
then, was always screaming and howling in a way that made the
dazzling winter landscape of Nebraska seem only a gray swampish
hush.  It stood alone on the prairie, and when the snow was falling
the town two hundred yards away was not visible.  But when the
traveler alighted at the railway station he was obliged to pass the
Palace Hotel before he could come upon the company of low clap-board houses which composed Fort Romper, and it was not to be
thought that any traveler could pass the Palace Hotel without
looking at it.  Pat Scully, the proprietor, had proved himself a
master of strategy when he chose his paints.  It is true that on
clear days, when the great trans-continental expresses, long lines
of swaying Pullmans, swept through Fort Romper, passengers were
overcome at the sight, and the cult that knows the brown-reds and
the subdivisions of the dark greens of the East expressed shame,
pity, horror, in a laugh.  But to the citizens of this prairie
town, and to the people who would naturally stop there, Pat Scully
had performed a feat.  With this opulence and splendor, these
creeds, classes, egotisms, that streamed through Romper on the
rails day after day, they had no color in common.
</p><p>As if the displayed delights of such a blue hotel were not
sufficiently enticing, it was Scully's habit to go every morning
and evening to meet the leisurely trains that stopped at Romper and
work his seductions upon any man that he might see wavering,
gripsack in hand.
</p><p>One morning, when a snow-crusted engine dragged its long
string of freight cars and its one passenger coach to the station,
Scully performed the marvel of catching three men.  One was a shaky
and quick-eyed Swede, with a great shining cheap valise; one was a
tall bronzed cowboy, who was on his way to a ranch near the Dakota
line; one was a little silent man from the East, who didn't look
it, and didn't announce it.  Scully practically made them
prisoners.  He was so nimble and merry and kindly that each
probably felt it would be the height of brutality to try to escape.
They trudged off over the creaking board sidewalks in the wake of
the eager little Irishman.  He wore a heavy fur cap squeezed
tightly down on his head.  It caused his two red ears to stick out
stiffly, as if they were made of tin.
</p><p>At last Scully, elaborately, with boisterous hospitality,
conducted them through the portals of the blue hotel.  The room
which they entered was small.  It seemed to be merely a proper
temple for an enormous stove, which, in the center, was humming
with godlike violence.  At various points on its surface the iron
had become luminous and glowed yellow from the heat.  Beside the
stove Scully's son Johnnie was playing High-Five with an old farmer
who had whiskers both gray and sandy.  They were quarreling.
Frequently the old farmer turned his face toward a box of sawdust&mdash;
colored brown from tobacco juice&mdash;that was behind the stove, and
spat with an air of great impatience and irritation.  With a loud
flourish of words Scully destroyed the game of cards, and bustled
his son upstairs with part of the baggage of the new guests.  He
himself conducted them to three basins of the coldest water in the
world.  The cowboy and the Easterner burnished themselves fiery red
with this water, until it seemed to be some kind of a metal polish.
The Swede, however, merely dipped his fingers gingerly and with
trepidation.  It was notable that throughout this series of small
ceremonies the three travelers were made to feel that Scully was
very benevolent.  He was conferring great favors upon them.  He
handed the towel from one to the other with an air of philanthropic
impulse.
</p><p>Afterward they went to the first room, and, sitting about the
stove, listened to Scully's officious clamor at his daughters, who
were preparing the midday meal.  They reflected in the silence of
experienced men who tread carefully amid new people.  Nevertheless,
the old farmer, stationary, invincible in his chair near the
warmest part of the stove, turned his face from the sawdust box
frequently and addressed a glowing commonplace to the strangers.
Usually he was answered in short but adequate sentences by either
the cowboy or the Easterner.  The Swede said nothing.  He seemed to
be occupied in making furtive estimates of each man in the room.
One might have thought that he had the sense of silly suspicion
which comes to guilt.  He resembled a badly frightened man.
</p><p>Later, at dinner, he spoke a little, addressing his
conversation entirely to Scully.  He volunteered that he had come
from New York, where for ten years he had worked as a tailor.
These facts seemed to strike Scully as fascinating, and afterward
he volunteered that he had lived at Romper for fourteen years.  The
Swede asked about the crops and the price of labor.  He seemed
barely to listen to Scully's extended replies.  His eyes continued
to rove from man to man.
</p><p>Finally, with a laugh and a wink, he said that some of these
Western communities were very dangerous; and after his statement he
straightened his legs under the table, tilted his head, and laughed
again, loudly.  It was plain that the demonstration had no meaning
to the others.  They looked at him wondering and in silence.</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="2" id="d5">
<head>II</head>

<p>As the men trooped heavily back into the front room, the two
little windows presented views of a turmoiling sea of snow.  The
huge arms of the wind were making attempts&mdash;mighty, circular,
futile&mdash;to embrace the flakes as they sped.  A gate-post like a
still man with a blanched face stood aghast amid this profligate
fury.  In a hearty voice Scully announced the presence of a
blizzard.  The guests of the blue hotel, lighting their pipes,
assented with grunts of lazy masculine contentment.  No island of
the sea could be exempt in the degree of this little room with its
humming stove.  Johnnie, son of Scully, in a tone which defined his
opinion of his ability as a card-player, challenged the old farmer
of both gray and sandy whiskers to a game of High-Five.  The farmer
agreed with a contemptuous and bitter scoff.  They sat close to the
stove, and squared their knees under a wide board.  The cowboy and
the Easterner watched the game with interest.  The Swede remained
near the window, aloof, but with a countenance that showed signs of
an inexplicable excitement.
</p><p>The play of Johnnie and the gray-beard was suddenly ended by
another quarrel.  The old man arose while casting a look of heated
scorn at his adversary.  He slowly buttoned his coat, and then
stalked with fabulous dignity from the room.  In the discreet
silence of all other men the Swede laughed.  His laughter rang
somehow childish.  Men by this time had begun to look at him
askance, as if they wished to inquire what ailed him.
</p><p>A new game was formed jocosely.  The cowboy volunteered to
become the partner of Johnnie, and they all then turned to ask the
Swede to throw in his lot with the little Easterner.  He asked some
questions about the game, and learning that it wore many names, and
that he had played it when it was under an alias, he accepted the
invitation.  He strode toward the men nervously, as if he expected
to be assaulted.  Finally, seated, he gazed from face to face and
laughed shrilly.  This laugh was so strange that the Easterner
looked up quickly, the cowboy sat intent and with his mouth open,
and Johnnie paused, holding the cards with still fingers.
</p><p>Afterward there was a short silence.  Then Johnnie said:
"Well, let's get at it.  Come on now!"  They pulled their chairs
forward until their knees were bunched under the board.  They began
to play, and their interest in the game caused the others to forget
the manner of the Swede.
</p><p>The cowboy was a board-whacker.  Each time that he held
superior cards he whanged them, one by one, with exceeding force,
down upon the improvised table, and took the tricks with a glowing
air of prowess and pride that sent thrills of indignation into the
hearts of his opponents.  A game with a board-whacker in it is sure
to become intense.  The countenances of the Easterner and the Swede
were miserable whenever the cowboy thundered down his aces and
kings, while Johnnie, his eyes gleaming with joy, chuckled and
chuckled.
</p><p>Because of the absorbing play none considered the strange ways
of the Swede.  They paid strict heed to the game.  Finally, during
a lull caused by a new deal, the Swede suddenly addressed Johnnie:
"I suppose there have been a good many men killed in this room."
The jaws of the others dropped and they looked at him.
</p><p>"What in hell are you talking about?" said Johnnie.
</p><p>The Swede laughed again his blatant laugh, full of a kind of
false courage and defiance.  "Oh, you know what I mean all right,"
he answered.
</p><p>"I'm a liar if I do!" Johnnie protested.  The card was halted,
and the men stared at the Swede.  Johnnie evidently felt that as
the son of the proprietor he should make a direct inquiry.  "Now,
what might you be drivin' at, mister?" he asked.  The Swede winked
at him.  It was a wink full of cunning.  His fingers shook on the
edge of the board.  "Oh, maybe you think I have been to nowheres.
Maybe you think I'm a tenderfoot?"
</p><p>"I don't know nothin' about you," answered Johnnie, "and I
don't give a damn where you've been.  All I got to say is that I
don't know what you're driving at.  There hain't never been nobody
killed in this room."
</p><p>The cowboy, who had been steadily gazing at the Swede, then
spoke.  "What's wrong with you, mister?"
</p><p>Apparently it seemed to the Swede that he was formidably
menaced.  He shivered and turned white near the corners of his
mouth.  He sent an appealing glance in the direction of the little
Easterner.  During these moments he did not forget to wear his air
of advanced pot-valor.  "They say they don't know what I mean," he
remarked mockingly to the Easterner.
</p><p>The latter answered after prolonged and cautious reflection.
"I don't understand you," he said, impassively.
</p><p>The Swede made a movement then which announced that he thought
he had encountered treachery from the only quarter where he had
expected sympathy if not help.  "Oh, I see you are all against me.
I see&mdash;"
</p><p>The cowboy was in a state of deep stupefaction.  "Say," he
cried, as he tumbled the deck violently down upon the board.  "Say,
what are you gittin' at, hey?"
</p><p>The Swede sprang up with the celerity of a man escaping from
a snake on the floor.  "I don't want to fight!" he shouted.  "I
don't want to fight!"
</p><p>The cowboy stretched his long legs indolently and
deliberately.  His hands were in his pockets.  He spat into the
sawdust box.  "Well, who the hell thought you did?" he inquired.
</p><p>The Swede backed rapidly toward a corner of the room.  His
hands were out protectingly in front of his chest, but he was
making an obvious struggle to control his fright.  "Gentlemen," he
quavered, "I suppose I am going to be killed before I can leave
this house!  I suppose I am going to be killed before I can leave
this house."  In his eyes was the dying swan look.  Through the
windows could be seen the snow turning blue in the shadow of dusk.
The wind tore at the house and some loose thing beat regularly
against the clap-boards like a spirit tapping.
</p><p>A door opened, and Scully himself entered.  He paused in
surprise as he noted the tragic attitude of the Swede.  Then he
said: "What's the matter here?"
</p><p>The Swede answered him swiftly and eagerly: "These men are
going to kill me."
</p><p>"Kill you!" ejaculated Scully.  "Kill you!  What are you
talkin'?"
</p><p>The Swede made the gesture of a martyr.
</p><p>Scully wheeled sternly upon his son.  "What is this, Johnnie?"
</p><p>The lad had grown sullen.  "Damned if I know," he answered.
"I can't make no sense to it."  He began to shuffle the cards,
fluttering them together with an angry snap.  "He says a good many
men have been killed in this room, or something like that.  And he
says he's goin' to be killed here too.  I don't know what ails him.
He's crazy, I shouldn't wonder."
</p><p>Scully then looked for explanation to the cowboy, but the
cowboy simply shrugged his shoulders.
</p><p>"Kill you?" said Scully again to the Swede.  "Kill you?  Man,
you're off your nut."
</p><p>"Oh, I know," burst out the Swede.  "I know what will happen.
Yes, I'm crazy&mdash;yes.  Yes, of course, I'm crazy&mdash;yes.  But I know
one thing&mdash;"  There was a sort of sweat of misery and terror upon
his face.  "I know I won't get out of here alive."</p>

</p>
<p>The cowboy drew a deep breath, as if his mind was passing into
the last stages of dissolution.  "Well, I'm dog-goned," he
whispered to himself.
</p><p>Scully wheeled suddenly and faced his son.  "You've been
troublin' this man!"
</p><p>Johnnie's voice was loud with its burden of grievance.  "Why,
good Gawd, I ain't done nothin' to 'im."
</p><p>The Swede broke in.  "Gentlemen, do not disturb yourselves.
I will leave this house.  I will go 'way because&mdash;"  He accused
them dramatically with his glance.  "Because I do not want to be
killed."
</p><p>Scully was furious with his son.  "Will you tell me what is
the matter, you young divil?  What's the matter, anyhow?  Speak
out!"
</p><p>"Blame it," cried Johnnie in despair, "don't I tell you I
don't know.  He&mdash;he says we want to kill him, and that's all I
know.  I can't tell what ails him."
</p><p>The Swede continued to repeat: "Never mind, Mr. Scully, never
mind.  I will leave this house.  I will go away, because I do not
wish to be killed.  Yes, of course, I am crazy&mdash;yes.  But I know
one thing!  I will go away.  I will leave this house.  Never mind,
Mr. Scully, never mind.  I will go away."
</p><p>"You will not go 'way," said Scully.  "You will not go 'way
until I hear the reason of this business.  If anybody has troubled
you I will take care of him.  This is my house.  You are under my
roof, and I will not allow any peaceable man to be troubled here.
He cast a terrible eye upon Johnnie, the cowboy, and the Easterner.
</p><p>"Never mind, Mr. Scully; never mind.  I will go 'way.  I do
not wish to be killed."  The Swede moved toward the door, which
opened upon the stairs.  It was evidently his intention to go at
once for his baggage.
</p><p>"No, no," shouted Scully peremptorily; but the white-faced man
slid by him and disappeared.  "Now," said Scully severely, "what
does this mane?"
</p><p>Johnnie and the cowboy cried together: "Why, we didn't do
nothin' to 'im!"
</p><p>Scully's eyes were cold.  "No," he said, "you didn't?"
</p><p>Johnnie swore a deep oath.  "Why, this is the wildest loon I
ever see.  We didn't do nothin' at all.  We were jest sittin' here
playin' cards and he&mdash;"
</p><p>The father suddenly spoke to the Easterner.  "Mr. Blanc," he
asked, "what has these boys been doin'?"
</p><p>The Easterner reflected again.  "I didn't see anything wrong
at all," he said at last slowly.
</p><p>Scully began to howl.  "But what does it mane?"  He stared
ferociously at his son.  "I have a mind to lather you for this, me
boy."
</p><p>Johnnie was frantic.  "Well, what have I done?" he bawled at
his father.</p>
</div2>


<div2 type="section" n="3" id="d6">
<head>III</head>

<p>"I THINK you are tongue-tied," said Scully finally to his son,
the cowboy and the Easterner, and at the end of this scornful
sentence he left the room.
</p><p>Upstairs the Swede was swiftly fastening the straps of his
great valise.  Once his back happened to be half-turned toward the
door, and hearing a noise there, he wheeled and sprang up, uttering
a loud cry.  Scully's wrinkled visage showed grimly in the light of
the small lamp he carried.  This yellow effulgence, streaming
upward, colored only his prominent features, and left his eyes, for
instance, in mysterious shadow.  He resembled a murderer.
</p><p>"Man, man!" he exclaimed, "have you gone daffy?"
</p><p>"Oh, no!  Oh, no!" rejoined the other.  "There are people in
this world who know pretty nearly as much as you do&mdash;understand?"
</p><p>For a moment they stood gazing at each other.  Upon the
Swede's deathly pale cheeks were two spots brightly crimson and
sharply edged, as if they had been carefully painted.  Scully
placed the light on the table and sat himself on the edge of the
bed.  He spoke ruminatively.  "By cracky, I never heard of such a
thing in my life.  It's a complete muddle.  I can't for the soul of
me think how you ever got this idea into your head."  Presently he
lifted his eyes and asked: "And did you sure think they were going
to kill you?"
</p><p>The Swede scanned the old man as if he wished to see into his
mind.  "I did," he said at last.  He obviously suspected that this
answer might precipitate an outbreak.  As he pulled on a strap his
whole arm shook, the elbow wavering like a bit of paper.
</p><p>Scully banged his hand impressively on the foot-board of the
bed.  "Why, man, we're goin' to have a line of ilictric street-cars
in this town next spring."
</p><p>"'A line of electric street-cars,'" repeated the Swede
stupidly.
</p><p>"And," said Scully, "there's a new railroad goin' to be built
down from Broken Arm to here.  Not to mintion the four churches and
the smashin' big brick school-house.  Then there's the big factory,
too.  Why, in two years Romper'll be a met-tro-<hi rend="italic">pol</hi>-is."
</p><p>Having finished the preparation of his baggage, the Swede
straightened himself.  "Mr. Scully," he said with sudden hardihood,
"how much do I owe you?"
</p><p>"You don't owe me anythin'," said the old man angrily.
</p><p>"Yes, I do," retorted the Swede.  He took seventy-five cents
from his pocket and tendered it to Scully; but the latter snapped
his fingers in disdainful refusal.  However, it happened that they
both stood gazing in a strange fashion at three silver pieces on
the Swede's open palm.
</p><p>"I'll not take your money," said Scully at last.  "Not after
what's been goin' on here."  Then a plan seemed to strike him.
"Here," he cried, picking up his lamp and moving toward the door.
"Here!  Come with me a minute."
</p><p>"No," said the Swede in overwhelming alarm.
</p><p>"Yes," urged the old man.  "Come on!  I want you to come and
see a picter&mdash;just across the hall&mdash;in my room."
</p><p>The Swede must have concluded that his hour was come.  His jaw
dropped and his teeth showed like a dead man's.  He ultimately
followed Scully across the corridor, but he had the step of one
hung in chains.
</p><p>Scully flashed the light high on the wall of his own chamber.
There was revealed a ridiculous photograph of a little girl.  She
was leaning against a balustrade of gorgeous decoration, and the
formidable bang to her hair was prominent.  The figure was as
graceful as an upright sled-stake, and, withal, it was of the hue
of lead.  "There," said Scully tenderly.  "That's the picter of my
little girl that died.  Her name was Carrie.  She had the purtiest
hair you ever saw!  I was that fond of her, she&mdash;"
</p><p>Turning then he saw that the Swede was not contemplating the
picture at all, but, instead, was keeping keen watch on the gloom
in the rear.
</p><p>"Look, man!" shouted Scully heartily.  "That's the picter of
my little gal that died.  Her name was Carrie.  And then here's the
picter of my oldest boy, Michael.  He's a lawyer in Lincoln an'
doin' well.  I gave that boy a grand eddycation, and I'm glad for
it now.  He's a fine boy.  Look at 'im now.  Ain't he bold as
blazes, him there in Lincoln, an honored an' respicted gintleman.
An honored an' respicted gintleman," concluded Scully with a
flourish.  And so saying, he smote the Swede jovially on the back.
</p><p>The Swede faintly smiled.
</p><p>"Now," said the old man, "there's only one more thing."  He
dropped suddenly to the floor and thrust his head beneath the bed.
The Swede could hear his muffled voice.  "I'd keep it under me
piller if it wasn't for that boy Johnnie.  Then there's the old
woman&mdash;  Where is it now?  I never put it twice in the same place.
Ah, now come out with you!"
</p><p>Presently he backed clumsily from under the bed, dragging with
him an old coat rolled into a bundle.  "I've fetched him," he
muttered.  Kneeling on the floor he unrolled the coat and extracted
from its heart a large yellow-brown whisky bottle.
</p><p>His first maneuver was to hold the bottle up to the light.
Reassured, apparently, that nobody had been tampering with it, he
thrust it with a generous movement toward the Swede.
</p><p>The weak-kneed Swede was about to eagerly clutch this element
of strength, but he suddenly jerked his hand away and cast a look
of horror upon Scully.
</p><p>"Drink," said the old man affectionately.  He had arisen to
his feet, and now stood facing the Swede.
</p><p>There was a silence.  Then again Scully said: "Drink!"
</p><p>The Swede laughed wildly.  He grabbed the bottle, put it to
his mouth, and as his lips curled absurdly around the opening and
his throat worked, he kept his glance burning with hatred upon the
old man's face.</p>

<p>AFTER the departure of Scully the three men, with the card-board still upon their knees, preserved for a long time an
astounded silence.  Then Johnnie said: "That's the dod-dangest
Swede I ever see."
</p><p>"He ain't no Swede," said the cowboy scornfully.
</p><p>"Well, what is he then?" cried Johnnie.  "What is he then?"
</p><p>"It's my opinion," replied the cowboy deliberately, "he's some
kind of a Dutchman."  It was a venerable custom of the country to
entitle as Swedes all light-haired men who spoke with a heavy
tongue.  In consequence the idea of the cowboy was not without its
daring.  "Yes, sir," he repeated.  "It's my opinion this feller is
some kind of a Dutchman." <pb n="16"/>
</p><p>"Well, he says he's a Swede, anyhow," muttered Johnnie
sulkily.  He turned to the Easterner.  "What do you think, Mr.
Blanc?"
</p><p>"Oh, I don't know," replied the Easterner.
</p><p>"Well, what do you think makes him act that way?" asked the
cowboy.
</p><p>"Why, he's frightened!"  The Easterner knocked his pipe
against a rim of the stove.  "He's clear frightened out of his
boots."
</p><p>"What at?" cried Johnnie and cowboy together.
</p><p>The Easterner reflected over his answer.
</p><p>"What at?" cried the others again.
</p><p>"Oh, I don't know, but it seems to me this man has been
reading dime-novels, and he thinks he's right out in the middle of
it&mdash;the shootin' and stabbin' and all."
</p><p>"But," said the cowboy, deeply scandalized, "this ain't
Wyoming, ner none of them places.  This is Nebrasker."
</p><p>"Yes," added Johnnie, "an' why don't he wait till he gits
<hi rend="italic">out West?"</hi>
</p><p>The traveled Easterner laughed.  "It isn't different there
even&mdash;not in these days.  But he thinks he's right in the middle of
hell."
</p><p>Johnnie and the cowboy mused long.
</p><p>"It's awful funny," remarked Johnnie at last.
</p><p>"Yes," said the cowboy.  "This is a queer game.  I hope we
don't git snowed in, because then we'd have to stand this here man
bein' around with us all the time.  That wouldn't be no good."
</p><p>"I wish pop would throw him out," said Johnnie.
</p><p>Presently they heard a loud stamping on the stairs,
accompanied by ringing jokes in the voice of old Scully, and
laughter, evidently from the Swede.  The men around the stove
stared vacantly at each other.  "Gosh," said the cowboy.  The door
flew open, and old Scully, flushed and anecdotal, came into the
room.  He was jabbering at the Swede, who followed him, laughing
bravely.  It was the entry of two roysterers from a banquet hall.
</p><p>"Come now," said Scully sharply to the three seated men, "move
up and give us a chance at the stove."  The cowboy and the
Easterner obediently sidled their chairs to make room for the
newcomers.  Johnnie, however, simply arranged himself in a more
indolent attitude, and then remained motionless.
</p><p>"Come!  Git over, there," said Scully.
</p><p>"Plenty of room on the other side of the stove," said Johnnie.
</p><p>"Do you think we want to sit in the draught?" roared the
father.
</p><p>But the Swede here interposed with a grandeur of confidence.
"No, no.  Let the boy sit where he likes," he cried in a bullying
voice to the father.
</p><p>"All right!  All right!" said Scully deferentially.  The
cowboy and the Easterner exchanged glances of wonder.
</p><p>The five chairs were formed in a crescent about one side of
the stove.  The Swede began to talk; he talked arrogantly,
profanely, angrily.  Johnnie, the cowboy and the Easterner
maintained a morose silence, while old Scully appeared to be
receptive and eager, breaking in constantly with sympathetic
ejaculations.
</p><p>Finally the Swede announced that he was thirsty.  He moved in
his chair, and said that he would go for a drink of water.
</p><p>"I'll git it for you," cried Scully at once.
</p><p>"No," said the Swede contemptuously.  "I'll get it for
myself."  He arose and stalked with the air of an owner off into
the executive parts of the hotel.
</p><p>As soon as the Swede was out of hearing Scully sprang to his
feet and whispered intensely to the others.  "Upstairs he thought
I was tryin' to poison 'im."
</p><p>"Say," said Johnnie, "this makes me sick.  Why don't you throw
'im out in the snow?"
</p><p>"Why, he's all right now," declared Scully.  "It was only that
he was from the East and he thought this was a tough place.  That's
all.  He's all right now."
</p><p>The cowboy looked with admiration upon the Easterner.  "You
were straight," he said.  "You were on to that there Dutchman."
</p><p>"Well," said Johnnie to his father, "he may be all right now,
but I don't see it.  Other time he was scared, and now he's too
fresh."
</p><p>Scully's speech was always a combination of Irish brogue and
idiom, Western twang and idiom, and scraps of curiously formal
diction taken from the story-books and newspapers.  He now hurled
a strange mass of language at the head of his son.  "What do I
keep?  What do I keep?  What do I keep?" he demanded in a voice of
thunder.  He slapped his knee impressively, to indicate that he
himself was going to make reply, and that all should heed.  "I keep
a hotel," he shouted.  "A hotel, do you mind?  A guest under my
roof has sacred privileges.  He is to be intimidated by none.  Not
one word shall he hear that would prijudice him in favor of goin'
away.  I'll not have it.  There's no place in this here town where
they can say they iver took in a guest of mine because he was
afraid to stay here."  He wheeled suddenly upon the cowboy and the
Easterner.  "Am I right?"
</p><p>"Yes, Mr. Scully," said the cowboy, "I think you're right."
</p><p>"Yes, Mr. Scully," said the Easterner, "I think you're
right."</p>
</div2>

<div2 type="section" n="5.1" id="d8">
<head>V</head>

<p>AT six-o'clock supper, the Swede fizzed like a fire-wheel.  He
sometimes seemed on the point of bursting into riotous song, and in
all his madness he was encouraged by old Scully.  The Easterner was
incased in reserve; the cowboy sat in wide-mouthed amazement,
forgetting to eat, while Johnnie wrathily demolished great plates
of food.  The daughters of the house when they were obliged to
replenish the biscuits approached as warily as Indians, and, having
succeeded in their purposes, fled with ill-concealed trepidation.
The Swede domineered the whole feast, and he gave it the appearance
of a cruel bacchanal.  He seemed to have grown suddenly taller; he
gazed, brutally disdainful, into every face.  His voice rang
through the room.  Once when he jabbed out harpoon-fashion with his
fork to pinion a biscuit the weapon nearly impaled the hand of the
Easterner which had been stretched quietly out for the same
biscuit.
</p><p>After supper, as the men filed toward the other room, the
Swede smote Scully ruthlessly on the shoulder.  "Well, old boy,
that was a good square meal."  Johnnie looked hopefully at his
father; he knew that shoulder was tender from an old fall; and
indeed it appeared for a moment as if Scully was going to flame out
over the matter, but in the end he smiled a sickly smile and
remained silent.  The others understood from his manner that he was
admitting his responsibility for the Swede's new viewpoint.
</p><p>Johnnie, however, addressed his parent in an aside.  "Why
don't you license somebody to kick you downstairs?"  Scully scowled
darkly by way of reply.
</p><p>When they were gathered about the stove, the Swede insisted on
another game of High-Five.  Scully gently deprecated the plan at
first, but the Swede turned a wolfish glare upon him.  The old man
subsided, and the Swede canvassed the others.  In his tone there
was always a great threat.  The cowboy and the Easterner both
remarked indifferently that they would play.  Scully said that he
would presently have to go to meet the 6.58 train, and so the Swede
turned menacingly upon Johnnie.  For a moment their glances crossed
like blades, and then Johnnie smiled and said: "Yes, I'll play."
</p><p>They formed a square with the little board on their knees.
The Easterner and the Swede were again partners.  As the play went
on, it was noticeable that the cowboy was not board-whacking as
usual.  Meanwhile, Scully, near the lamp, had put on his spectacles
and, with an appearance curiously like an old priest, was reading
a newspaper.  In time he went out to meet the 6.58 train, and,
despite his precautions, a gust of polar wind whirled into the room
as he opened the door.  Besides scattering the cards, it chilled
the players to the marrow.  The Swede cursed frightfully.  When
Scully returned, his entrance disturbed a cozy and friendly scene.
The Swede again cursed.  But presently they were once more intent,
their heads bent forward and their hands moving swiftly.  The Swede
had adopted the fashion of board-whacking.
</p><p>Scully took up his paper and for a long time remained immersed
in matters which were extraordinarily remote from him.  The lamp
burned badly, and once he stopped to adjust the wick.  The
newspaper as he turned from page to page rustled with a slow and
comfortable sound.  Then suddenly he heard three terrible words:
"You are cheatin'!"
</p><p>Such scenes often prove that there can be little of dramatic
import in environment.  Any room can present a tragic front; any
room can be comic.  This little den was now hideous as a torture-chamber.  The new faces of the men themselves had changed it upon
the instant.  The Swede held a huge fist in front of Johnnie's
face, while the latter looked steadily over it into the blazing
orbs of his accuser.  The Easterner had grown pallid; the cowboy's
jaw had dropped in that expression of bovine amazement which was
one of his important mannerisms.  After the three words, the first
sound in the room was made by Scully's paper as it floated
forgotten to his feet.  His spectacles had also fallen from his
nose, but by a clutch he had saved them in air.  His hand, grasping
the spectacles, now remained poised awkwardly and near his
shoulder.  He stared at the card-players.

<div2 type="section" n="5.2" id="d10">
<head>(Continued from Last Week&mdash; Chapter V.) </head>

<p>PROBABLY the silence was while a second elapsed.  Then, if the
floor had been suddenly twitched out from under the men they could
not have moved quicker.  The five had projected themselves headlong
toward a common point.  It happened that Johnnie in rising to hurl
himself upon the Swede had stumbled slightly because of his
curiously instinctive care for the cards and the board.  The loss
of the moment allowed time for the arrival of Scully, and also
allowed the cowboy time to give the Swede a great push which sent
him staggering back.  The men found tongue together, and hoarse
shouts of rage, appeal or fear burst from every throat.  The cowboy
pushed and jostled feverishly at the Swede, and the Easterner and
Scully clung wildly to Johnnie; but, through the smoky air, above
the swaying bodies of the peace-compellers, the eyes of the two
warriors ever sought each other in glances of challenge that were
at once hot and steely.
</p><p>Of course the board had been overturned, and now the whole
company of cards was scattered over the floor, where the boots of
the men trampled the fat and painted kings and queens as they gazed
with their silly eyes at the war that was waging above them.
</p><p>Scully's voice was dominating the yells.  "Stop now!  Stop, I
say!  Stop, now&mdash;"
</p><p>Johnnie, as he struggled to burst through the rank formed by
Scully and the Easterner, was crying: "Well, he says I cheated!  He
says I cheated!  I won't allow no man to say I cheated!  If he says
I cheated, he's a &mdash; &mdash;!"
</p><p>The cowboy was telling the Swede: "Quit, now!  Quit, d'ye
hear&mdash;"
</p><p>The screams of the Swede never ceased.  "He did cheat!  I saw
him!  I saw him&mdash;"
</p><p>As for the Easterner, he was importuning in a voice that was
not heeded.  "Wait a moment, can't you?  Oh, wait a moment.  What's
the good of a fight over a game of cards?  Wait a moment&mdash;"
</p><p>In this tumult no complete sentences were clear.  "Cheat"&mdash;
"Quit"&mdash;"He says"&mdash;  These fragments pierced the uproar and rang
out sharply.  It was remarkable that whereas Scully undoubtedly
made the most noise, he was the least heard of any of the riotous
band.
</p><p>Then suddenly there was a great cessation.  It was as if each
man had paused for breath, and although the room was still lighted
with the anger of men, it could be seen that there was no danger of
immediate conflict, and at once Johnnie, shouldering his way
forward, almost succeeded in confronting the Swede.  "What did you
say I cheated for?  What did you say I cheated for?  I don't cheat
and I won't let no man say I do!"
</p><p>The Swede said: "I saw you!  I saw you!"
</p><p>"Well," cried Johnnie, "I'll fight any man what says I cheat!"
</p><p>"No, you won't," said the cowboy.  "Not here."
</p><p>"Ah, be still, can't you?" said Scully, coming between them.
</p><p>The quiet was sufficient to allow the Easterner's voice to be
heard.  He was repeating: "Oh, wait a moment, can't you?  What's
the good of a fight over a game of cards?  Wait a moment."
</p><p>Johnnie, his red face appearing above his father's shoulder,
hailed the Swede again.  "Did you say I cheated?"
</p><p>The Swede showed his teeth.  "Yes."
</p><p>"Then," said Johnnie, "we must fight."
</p><p>"Yes, fight," roared the Swede.  He was like a demoniac.
"Yes, fight!  I'll show you what kind of a man I am!  I'll show you
who you want to fight!  Maybe you think I can't fight!  Maybe you
think I can't!  I'll show you, you skin, you card-sharp!  Yes, you
cheated!  You cheated!  You cheated!"
</p><p>"Well, let's git at it, then, mister," said Johnnie coolly.
</p><p>The cowboy's brow was beaded with sweat from his efforts in
intercepting all sorts of raids.  He turned in despair to Scully.
"What are you goin' to do now?"
</p><p>A change had come over the Celtic visage of the old man.  He
now seemed all eagerness; his eyes glowed.
</p><p>"We'll let them fight," he answered stalwartly.  "I can't put
up with it any longer.  I've stood this damned Swede till I'm sick.
We'll let them fight."</p>

<div2 type="section" n="6" id="d11">
<head>VI</head>

<p>THE men prepared to go out of doors.  The Easterner was so
nervous that he had great difficulty in getting his arms into the
sleeves of his new leather-coat.  As the cowboy drew his fur-cap
down over his ears his hands trembled.  In fact, Johnnie and old
Scully were the only ones who displayed no agitation.  These
preliminaries were conducted without words.
</p><p>Scully threw open the door.  "Well, come on," he said.
Instantly a terrific wind caused the flame of the lamp to struggle
at its wick, while a puff of black smoke sprang from the chimney-top.  The stove was in mid-current of the blast, and its voice
swelled to equal the roar of the storm.  Some of the scarred and
bedabbled cards were caught up from the floor and dashed helplessly
against the further wall.  The men lowered their heads and plunged
into the tempest as into a sea.
</p><p>No snow was falling, but great whirls and clouds of flakes,
swept up from the ground by the frantic winds, were streaming
southward with the speed of bullets.  The covered land was blue
with the sheen of an unearthly satin, and there was no other hue
save where at the low black railway station&mdash;which seemed
incredibly distant&mdash;one light gleamed like a tiny jewel.  As the
men floundered into a thigh-deep drift, it was known that the Swede
was bawling out something.  Scully went to him, put a hand on his
shoulder and projected an ear.  "What's that you say?" he shouted.
</p><p>"I say," bawled the Swede again, "I won't stand much show
against this gang.  I know you'll all pitch on me."
</p><p>Scully smote him reproachfully on the arm.  "Tut, man," he
yelled.  The wind tore the words from Scully's lips and scattered
them far a-lee.
</p><p>"You are all a gang of&mdash;" boomed the Swede, but the storm also
seized the remainder of this sentence.
</p><p>Immediately turning their backs upon the wind, the men had
swung around a corner to the sheltered side of the hotel.  It was
the function of the little house to preserve here, amid this great
devastation of snow, an irregular V-shape of heavily-incrusted
grass, which crackled beneath the feet.  One could imagine the
great drifts piled against the windward side.  When the party
reached the comparative peace of this spot it was found that the
Swede was still bellowing.
</p><p>"Oh, I know what kind of a thing this is!  I know you'll all
pitch on me.  I can't lick you all!"
</p><p>Scully turned upon him panther-fashion.  "You'll not have to
whip all of us.  You'll have to whip my son Johnnie.  An' the man
what troubles you durin' that time will have me to dale with."
</p><p>The arrangements were swiftly made.  The two men faced each
other, obedient to the harsh commands of Scully, whose face, in the
subtly luminous gloom, could be seen set in the austere impersonal
lines that are pictured on the countenances of the Roman veterans.
The Easterner's teeth were chattering, and he was hopping up and
down like a mechanical toy.  The cowboy stood rock-like.
</p><p>The contestants had not stripped off any clothing.  Each was
in his ordinary attire.  Their fists were up, and they eyed each
other in a calm that had the elements of leonine cruelty in it.
</p><p>During this pause, the Easterner's mind, like a film, took
lasting impressions of three men&mdash;the iron-nerved master of the
ceremony; the Swede, pale, motionless, terrible; and Johnnie,
serene yet ferocious, brutish yet heroic.  The entire prelude had
in it a tragedy greater than the tragedy of action, and this aspect
was accentuated by the long mellow cry of the blizzard, as it sped
the tumbling and wailing flakes into the black abyss of the south.
</p><p>"Now!" said Scully.
</p><p>The two combatants leaped forward and crashed together like
bullocks.  There was heard the cushioned sound of blows, and of a
curse squeezing out from between the tight teeth of one.
</p><p>As for the spectators, the Easterner's pent-up breath exploded
from him with a pop of relief, absolute relief from the tension of
the preliminaries.  The cowboy bounded into the air with a yowl.
Scully was immovable as from supreme amazement and fear at the fury
of the fight which he himself had permitted and arranged.
</p><p>For a time the encounter in the darkness was such a perplexity
of flying arms that it presented no more detail than would a
swiftly-revolving wheel.  Occasionally a face, as if illumined by
a flash of light, would shine out, ghastly and marked with pink
spots.  A moment later, the men might have been known as shadows,
if it were not for the involuntary utterance of oaths that came
from them in whispers.
</p><p>Suddenly a holocaust of warlike desire caught the cowboy, and
he bolted forward with the speed of a broncho.  "Go it, Johnnie; go
it!  Kill him!  Kill him!"
</p><p>Scully confronted him.  "Kape back," he said; and by his
glance the cowboy could tell that this man was Johnnie's father.
</p><p>To the Easterner there was a monotony of unchangeable fighting
that was an abomination.  This confused mingling was eternal to his
sense, which was concentrated in a longing for the end, the
priceless end.  Once the fighters lurched near him, and as he
scrambled hastily backward, he heard them breathe like men on the
rack.
</p><p>"Kill him, Johnnie!  Kill him!  Kill him!  Kill him!"  The
cowboy's face was contorted like one of those agony masks in
museums.
</p><p>"Keep still," said Scully icily.
</p><p>Then there was a sudden loud grunt, incomplete, cut short, and
Johnnie's body swung away from the Swede and fell with sickening
heaviness to the grass.  The cowboy was barely in time to prevent
the mad Swede from flinging himself upon his prone adversary.  "No,
you don't," said the cowboy, interposing an arm.  "Wait a second."
</p><p>Scully was at his son's side.  "Johnnie!  Johnnie, me boy?"
His voice had a quality of melancholy tenderness.  "Johnnie?  Can
you go on with it?"  He looked anxiously down into the bloody pulpy
face of his son.
</p><p>There was a moment of silence, and then Johnnie answered in
his ordinary voice: "Yes, I&mdash;it&mdash;yes."
</p><p>Assisted by his father he struggled to his feet.  "Wait a bit
now till you git your wind," said the old man.
</p><p>A few paces away the cowboy was lecturing the Swede.  "No, you
don't!  Wait a second!"
</p><p>The Easterner was plucking at Scully's sleeve.  "Oh, this is
enough," he pleaded.  "This is enough!  Let it go as it stands.
This is enough!"
</p><p>"Bill," said Scully, "git out of the road."  The cowboy
stepped aside.  "Now."  The combatants were actuated by a new
caution as they advanced toward collision.  They glared at each
other, and then the Swede aimed a lightning blow that carried with
it his entire weight.  Johnnie was evidently half-stupid from
weakness, but he miraculously dodged, and his fist sent the over-balanced Swede sprawling.
</p><p>The cowboy, Scully and the Easterner burst into a cheer that
was like a chorus of triumphant soldiery, but before its conclusion
the Swede had scuffled agilely to his feet and come in berserk
abandon at his foe.  There was another perplexity of flying arms,
and Johnnie's body again swung away and fell, even as a bundle
might fall from a roof.  The Swede instantly staggered to a little
wind-waved tree and leaned upon it, breathing like an engine, while
his savage and flame-lit eyes roamed from face to face as the men
bent over Johnnie.  There was a splendor of isolation in his
situation at this time which the Easterner felt once when, lifting
his eyes from the man on the ground, he beheld that mysterious and
lonely figure, waiting.
</p><p>"Are you any good yet, Johnnie?" asked Scully in a broken
voice.
</p><p>The son gasped and opened his eyes languidly.  After a moment
he answered: "No&mdash;I ain't&mdash;any good&mdash;any&mdash;more."  Then, from shame
and bodily ill, he began to weep, the tears furrowing down through
the bloodstains on his face.  "He was too&mdash;too&mdash;too heavy for me."
</p><p>Scully straightened and addressed the waiting figure.
"Stranger," he said, evenly, "it's all up with our side."  Then his
voice changed into that vibrant huskiness which is commonly the
tone of the most simple and deadly announcements.  "Johnnie is
whipped." <pb n="15"/>
</p><p>Without replying, the victor moved off on the route to the
front door of the hotel.
</p><p>The cowboy was formulating new and unspellable blasphemies.
The Easterner was startled to find that they were out in a wind
that seemed to come direct from the shadowed arctic floes.  He
heard again the wail of the snow as it was flung to its grave in
the south.  He knew now that all this time the cold had been
sinking into him deeper and deeper, and he wondered that he had not
perished.  He felt indifferent to the condition of the vanquished
man.
</p><p>"Johnnie, can you walk?" asked Scully.
</p><p>"Did I hurt&mdash;hurt him any?" asked the son.
</p><p>"Can you walk, boy?  Can you walk?"
</p><p>Johnnie's voice was suddenly strong.  There was a robust
impatience in it.  "I asked you whether I hurt him any!"
</p><p>"Yes, yes, Johnnie," answered the cowboy consolingly; "he's
hurt a good deal."
</p><p>They raised him from the ground, and as soon as he was on his
feet he went tottering off, rebuffing all attempts at assistance.
When the party rounded the corner they were fairly blinded by the
pelting of the snow.  It burned their faces like fire.  The cowboy
carried Johnnie through the drift to the door.  As they entered
some cards again rose from the floor and beat against the wall.
</p><p>The Easterner rushed to the stove.  He was so profoundly
chilled that he almost dared to embrace the glowing iron.  The
Swede was not in the room.  Johnnie sank into a chair, and folding
his arms on his knees, buried his face in them.  Scully, warming
one foot and then the other at a rim of the stove, muttered to
himself with Celtic mournfulness.  The cowboy had removed his fur-cap, and with a dazed and rueful air he was now running one hand
through his tousled locks.  From overhead they could hear the
creaking of boards, as the Swede tramped here and there in his
room.
</p><p>The sad quiet was broken by the sudden flinging open of a door
that led toward the kitchen.  It was instantly followed by an
inrush of women.  They precipitated themselves upon Johnnie amid a
chorus of lamentation.  Before they carried their prey off to the
kitchen, there to be bathed and harangued with that mixture of
sympathy and abuse which is a feat of their sex, the mother
straightened herself and fixed old Scully with an eye of stern
reproach.  "Shame be upon you, Patrick Scully!" she cried.  "Your
own son, too.  Shame be upon you!"
</p><p>"There, now!  Be quiet, now!" said the old man weakly.
</p><p>"Shame be upon you, Patrick Scully!"  The girls rallying to
this slogan, sniffed disdainfully in the direction of those
trembling accomplices, the cowboy and the Easterner.  Presently
they bore Johnnie away, and left the three men to dismal
reflection.</p>

<div2 type="section" n="7" id="d12">

<p>"I'D like to fight this here Dutchman myself," said the
cowboy, breaking a long silence.
</p><p>Scully wagged his head sadly.  "No, that wouldn't do.  It
wouldn't be right.  It wouldn't be right."
</p><p>"Well, why wouldn't it?" argued the cowboy.  "I don't see no
harm in it."
</p><p>"No," answered Scully with mournful heroism.  "It wouldn't be
right.  It was Johnnie's fight, and now we mustn't whip the man
just because he whipped Johnnie."
</p><p>"Yes, that's true enough," said the cowboy; "but&mdash;he better
not get fresh with me, because I couldn't stand no more of it."
</p><p>"You'll not say a word to him," commanded Scully, and even
then they heard the tread of the Swede on the stairs.  His entrance
was made theatric.  He swept the door back with a bang and
swaggered to the middle of the room.  No one looked at him.
"Well," he cried, insolently, at Scully, "I s'pose you'll tell me
now how much I owe you?"
</p><p>The old man remained stolid.  "You don't owe me nothin'."
</p><p>"Huh!" said the Swede, "huh!  Don't owe 'im nothin'."
</p><p>The cowboy addressed the Swede.  "Stranger, I don't see how
you come to be so gay around here."
</p><p>Old Scully was instantly alert.  "Stop!" he shouted, holding
his hand forth, fingers upward.  "Bill, you shut up!"
</p><p>The cowboy spat carelessly into the sawdust box.  "I didn't
say a word, did I?" he asked.
</p><p>"Mr. Scully," called the Swede, "how much do I owe you?"  It
was seen that he was attired for departure, and that he had his
valise in his hand.
</p><p>"You don't owe me nothin'," repeated Scully in his same
imperturbable way.
</p><p>"Huh!" said the Swede.  "I guess you're right.  I guess if it
was any way at all, you'd owe me somethin'.  That's what I guess."
He turned to the cowboy.  "'Kill him!  Kill him!  Kill him!'" he
mimicked, and then guffawed victoriously.  "Kill him!"  He was
convulsed with ironical humor.
</p><p>But he might have been jeering the dead.  The three men were
immovable and silent, staring with glassy eyes at the stove.
</p><p>The Swede opened the door and passed into the storm, giving
one derisive glance backward at the still group.
</p><p>As soon as the door was closed, Scully and the cowboy leaped
to their feet and began to curse.  They trampled to and fro, waving
their arms and smashing into the air with their fists.  "Oh, but
that was a hard minute!" wailed Scully.  "That was a hard minute!
Him there leerin' and scoffin'!  One bang at his nose was worth
forty dollars to me that minute!  How did you stand it, Bill?"
</p><p>"How did I stand it?" cried the cowboy in a quivering voice.
"How did I stand it?  Oh!"
</p><p>The old man burst into sudden brogue.  "I'd loike to take that
Swade," he wailed, "and hould 'im down on a shtone flure and bate
'im to a jelly wid a shtick!"
</p><p>The cowboy groaned in sympathy.  "I'd like to git him by the
neck and ha-ammer him"&mdash;he brought his hand down on a chair with a
noise like a pistol-shot&mdash;"hammer that there Dutchman until he
couldn't tell himself from a dead coyote!"
</p><p>"I'd bate 'im until he&mdash;"
</p><p>"I'd show <hi rend="italic">him</hi> some things&mdash;"
</p><p>And then together they raised a yearning fanatic cry.  "Oh-o-oh! if we only could&mdash;"
</p><p>"Yes!"
</p><p>"Yes!"
</p><p>"And then I'd&mdash;"
</p><p>"O-o-oh!"</p>

<p>THE Swede, tightly gripping his valise, tacked across the face
of the storm as if he carried sails.  He was following a line of
little naked gasping trees, which he knew must mark the way of the
road.  His face, fresh from the pounding of Johnnie's fists, felt
more pleasure than pain in the wind and the driving snow.  A number
of square shapes loomed upon him finally, and he knew them as the
houses of the main body of the town.  He found a street and made
travel along it, leaning heavily upon the wind whenever, at a
corner, a terrific blast caught him.
</p><p>He might have been in a deserted village.  We picture the
world as thick with conquering and elate humanity, but here, with
the bugles of the tempest pealing, it was hard to imagine a peopled
earth.  One viewed the existence of man then as a marvel, and
conceded a glamour of wonder to these lice which were caused to
cling to a whirling, fire-smote, ice-locked, disease-stricken,
space-lost bulb.  The conceit of man was explained by this storm to
be the very engine of life.  One was a coxcomb not to die in it.
However, the Swede found a saloon.
</p><p>In front of it an indomitable red light was burning, and the
snow-flakes were made blood-color as they flew through the
circumscribed territory of the lamp's shining.  The Swede pushed
open the door of the saloon and entered.  A sanded expanse was
before him, and at the end of it four men sat about a table
drinking.  Down one side of the room extended a radiant bar, and
its guardian was leaning upon his elbows listening to the talk of
the men at the table.  The Swede dropped his valise upon the floor,
and, smiling fraternally upon the barkeeper, said: "Gimme some
whisky, will you?"  The man placed a bottle, a whisky-glass, and
glass of ice-thick water upon the bar.  The Swede poured himself an
abnormal portion of whisky and drank it in three gulps.  "Pretty
bad night," remarked the bartender indifferently.  He was making
the pretension of blindness, which is usually a distinction of his
class; but it could have been seen that he was furtively studying
the half-erased blood-stains on the face of the Swede.  "Bad
night," he said again.
</p><p>"Oh, it's good enough for me," replied the Swede, hardily, as
he poured himself some more whisky.  The barkeeper took his coin
and maneuvered it through its reception by the highly-nickeled
cash-machine.  A bell rang; a card labeled "20 cts." had appeared.
</p><p>"No," continued the Swede, "this isn't too bad weather.  It's
good enough for me."
</p><p>"So?" murmured the barkeeper languidly.
</p><p>The copious drams made the Swede's eyes swim, and he breathed
a trifle heavier.  "Yes, I like this weather.  I like it.  It suits
me."  It was apparently his design to impart a deep significance to
these words. <pb n="16"/>
</p><p>"So?" murmured the bartender again.  He turned to gaze
dreamily at the scroll-like birds and bird-like scrolls which had
been drawn with soap upon the mirrors back of the bar.
</p><p>"Well, I guess I'll take another drink," said the Swede
presently.  "Have something?"
</p><p>"No, thanks; I'm not drinkin'," answered the bartender.
Afterward he asked: "How did you hurt your face?"
</p><p>The Swede immediately began to boast loudly.  "Why, in a
fight.  I thumped the soul out of a man down here at Scully's
hotel."
</p><p>The interest of the four men at the table was at last aroused.
</p><p>"Who was it?" said one.
</p><p>"Johnnie Scully," blustered the Swede.  "Son of the man what
runs it.  He will be pretty near dead for some weeks, I can tell
you.  I made a nice thing of him, I did.  He couldn't get up.  They
carried him in the house.  Have a drink?"
</p><p>Instantly the men in some subtle way incased themselves in
reserve.  "No, thanks," said one.  The group was of curious
formation.  Two were prominent local business men; one was the
district-attorney; and one was a professional gambler of the kind
known as "square."  But a scrutiny of the group would not have
enabled an observer to pick the gambler from the men of more
reputable pursuits.  He was, in fact, a man so delicate in manner,
when among people of fair class, and so judicious in his choice of
victims, that in the strictly masculine part of the town's life he
had come to be explicitly trusted and admired.  People called him
a thoroughbred.  The fear and contempt with which his craft was
regarded was undoubtedly the reason that his quiet dignity shone
conspicuous above the quiet dignity of men who might be merely
hatters, billiard markers or grocery clerks.  Beyond an occasional
unwary traveler, who came by rail, this gambler was supposed to
prey solely upon reckless and senile farmers, who, when flush with
good crops, drove into town in all the pride and confidence of an
absolutely invulnerable stupidity.  Hearing at times in circuitous
fashion of the despoilment of such a farmer, the important men of
Romper invariably laughed in contempt of the victim, and if they
thought of the wolf at all, it was with a kind of pride at the
knowledge that he would never dare think of attacking their wisdom
and courage.  Besides, it was popular that this gambler had a real
wife, and two real children in a neat cottage in a suburb, where he
led an exemplary home life, and when any one even suggested a
discrepancy in his character, the crowd immediately vociferated
descriptions of this virtuous family circle.  Then men who led
exemplary home lives, and men who did not lead exemplary home
lives, all subsided in a bunch, remarking that there was nothing
more to be said.
</p><p>However, when a restriction was placed upon him&mdash;as, for
instance, when a strong clique of members of the new Pollywog Club
refused to permit him, even as a spectator, to appear in the rooms
of the organization&mdash;the candor and gentleness with which he
accepted the judgment disarmed many of his foes and made his
friends more desperately partisan.  He invariably distinguished
between himself and a respectable Romper man so quickly and frankly
that his manner actually appeared to be a continual broadcast
compliment.
</p><p>And one must not forget to declare the fundamental fact of his
entire position in Romper.  It is irrefutable that in all affairs
outside of his business, in all matters that occur eternally and
commonly between man and man, this thieving card-player was so
generous, so just, so moral, that, in a contest, he could have put
to flight the consciences of nine-tenths of the citizens of Romper.
</p><p>And so it happened that he was seated in this saloon with the
two prominent local merchants and the district-attorney.
</p><p>The Swede continued to drink raw whisky, meanwhile babbling at
the barkeeper and trying to induce him to indulge in potations.
"Come on.  Have a drink.  Come on.  What&mdash;no?  Well, have a little
one then.  By gawd, I've whipped a man to-night, and I want to
celebrate.  I whipped him good, too.  Gentlemen," the Swede cried
to the men at the table, "have a drink?"
</p><p>"Ssh!" said the barkeeper.
</p><p>The group at the table, although furtively attentive, had been
pretending to be deep in talk, but now a man lifted his eyes toward
the Swede and said shortly: "Thanks.  We don't want any more."
</p><p>At this reply the Swede ruffled out his chest like a rooster.
"Well," he exploded, "it seems I can't get anybody to drink with me
in this town.  Seems so, don't it?  Well!"
</p><p>"Ssh!" said the barkeeper.
</p><p>"Say," snarled the Swede, "don't you try to shut me up.  I
won't have it.  I'm a gentleman, and I want people to drink with
me.  And I want 'em to drink with me now.  <hi rend="italic">Now</hi>&mdash;do you
understand?"  He rapped the bar with his knuckles.
</p><p>Years of experience had calloused the bartender.  He merely
grew sulky.  "I hear you," he answered.
</p><p>"Well," cried the Swede, "listen hard then.  See those men
over there?  Well, they're going to drink with me, and don't you
forget it.  Now you watch."
</p><p>"Hi!" yelled the barkeeper, "this won't do!"
</p><p>"Why won't it?" demanded the Swede.  He stalked over to the
table, and by chance laid his hand upon the shoulder of the
gambler.  "How about this?" he asked, wrathfully.  "I asked you to
drink with me."
</p><p>The gambler simply twisted his head and spoke over his
shoulder.  "My friend, I don't know you."
</p><p>"Oh, hell!" answered the Swede, "come and have a drink."
</p><p>"Now, my boy," advised the gambler kindly, "take your hand off
my shoulder and go 'way and mind your own business."  He was a
little slim man, and it seemed strange to hear him use this tone of
heroic patronage to the burly Swede.  The other men at the table
said nothing.
</p><p>"What?  You won't drink with me, you little dude!  I'll make
you then!  I'll make you!"  The Swede had grasped the gambler
frenziedly at the throat, and was dragging him from his chair.  The
other men sprang up.  The barkeeper dashed around the corner of his
bar.  There was a great tumult, and then was seen a long blade in
the hand of the gambler.  It shot forward, and a human body, this
citadel of virtue, wisdom, power, was pierced as easily as if it
had been a melon.  The Swede fell with a cry of supreme
astonishment.
</p><p>The prominent merchants and the district-attorney must have at
once tumbled out of the place backward.  The bartender found
himself hanging limply to the arm of a chair and gazing into the
eyes of a murderer.
</p><p>"Henry," said the latter, as he wiped his knife on one of the
towels that hung beneath the bar-rail, "you tell 'em where to find
me.  I'll be home, waiting for 'em."  Then he vanished.  A moment
afterward the barkeeper was in the street dinning through the storm
for help, and, moreover, companionship.
</p><p>The corpse of the Swede, alone in the saloon, had its eyes
fixed upon a dreadful legend that dwelt a-top of the cash-machine.
"This registers the amount of your purchase."</p>

<p>MONTHS later, the cowboy was frying pork over the stove of a
little ranch near the Dakota line, when there was a quick thud of
hoofs outside, and, presently, the Easterner entered with the
letters and the papers.
</p><p>"Well," said the Easterner at once, "the chap that killed the
Swede has got three years.  Wasn't much, was it?"
</p><p>"He has?  Three years?"  The cowboy poised his pan of pork,
while he ruminated upon the news.  "Three years.  That ain't much."
</p><p>"No.  It was a light sentence," replied the Easterner as he
unbuckled his spurs.  "Seems there was a good deal of sympathy for
him in Romper."
</p><p>"If the bartender had been any good," observed the cowboy
thoughtfully, "he would have gone in and cracked that there
Dutchman on the head with a bottle in the beginnin' of it and
stopped all this here murderin'."
</p><p>"Yes, a thousand things might have happened," said the
Easterner tartly.
</p><p>The cowboy returned his pan of pork to the fire, but his
philosophy continued.  "It's funny, ain't it?  If he hadn't said
Johnnie was cheatin' he'd be alive this minute.  He was an awful
fool.  Game played for fun, too.  Not for money.  I believe he was
crazy."
</p><p>"I feel sorry for that gambler," said the Easterner.
</p><p>"Oh, so do I," said the cowboy.  "He don't deserve none of it
for killin' who he did."
</p><p>"The Swede might not have been killed if everything had been
square."
</p><p>"Might not have been killed?" exclaimed the cowboy.
"Everythin' square?  Why, when he said that Johnnie was cheatin'
and acted like such a jackass?  And then in the saloon he fairly
walked up to git hurt?"  With these arguments the cowboy browbeat
the Easterner and reduced him to rage.
</p><p>"You're a fool!" cried the Easterner viciously.  "You're a
bigger jackass than the Swede by a million majority.  Now let me
tell you one thing.  Let me tell you something.  Listen!  Johnnie
<hi rend="italic">was</hi> cheating!"
</p><p>"'Johnnie,'" said the cowboy blankly.  There was a minute of
silence, and then he said robustly: "Why, no.  The game was only
for fun."
</p><p>"Fun or not," said the Easterner, "Johnnie was cheating.  I
saw him.  I know it.  I saw him.  And I refused to stand up and be
a man.  I let the Swede fight it out alone.  And you&mdash;you were
simply puffing around the place and wanting to fight.  And then old
Scully himself!  We are all in it!  This poor gambler isn't even a
noun.  He is kind of an adverb.  Every sin is the result of a
collaboration.  We, five of us, have collaborated in the murder of
this Swede.  Usually there are from a dozen to forty women really
involved in every murder, but in this case it seems to be only five
men&mdash;you, I, Johnnie, old Scully, and that fool of an unfortunate
gambler came merely as a culmination, the apex of a human movement,
and gets all the punishment."
</p><p>The cowboy, injured and rebellious, cried out blindly into
this fog of mysterious theory.  "Well, I didn't do anythin', did I?"</p>
