</p><p><stage>Enter SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I will make a Star-<lb/>
chamber matter of it: if he were twenty Sir John<lb/>
Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>In the county of Gloucester, justice of peace and<lb/>
'Coram.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Ay, cousin Slender, and 'Custalourum.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>Ay, and 'Rato-lorum' too; and a gentleman born,<lb/>
master parson; who writes himself 'Armigero,' in any<lb/>
bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation, 'Armigero.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three<lb/>
hundred years.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>All his successors gone before him hath done't; and<lb/>
all his ancestors that come after him may: they may<lb/>
give the dozen white luces in their coat.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>It is an old coat.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>The dozen white louses do become an old coat well;<lb/>
it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to<lb/>
man, and signifies love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old coat.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>I may quarter, coz.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>You may, by marrying.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Not a whit.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>Yes, py'r lady; if he has a quarter of your coat,<lb/>
there is but three skirts for yourself, in my<lb/>
simple conjectures: but that is all one. If Sir<lb/>
John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto<lb/>
you, I am of the church, and will be glad to do my<lb/>
benevolence to make atonements and compremises<lb/>
between you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>The council shall bear it; it is a riot.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>It is not meet the council hear a riot; there is no<lb/>
fear of Got in a riot: the council, look you, shall<lb/>
desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a<lb/>
riot; take your vizaments in that.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Ha! o' my life, if I were young again, the sword<lb/>
should end it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>It is petter that friends is the sword, and end it:<lb/>
and there is also another device in my prain, which<lb/>
peradventure prings goot discretions with it: there<lb/>
is Anne Page, which is daughter to Master Thomas<lb/>
Page, which is pretty virginity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks<lb/>
small like a woman.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>It is that fery person for all the orld, as just as<lb/>
you will desire; and seven hundred pounds of moneys,<lb/>
and gold and silver, is her grandsire upon his<lb/>
death's-bed&mdash;Got deliver to a joyful resurrections!<lb/>
&mdash;give, when she is able to overtake seventeen years<lb/>
old: it were a goot motion if we leave our pribbles<lb/>
and prabbles, and desire a marriage between Master<lb/>
Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>Ay, and her father is make her a petter penny.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>I know the young gentlewoman; she has good gifts.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>Seven hundred pounds and possibilities is goot gifts.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff there?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I do<lb/>
despise one that is false, or as I despise one that<lb/>
is not true. The knight, Sir John, is there; and, I<lb/>
beseech you, be ruled by your well-willers. I will<lb/>
peat the door for Master Page.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Knocks</stage></p>


<p>
What, hoa! Got pless your house here!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p><stage>[Within]</stage></p><p>  Who's there?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter PAGE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>Here is Got's plessing, and your friend, and Justice<lb/>
Shallow; and here young Master Slender, that<lb/>
peradventures shall tell you another tale, if<lb/>
matters grow to your likings.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>I am glad to see your worships well.<lb/>
I thank you for my venison, Master Shallow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Master Page, I am glad to see you: much good do it<lb/>
your good heart! I wished your venison better; it<lb/>
was ill killed. How doth good Mistress Page?&mdash;and I<lb/>
thank you always with my heart, la! with my heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Sir, I thank you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say he<lb/>
was outrun on Cotsall.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>It could not be judged, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>You'll not confess, you'll not confess.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>That he will not. 'Tis your fault, 'tis your fault;<lb/>
'tis a good dog.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>A cur, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Sir, he's a good dog, and a fair dog: can there be<lb/>
more said? he is good and fair. Is Sir John<lb/>
Falstaff here?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a good<lb/>
office between you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>He hath wronged me, Master Page.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>If it be confessed, it is not redress'd: is not that<lb/>
so, Master Page? He hath wronged me; indeed he<lb/>
hath, at a word, he hath, believe me: Robert<lb/>
Shallow, esquire, saith, he is wronged.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Here comes Sir John.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, NYM, and PISTOL</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Now, Master Shallow, you'll complain of me to the king?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Knight, you have beaten my men, killed my deer, and<lb/>
broke open my lodge.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>But not kissed your keeper's daughter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Tut, a pin! this shall be answered.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>I will answer it straight; I have done all this.<lb/>
That is now answered.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>The council shall know this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel:<lb/>
you'll be laughed at.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Good worts! good cabbage. Slender, I broke your<lb/>
head: what matter have you against me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you;<lb/>
and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph,<lb/>
Nym, and Pistol.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BARDOLPH</speaker>
<p>You Banbury cheese!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>Ay, it is no matter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISTOL</speaker>
<p>How now, Mephostophilus!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>Ay, it is no matter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NYM</speaker>
<p>Slice, I say! pauca, pauca: slice! that's my humour.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>Where's Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There is<lb/>
three umpires in this matter, as I understand; that<lb/>
is, Master Page, fidelicet Master Page; and there is<lb/>
myself, fidelicet myself; and the three party is,<lb/>
lastly and finally, mine host of the Garter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>We three, to hear it and end it between them.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>Fery goot: I will make a prief of it in my note-<lb/>
book; and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with<lb/>
as great discreetly as we can.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Pistol!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISTOL</speaker>
<p>He hears with ears.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>The tevil and his tam! what phrase is this, 'He<lb/>
hears with ear'? why, it is affectations.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I might<lb/>
never come in mine own great chamber again else, of<lb/>
seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward<lb/>
shovel-boards, that cost me two shilling and two<lb/>
pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Is this true, Pistol?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>No; it is false, if it is a pick-purse.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISTOL</speaker>
<p>Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and Master mine,<lb/>
I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.<lb/>
Word of denial in thy labras here!<lb/>
Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>By these gloves, then, 'twas he.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NYM</speaker>
<p>Be avised, sir, and pass good humours: I will say<lb/>
'marry trap' with you, if you run the nuthook's<lb/>
humour on me; that is the very note of it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for<lb/>
though I cannot remember what I did when you made me<lb/>
drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>What say you, Scarlet and John?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BARDOLPH</speaker>
<p>Why, sir, for my part I say the gentleman had drunk<lb/>
himself out of his five sentences.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>It is his five senses: fie, what the ignorance is!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BARDOLPH</speaker>
<p>And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered; and<lb/>
so conclusions passed the careires.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but 'tis no<lb/>
matter: I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again,<lb/>
but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick:<lb/>
if I be drunk, I'll be drunk with those that have<lb/>
the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you hear it.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter ANNE PAGE, with wine; MISTRESS FORD	and MISTRESS PAGE, following</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we'll drink within.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit ANNE PAGE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>How now, Mistress Ford!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met:<lb/>
by your leave, good mistress.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Kisses her</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a<lb/>
hot venison pasty to dinner: come, gentlemen, I hope<lb/>
we shall drink down all unkindness.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all except SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of<lb/>
Songs and Sonnets here.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter SIMPLE</stage></p>


<p>
How now, Simple! where have you been? I must wait<lb/>
on myself, must I? You have not the Book of Riddles<lb/>
about you, have you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMPLE</speaker>
<p>Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it to Alice<lb/>
Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last, a fortnight<lb/>
afore Michaelmas?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word with<lb/>
you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere, a<lb/>
tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh<lb/>
here. Do you understand me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be so,<lb/>
I shall do that that is reason.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Nay, but understand me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>So I do, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>Give ear to his motions, Master Slender: I will<lb/>
description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says: I pray<lb/>
you, pardon me; he's a justice of peace in his<lb/>
country, simple though I stand here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>But that is not the question: the question is<lb/>
concerning your marriage.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Ay, there's the point, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>Marry, is it; the very point of it; to Mistress Anne Page.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any<lb/>
reasonable demands.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>But can you affection the 'oman? Let us command to<lb/>
know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers<lb/>
philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the<lb/>
mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your<lb/>
good will to the maid?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that<lb/>
would do reason.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak<lb/>
possitable, if you can carry her your desires<lb/>
towards her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>I will do a greater thing than that, upon your<lb/>
request, cousin, in any reason.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what I do<lb/>
is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>I will marry her, sir, at your request: but if there<lb/>
be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may<lb/>
decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are<lb/>
married and have more occasion to know one another;<lb/>
I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt:<lb/>
but if you say, 'Marry her,' I will marry her; that<lb/>
I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>It is a fery discretion answer; save the fall is in<lb/>
the ort 'dissolutely:' the ort is, according to our<lb/>
meaning, 'resolutely:' his meaning is good.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Ay, I think my cousin meant well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Here comes fair Mistress Anne.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter ANNE PAGE</stage></p>


<p>
Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANNE PAGE</speaker>
<p>The dinner is on the table; my father desires your<lb/>
worships' company.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>Od's plessed will! I will not be absence at the grace.<lb/>

<p>Will't please your worship to come in, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANNE PAGE</speaker>
<p>The dinner attends you, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. Go,<lb/>

cousin Shallow.<lb/>

<p>
A justice of peace sometimes may be beholding to his<lb/>
friend for a man. I keep but three men and a boy<lb/>
yet, till my mother be dead: but what though? Yet I<lb/>
live like a poor gentleman born.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANNE PAGE</speaker>
<p>I may not go in without your worship: they will not<lb/>
sit till you come.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>I' faith, I'll eat nothing; I thank you as much as<lb/>
though I did.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANNE PAGE</speaker>
<p>I pray you, sir, walk in.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised<lb/>
my shin th' other day with playing at sword and<lb/>
dagger with a master of fence; three veneys for a<lb/>
dish of stewed prunes; and, by my troth, I cannot<lb/>
abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your<lb/>
dogs bark so? be there bears i' the town?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANNE PAGE</speaker>
<p>I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>I love the sport well but I shall as soon quarrel at<lb/>
it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see<lb/>
the bear loose, are you not?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANNE PAGE</speaker>
<p>Ay, indeed, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>That's meat and drink to me, now. I have seen<lb/>
Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by<lb/>
the chain; but, I warrant you, the women have so<lb/>
cried and shrieked at it, that it passed: but women,<lb/>
indeed, cannot abide 'em; they are very ill-favored<lb/>
rough things.<lb/>

<p>By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! come, come.<lb/>

<p>What says my bully-rook? speak scholarly and wisely.<lb/>

<p>Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my<lb/>

<p>Discard, bully Hercules; cashier: let them wag; trot, trot.<lb/>

<p>I sit at ten pounds a week.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Host</speaker>
<p>Thou'rt an emperor, Caesar, Keisar, and Pheezar. I<lb/>
will entertain Bardolph; he shall draw, he shall<lb/>
tap: said I well, bully Hector?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Do so, good mine host.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Host</speaker>
<p>I have spoke; let him follow.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>To BARDOLPH</stage></p>


<p>
Let me see thee froth and lime: I am at a word; follow.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade:<lb/>
an old cloak makes a new jerkin; a withered<lb/>
serving-man a fresh tapster. Go; adieu.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BARDOLPH</speaker>
<p>It is a life that I have desired: I will thrive.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISTOL</speaker>
<p>O base Hungarian wight! wilt thou the spigot wield?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit BARDOLPH</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NYM</speaker>
<p>He was gotten in drink: is not the humour conceited?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox: his<lb/>
thefts were too open; his filching was like an<lb/>
unskilful singer; he kept not time.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NYM</speaker>
<p>The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISTOL</speaker>
<p>'Convey,' the wise it call. 'Steal!' foh! a fico<lb/>
for the phrase!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISTOL</speaker>
<p>Why, then, let kibes ensue.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>There is no remedy; I must cony-catch; I must shift.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISTOL</speaker>
<p>Young ravens must have food.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Which of you know Ford of this town?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISTOL</speaker>
<p>I ken the wight: he is of substance good.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISTOL</speaker>
<p>Two yards, and more.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>No quips now, Pistol! Indeed, I am in the waist two<lb/>
yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about<lb/>
thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford's<lb/>
wife: I spy entertainment in her; she discourses,<lb/>
she carves, she gives the leer of invitation: I<lb/>
can construe the action of her familiar style; and<lb/>
the hardest voice of her behavior, to be Englished<lb/>
rightly, is, 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISTOL</speaker>
<p>He hath studied her will, and translated her will,<lb/>
out of honesty into English.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NYM</speaker>
<p>The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her<lb/>
husband's purse: he hath a legion of angels.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISTOL</speaker>
<p>As many devils entertain; and 'To her, boy,' say I.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NYM</speaker>
<p>The humour rises; it is good: humour me the angels.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>I have writ me here a letter to her: and here<lb/>
another to Page's wife, who even now gave me good<lb/>
eyes too, examined my parts with most judicious<lb/>
oeillades; sometimes the beam of her view gilded my<lb/>
foot, sometimes my portly belly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISTOL</speaker>
<p>Then did the sun on dunghill shine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NYM</speaker>
<p>I thank thee for that humour.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>O, she did so course o'er my exteriors with such a<lb/>
greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye did<lb/>
seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here's<lb/>
another letter to her: she bears the purse too; she<lb/>
is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will<lb/>
be cheater to them both, and they shall be<lb/>
exchequers to me; they shall be my East and West<lb/>
Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go bear thou<lb/>
this letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to<lb/>
Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISTOL</speaker>
<p>Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,<lb/>
And by my side wear steel? then, Lucifer take all!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NYM</speaker>
<p>I will run no base humour: here, take the<lb/>
humour-letter: I will keep the havior of reputation.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p><stage>[To ROBIN]</stage></p><p>  Hold, sirrah, bear you these letters tightly;<lb/>
Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.<lb/>
Rogues, hence, avaunt! vanish like hailstones, go;<lb/>

Falstaff will learn the humour of the age,<lb/>
French thrift, you rogues; myself and skirted page.<lb/>

<p>Let vultures gripe thy guts! for gourd and fullam holds,<lb/>

Base Phrygian Turk!<lb/>

<p>I have operations which be humours of revenge.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISTOL</speaker>
<p>Wilt thou revenge?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NYM</speaker>
<p>By welkin and her star!<lb/>

<p>With wit or steel?<lb/>

<p>With both the humours, I:<lb/>
I will discuss the humour of this love to Page.<lb/>

How Falstaff, varlet vile,<lb/>

<p>My humour shall not cool: I will incense Page to<lb/>

Caius, coming. If he do, i' faith, and find any<lb/>

An honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant<lb/>

<p>No, forsooth: he hath but a little wee face, with a<lb/>
little yellow beard, a Cain-coloured beard.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMPLE</speaker>
<p>Ay, forsooth: but he is as tall a man of his hands<lb/>

so am I; ha, ha! then there's more sympathy: you<lb/>
love sack, and so do I; would you desire better<lb/>
sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,&mdash;at<lb/>
the least, if the love of soldier can suffice,&mdash;<lb/>
that I love thee. I will not say, pity me; 'tis<lb/>
not a soldier-like phrase: but I say, love me. By me,<lb/>
Thine own true knight,<lb/>
By day or night,<lb/>
Or any kind of light,<lb/>
With all his might<lb/>
For thee to fight,    JOHN FALSTAFF'<lb/>
What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked<lb/>
world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with<lb/>
age to show himself a young gallant! What an<lb/>
unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard<lb/>
picked&mdash;with the devil's name!&mdash;out of my<lb/>
conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me?<lb/>
Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What<lb/>
should I say to him? I was then frugal of my<lb/>
mirth: Heaven forgive me! Why, I'll exhibit a bill<lb/>
in the parliament for the putting down of men. How<lb/>
shall I be revenged on him? for revenged I will be,<lb/>
as sure as his guts are made of puddings.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Mistress Page! trust me, I was going to your house.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look very<lb/>
ill.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Nay, I'll ne'er believe that; I have to show to the contrary.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Faith, but you do, in my mind.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Well, I do then; yet I say I could show you to the<lb/>
contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>What's the matter, woman?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect, I<lb/>
could come to such honour!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Hang the trifle, woman! take the honour. What is<lb/>
it? dispense with trifles; what is it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so,<lb/>
I could be knighted.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>What? thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights<lb/>
will hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the<lb/>
article of thy gentry.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>We burn daylight: here, read, read; perceive how I<lb/>
might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat<lb/>
men, as long as I have an eye to make difference of<lb/>
men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised<lb/>
women's modesty; and gave such orderly and<lb/>
well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness, that I<lb/>
would have sworn his disposition would have gone to<lb/>
the truth of his words; but they do no more adhere<lb/>
and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to<lb/>
the tune of 'Green Sleeves.' What tempest, I trow,<lb/>
threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his<lb/>
belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged<lb/>
on him? I think the best way were to entertain him<lb/>
with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted<lb/>
him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and<lb/>
Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery<lb/>
of ill opinions, here's the twin-brother of thy<lb/>
letter: but let thine inherit first; for, I<lb/>
protest, mine never shall. I warrant he hath a<lb/>
thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for<lb/>
different names&mdash;sure, more,&mdash;and these are of the<lb/>
second edition: he will print them, out of doubt;<lb/>
for he cares not what he puts into the press, when<lb/>
he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess,<lb/>
and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you<lb/>
twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the very<lb/>
words. What doth he think of us?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Nay, I know not: it makes me almost ready to<lb/>
wrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertain<lb/>
myself like one that I am not acquainted withal;<lb/>
for, sure, unless he know some strain in me, that I<lb/>
know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>'Boarding,' call you it? I'll be sure to keep him<lb/>
above deck.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>So will I<lb/>
if he come under my hatches, I'll never<lb/>
to sea again. Let's be revenged on him: let's<lb/>
appoint him a meeting; give him a show of comfort in<lb/>
his suit and lead him on with a fine-baited delay,<lb/>
till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Nay, I will consent to act any villany against him,<lb/>
that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O,<lb/>
that my husband saw this letter! it would give<lb/>
eternal food to his jealousy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Why, look where he comes; and my good man too: he's<lb/>
as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause;<lb/>
and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>You are the happier woman.<lb/>

<p>Well, I hope it be not so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISTOL</speaker>
<p>Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs:<lb/>
Sir John affects thy wife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Why, sir, my wife is not young.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISTOL</speaker>
<p>He wooes both high and low, both rich and poor,<lb/>
Both young and old, one with another, Ford;<lb/>
He loves the gallimaufry: Ford, perpend.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Love my wife!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISTOL</speaker>
<p>With liver burning hot. Prevent, or go thou,<lb/>
Like Sir Actaeon he, with Ringwood at thy heels:<lb/>
O, odious is the name!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>What name, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PISTOL</speaker>
<p>The horn, I say. Farewell.<lb/>
Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night:<lb/>
Take heed, ere summer comes or cuckoo-birds do sing.<lb/>
Away, Sir Corporal Nym!<lb/>
Believe it, Page; he speaks sense.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NYM</speaker>
<p><stage>[To PAGE]</stage></p><p>  And this is true; I like not the humour<lb/>
of lying. He hath wronged me in some humours: I<lb/>
should have borne the humoured letter to her; but I<lb/>
have a sword and it shall bite upon my necessity.<lb/>
He loves your wife; there's the short and the long.<lb/>
My name is Corporal Nym; I speak and I avouch; 'tis<lb/>
true: my name is Nym and Falstaff loves your wife.<lb/>
Adieu. I love not the humour of bread and cheese,<lb/>
and there's the humour of it. Adieu.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>'The humour of it,' quoth a'! here's a fellow<lb/>
frights English out of his wits.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>I will seek out Falstaff.<lb/>

<p>I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>If I do find it: well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>I will not believe such a Cataian, though the priest<lb/>
o' the town commended him for a true man.<lb/>

<p>I melancholy! I am not melancholy. Get you home, go.<lb/>

<p>Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head. Now,<lb/>

<p>You are come to see my daughter Anne?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS QUICKLY</speaker>
<p>Ay, forsooth; and, I pray, how does good Mistress Anne?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Go in with us and see: we have an hour's talk with<lb/>
you.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and MISTRESS QUICKLY</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>How now, Master Ford!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>You heard what this knave told me, did you not?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Yes: and you heard what the other told me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Do you think there is truth in them?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would<lb/>
offer it: but these that accuse him in his intent<lb/>
towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men;<lb/>
very rogues, now they be out of service.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Were they his men?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Marry, were they.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at<lb/>
the Garter?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage<lb/>
towards my wife, I would turn her loose to him; and<lb/>
what he gets more of her than sharp words, let it<lb/>
lie on my head.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>I do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath to<lb/>
turn them together. A man may be too confident: I<lb/>
would have nothing lie on my head: I cannot be thus satisfied.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes:<lb/>
there is either liquor in his pate or money in his<lb/>
purse when he looks so merrily.<lb/>

Cavaleiro-justice, I say!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter SHALLOW</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Host</speaker>
<p>Tell him, cavaleiro-justice; tell him, bully-rook.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh<lb/>
the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Good mine host o' the Garter, a word with you.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Drawing him aside</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Host</speaker>
<p>What sayest thou, my bully-rook?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p><stage>[To PAGE]</stage></p><p>  Will you go with us to behold it? My<lb/>
merry host hath had the measuring of their weapons;<lb/>
and, I think, hath appointed them contrary places;<lb/>
for, believe me, I hear the parson is no jester.<lb/>
Hark, I will tell you what our sport shall be.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>They converse apart</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Host</speaker>
<p>Hast thou no suit against my knight, my<lb/>
guest-cavaleire?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>None, I protest: but I'll give you a pottle of<lb/>
burnt sack to give me recourse to him and tell him<lb/>
my name is Brook; only for a jest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Host</speaker>
<p>My hand, bully; thou shalt have egress and regress;<lb/>
&mdash;said I well?&mdash;and thy name shall be Brook. It is<lb/>
a merry knight. Will you go, An-heires?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Have with you, mine host.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in<lb/>
his rapier.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Tut, sir, I could have told you more. In these times<lb/>
you stand on distance, your passes, stoccadoes, and<lb/>
I know not what: 'tis the heart, Master Page; 'tis<lb/>
here, 'tis here. I have seen the time, with my long<lb/>
sword I would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Host</speaker>
<p>Here, boys, here, here! shall we wag?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Have with you. I would rather hear them scold than fight.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt Host, SHALLOW, and PAGE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Though Page be a secure fool, an stands so firmly<lb/>
on his wife's frailty, yet I cannot put off my<lb/>
opinion so easily: she was in his company at Page's<lb/>
house; and what they made there, I know not. Well,<lb/>
I will look further into't: and I have a disguise<lb/>
to sound Falstaff. If I find her honest, I lose not<lb/>
my labour; if she be otherwise, 'tis labour well bestowed.<lb/>

<p>Why, then the world's mine oyster.<lb/>
Which I with sword will open.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should<lb/>
lay my countenance to pawn; I have grated upon my<lb/>
good friends for three reprieves for you and your<lb/>
coach-fellow Nym; or else you had looked through<lb/>
the grate, like a geminy of baboons. I am damned in<lb/>
hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends, you were<lb/>
good soldiers and tall fellows; and when Mistress<lb/>
Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took't upon<lb/>
mine honour thou hadst it not.<lb/>

You'll not bear a letter for me, you rogue! you<lb/>

baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the<lb/>
terms of my honour precise: I, I, I myself<lb/>
sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand<lb/>

shuffle, to hedge and to lurch; and yet you, rogue,<lb/>
will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS QUICKLY</speaker>
<p>Marry, this is the short and the long of it; you<lb/>
have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis<lb/>
wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the<lb/>
court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her<lb/>
to such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and<lb/>
lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant<lb/>
you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift<lb/>
after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so<lb/>
rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in<lb/>
such alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of<lb/>
the best and the fairest, that would have won any<lb/>
woman's heart; and, I warrant you, they could never<lb/>
get an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angels<lb/>
given me this morning; but I defy all angels, in<lb/>
any such sort, as they say, but in the way of<lb/>
honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get<lb/>
her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of<lb/>
them all: and yet there has been earls, nay, which<lb/>
is more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>But what says she to me? be brief, my good<lb/>
she-Mercury.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS QUICKLY</speaker>
<p>Marry, she hath received your letter, for the which<lb/>
she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you<lb/>
to notify that her husband will be absence from his<lb/>
house between ten and eleven.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Ten and eleven?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS QUICKLY</speaker>
<p>Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the<lb/>
picture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford,<lb/>
her husband, will be from home. Alas! the sweet<lb/>
woman leads an ill life with him: he's a very<lb/>
jealousy man: she leads a very frampold life with<lb/>
him, good heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will<lb/>
not fail her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS QUICKLY</speaker>
<p>Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to<lb/>
your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty<lb/>
commendations to you too: and let me tell you in<lb/>
your ear, she's as fartuous a civil modest wife, and<lb/>
one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor<lb/>
evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe'er be the<lb/>
other: and she bade me tell your worship that her<lb/>
husband is seldom from home; but she hopes there<lb/>
will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon<lb/>
a man: surely I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Not I, I assure thee: setting the attractions of my<lb/>
good parts aside I have no other charms.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS QUICKLY</speaker>
<p>Blessing on your heart for't!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife and<lb/>
Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS QUICKLY</speaker>
<p>That were a jest indeed! they have not so little<lb/>
grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but<lb/>
Mistress Page would desire you to send her your<lb/>
little page, of all loves: her husband has a<lb/>
marvellous infection to the little page; and truly<lb/>
Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in<lb/>
Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what<lb/>
she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go<lb/>
to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as<lb/>
she will: and truly she deserves it; for if there<lb/>
be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must<lb/>
send her your page; no remedy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Why, I will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS QUICKLY</speaker>
<p>Nay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may come and<lb/>
go between you both; and in any case have a<lb/>
nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and<lb/>
the boy never need to understand any thing; for<lb/>
'tis not good that children should know any<lb/>
wickedness: old folks, you know, have discretion,<lb/>
as they say, and know the world.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Fare thee well: commend me to them both: there's<lb/>
my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with<lb/>
this woman.<lb/>

Such Brooks are welcome to me, that o'erflow such<lb/>

have I encompassed you? go to; via!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Bless you, sir!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>And you, sir! Would you speak with me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>I make bold to press with so little preparation upon<lb/>
you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>You're welcome. What's your will? Give us leave, drawer.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit BARDOLPH</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much; my name is Brook.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Good Sir John, I sue for yours: not to charge you;<lb/>
for I must let you understand I think myself in<lb/>
better plight for a lender than you are: the which<lb/>
hath something embolden'd me to this unseasoned<lb/>
intrusion; for they say, if money go before, all<lb/>
ways do lie open.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me:<lb/>
if you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or<lb/>
half, for easing me of the carriage.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Speak, good Master Brook: I shall be glad to be<lb/>
your servant.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Sir, I hear you are a scholar,&mdash;I will be brief<lb/>
with you,&mdash;and you have been a man long known to me,<lb/>
though I had never so good means, as desire, to make<lb/>
myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a<lb/>
thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine<lb/>
own imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you have<lb/>
one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,<lb/>
turn another into the register of your own; that I<lb/>
may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you<lb/>
yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Very well, sir; proceed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>There is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband's<lb/>
name is Ford.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Well, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>I have long loved her, and, I protest to you,<lb/>
bestowed much on her; followed her with a doting<lb/>
observance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;<lb/>
fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly<lb/>
give me sight of her; not only bought many presents<lb/>
to give her, but have given largely to many to know<lb/>
what she would have given; briefly, I have pursued<lb/>
her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the<lb/>
wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have<lb/>
merited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,<lb/>
I am sure, I have received none; unless experience<lb/>
be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite<lb/>
rate, and that hath taught me to say this:<lb/>

'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;<lb/>
Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Never.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Have you importuned her to such a purpose?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Never.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Of what quality was your love, then?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so<lb/>
that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place<lb/>
where I erected it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>When I have told you that, I have told you all.<lb/>
Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in<lb/>
other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that<lb/>
there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir<lb/>
John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a<lb/>
gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable<lb/>
discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your<lb/>
place and person, generally allowed for your many<lb/>
war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>O, sir!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Believe it, for you know it. There is money; spend<lb/>
it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only<lb/>
give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as<lb/>
to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this<lb/>
Ford's wife: use your art of wooing; win her to<lb/>
consent to you: if any man may, you may as soon as<lb/>
any.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Would it apply well to the vehemency of your<lb/>
affection, that I should win what you would enjoy?<lb/>
Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on<lb/>
the excellency of her honour, that the folly of my<lb/>
soul dares not present itself: she is too bright to<lb/>
be looked against. Now, could I could come to her<lb/>
with any detection in my hand, my desires had<lb/>
instance and argument to commend themselves: I<lb/>
could drive her then from the ward of her purity,<lb/>
her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand<lb/>
other her defences, which now are too too strongly<lb/>
embattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Master Brook, I will first make bold with your<lb/>
money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a<lb/>
gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>O good sir!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>I say you shall.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want<lb/>
none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her<lb/>
own appointment; even as you came in to me, her<lb/>
assistant or go-between parted from me: I say I<lb/>
shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at<lb/>
that time the jealous rascally knave her husband<lb/>
will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall<lb/>
know how I speed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford,<lb/>
sir?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not:<lb/>
yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the<lb/>
jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the<lb/>
which his wife seems to me well-favored. I will<lb/>
use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer;<lb/>
and there's my harvest-home.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him<lb/>
if you saw him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will<lb/>
stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my<lb/>
cudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o'er the<lb/>
cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I<lb/>
will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt<lb/>
lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night.<lb/>
Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style;<lb/>
thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and<lb/>
cuckold. Come to me soon at night.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is<lb/>
ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is<lb/>
improvident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him; the<lb/>
hour is fixed; the match is made. Would any man<lb/>
have thought this? See the hell of having a false<lb/>
woman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers<lb/>
ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not<lb/>
only receive this villanous wrong, but stand under<lb/>
the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that<lb/>
does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds<lb/>
well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are<lb/>
devils' additions, the names of fiends: but<lb/>
Cuckold! Wittol!&mdash;Cuckold! the devil himself hath<lb/>
not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass: he<lb/>
will trust his wife; he will not be jealous. I will<lb/>
rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh<lb/>
the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my<lb/>
aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling<lb/>
gelding, than my wife with herself; then she plots,<lb/>
then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they<lb/>
think in their hearts they may effect, they will<lb/>
break their hearts but they will effect. God be<lb/>
praised for my jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour.<lb/>
I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on<lb/>
Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it;<lb/>
better three hours too soon than a minute too late.<lb/>
Fie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!<lb/>

<p>Ha, do I perceive dat? have you make-a de sot of<lb/>
us, ha, ha?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>This is well; he has made us his vlouting-stog. I<lb/>
desire you that we may be friends; and let us knog<lb/>
our prains together to be revenge on this same<lb/>
scall, scurvy cogging companion, the host of the Garter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOCTOR CAIUS</speaker>
<p>By gar, with all my heart. He promise to bring me<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Nay, keep your way, little gallant; you were wont to<lb/>
be a follower, but now you are a leader. Whether<lb/>
had you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master's heels?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROBIN</speaker>
<p>I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man<lb/>
than follow him like a dwarf.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>O, you are a flattering boy: now I see you'll be a courtier.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter FORD</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for want<lb/>
of company. I think, if your husbands were dead,<lb/>
you two would marry.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Be sure of that,&mdash;two other husbands.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Where had you this pretty weather-cock?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>I cannot tell what the dickens his name is my<lb/>
husband had him of. What do you call your knight's<lb/>
name, sirrah?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROBIN</speaker>
<p>Sir John Falstaff.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Sir John Falstaff!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>He, he; I can never hit on's name. There is such a<lb/>
league between my good man and he! Is your wife at<lb/>
home indeed?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Indeed she is.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>By your leave, sir: I am sick till I see her.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Has Page any brains? hath he any eyes? hath he any<lb/>
thinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them.<lb/>
Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as<lb/>
easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve<lb/>
score. He pieces out his wife's inclination; he<lb/>
gives her folly motion and advantage: and now she's<lb/>
going to my wife, and Falstaff's boy with her. A<lb/>
man may hear this shower sing in the wind. And<lb/>
Falstaff's boy with her! Good plots, they are laid;<lb/>
and our revolted wives share damnation together.<lb/>
Well; I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck<lb/>
the borrowed veil of modesty from the so seeming<lb/>
Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and<lb/>
wilful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings all<lb/>
my neighbours shall cry aim.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Clock heard</stage></p>


<p>
The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me<lb/>
search: there I shall find Falstaff: I shall be<lb/>
rather praised for this than mocked; for it is as<lb/>
positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is<lb/>
there: I will go.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, SLENDER, Host,	SIR HUGH EVANS, DOCTOR CAIUS, and RUGBY</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW, PAGE, &amp;C.</speaker>
<p>Well met, Master Ford.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Trust me, a good knot: I have good cheer at home;<lb/>
and I pray you all go with me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>I must excuse myself, Master Ford.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>And so must I, sir: we have appointed to dine with<lb/>
Mistress Anne, and I would not break with her for<lb/>
more money than I'll speak of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>We have lingered about a match between Anne Page and<lb/>
my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have our answer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>I hope I have your good will, father Page.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>You have, Master Slender; I stand wholly for you:<lb/>
but my wife, master doctor, is for you altogether.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOCTOR CAIUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me: my nursh-a<lb/>
Quickly tell me so mush.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Host</speaker>
<p>What say you to young Master Fenton? he capers, he<lb/>
dances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he<lb/>
speaks holiday, he smells April and May: he will<lb/>
carry't, he will carry't; 'tis in his buttons; he<lb/>
will carry't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is<lb/>
of no having: he kept company with the wild prince<lb/>
and Poins; he is of too high a region; he knows too<lb/>
much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes<lb/>
with the finger of my substance: if he take her,<lb/>
let him take her simply; the wealth I have waits on<lb/>
my consent, and my consent goes not that way.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>I beseech you heartily, some of you go home with me<lb/>
to dinner: besides your cheer, you shall have<lb/>
sport; I will show you a monster. Master doctor,<lb/>
you shall go; so shall you, Master Page; and you, Sir Hugh.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Well, fare you well: we shall have the freer wooing<lb/>
at Master Page's.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt SHALLOW, and SLENDER</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOCTOR CAIUS</speaker>
<p>Go home, John Rugby; I come anon.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit RUGBY</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Host</speaker>
<p>Farewell, my hearts: I will to my honest knight<lb/>
Falstaff, and drink canary with him.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  I think I shall drink in pipe wine first<lb/>
with him; I'll make him dance. Will you go, gentles?<lb/>

<p>What, John! What, Robert!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Quickly, quickly! is the buck-basket&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>I warrant. What, Robin, I say!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Come, come, come.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Here, set it down.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Give your men the charge; we must be brief.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be<lb/>
ready here hard by in the brew-house: and when I<lb/>
suddenly call you, come forth, and without any pause<lb/>
or staggering take this basket on your shoulders:<lb/>
that done, trudge with it in all haste, and carry<lb/>
it among the whitsters in Datchet-mead, and there<lb/>
empty it in the muddy ditch close by the Thames side.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>You will do it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>I ha' told them over and over; they lack no<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt Servants</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Here comes little Robin.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter ROBIN</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>How now, my eyas-musket! what news with you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROBIN</speaker>
<p>My master, Sir John, is come in at your back-door,<lb/>
Mistress Ford, and requests your company.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been true to us?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROBIN</speaker>
<p>Ay, I'll be sworn. My master knows not of your<lb/>
being here and hath threatened to put me into<lb/>
everlasting liberty if I tell you of it; for he<lb/>
swears he'll turn me away.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Thou'rt a good boy: this secrecy of thine shall be<lb/>
a tailor to thee and shall make thee a new doublet<lb/>
and hose. I'll go hide me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Do so. Go tell thy master I am alone.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit ROBIN</stage></p>


<p>
Mistress Page, remember you your cue.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>I warrant thee; if I do not act it, hiss me.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Go to, then: we'll use this unwholesome humidity,<lb/>
this gross watery pumpion; we'll teach him to know<lb/>
turtles from jays.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter FALSTAFF</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel? Why, now let<lb/>
me die, for I have lived long enough: this is the<lb/>
period of my ambition: O this blessed hour!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>O sweet Sir John!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate,<lb/>
Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish: I would<lb/>
thy husband were dead: I'll speak it before the<lb/>
best lord; I would make thee my lady.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>I your lady, Sir John! alas, I should be a pitiful lady!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Let the court of France show me such another. I see<lb/>
how thine eye would emulate the diamond: thou hast<lb/>
the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the<lb/>
ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of<lb/>
Venetian admittance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>A plain kerchief, Sir John: my brows become nothing<lb/>
else; nor that well neither.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>By the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so: thou<lb/>
wouldst make an absolute courtier; and the firm<lb/>
fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion<lb/>
to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale. I see<lb/>
what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature<lb/>
thy friend. Come, thou canst not hide it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Believe me, there is no such thing in me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>What made me love thee? let that persuade thee<lb/>
there's something extraordinary in thee. Come, I<lb/>
cannot cog and say thou art this and that, like a<lb/>
many of these lisping hawthorn-buds, that come like<lb/>
women in men's apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury<lb/>
in simple time; I cannot: but I love thee; none<lb/>
but thee; and thou deservest it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Do not betray me, sir. I fear you love Mistress Page.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the<lb/>
Counter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek<lb/>
of a lime-kiln.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you shall one<lb/>
day find it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Keep in that mind; I'll deserve it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could not<lb/>
be in that mind.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROBIN</speaker>
<p><stage>[Within]</stage></p><p>  Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford! here's<lb/>
Mistress Page at the door, sweating and blowing and<lb/>
looking wildly, and would needs speak with you presently.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>She shall not see me: I will ensconce me behind the arras.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Pray you, do so: she's a very tattling woman.<lb/>

<p>
What's the matter? how now!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're shamed,<lb/>
you're overthrown, you're undone for ever!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>What's the matter, good Mistress Page?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>O well-a-day, Mistress Ford! having an honest man<lb/>
to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>What cause of suspicion?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>What cause of suspicion! Out pon you! how am I<lb/>
mistook in you!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Why, alas, what's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Your husband's coming hither, woman, with all the<lb/>
officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that<lb/>
he says is here now in the house by your consent, to<lb/>
take an ill advantage of his assence: you are undone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>'Tis not so, I hope.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Pray heaven it be not so, that you have such a man<lb/>
here! but 'tis most certain your husband's coming,<lb/>
with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such a<lb/>
one. I come before to tell you. If you know<lb/>
yourself clear, why, I am glad of it; but if you<lb/>
have a friend here convey, convey him out. Be not<lb/>
amazed; call all your senses to you; defend your<lb/>
reputation, or bid farewell to your good life for ever.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>What shall I do? There is a gentleman my dear<lb/>
friend; and I fear not mine own shame so much as his<lb/>
peril: I had rather than a thousand pound he were<lb/>
out of the house.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>For shame! never stand 'you had rather' and 'you<lb/>
had rather:' your husband's here at hand, bethink<lb/>
you of some conveyance: in the house you cannot<lb/>
hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here<lb/>
is a basket: if he be of any reasonable stature, he<lb/>
may creep in here; and throw foul linen upon him, as<lb/>
if it were going to bucking: or&mdash;it is whiting-time<lb/>
&mdash;send him by your two men to Datchet-mead.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>He's too big to go in there. What shall I do?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p><stage>[Coming forward]</stage></p><p>  Let me see't, let me see't, O, let<lb/>
me see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's<lb/>
counsel. I'll in.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>What, Sir John Falstaff! Are these your letters, knight?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>I love thee. Help me away. Let me creep in here.<lb/>
I'll never&mdash;<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Gets into the basket; they cover him with foul linen</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Help to cover your master, boy. Call your men,<lb/>
Mistress Ford. You dissembling knight!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>What, John! Robert! John!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter Servants</stage></p>


<p>

cowl-staff? look, how you drumble! Carry them to<lb/>
the laundress in Datchet-meat; quickly, come.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Pray you, come near: if I suspect without cause,<lb/>
why then make sport at me; then let me be your jest;<lb/>
I deserve it. How now! whither bear you this?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>To the laundress, forsooth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Why, what have you to do whither they bear it? You<lb/>
were best meddle with buck-washing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Buck! I would I could wash myself of the buck!<lb/>
Buck, buck, buck! Ay, buck; I warrant you, buck;<lb/>
and of the season too, it shall appear.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt Servants with the basket</stage></p>


<p>
Gentlemen, I have dreamed to-night; I'll tell you my<lb/>
dream. Here, here, here be my keys: ascend my<lb/>
chambers; search, seek, find out: I'll warrant<lb/>
we'll unkennel the fox. Let me stop this way first.<lb/>

So, now uncape.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Good Master Ford, be contented: you wrong yourself too much.<lb/>

<p>True, Master Page. Up, gentlemen: you shall see<lb/>
sport anon: follow me, gentlemen.<lb/>

<p>This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Nay, follow him, gentlemen; see the issue of his search.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt PAGE, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Is there not a double excellency in this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>I know not which pleases me better, that my husband<lb/>
is deceived, or Sir John.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>What a taking was he in when your husband asked who<lb/>
was in the basket!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>I am half afraid he will have need of washing; so<lb/>
throwing him into the water will do him a benefit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same<lb/>
strain were in the same distress.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>I think my husband hath some special suspicion of<lb/>
Falstaff's being here; for I never saw him so gross<lb/>
in his jealousy till now.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>I will lay a plot to try that; and we will yet have<lb/>
more tricks with Falstaff: his dissolute disease will<lb/>
scarce obey this medicine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress<lb/>
Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the<lb/>
water; and give him another hope, to betray him to<lb/>
another punishment?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>We will do it: let him be sent for to-morrow,<lb/>
eight o'clock, to have amends.<lb/>

<p>Ay, I do so.<lb/>

<p>Ay, ay; I must bear it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>If there be any pody in the house, and in the<lb/>
chambers, and in the coffers, and in the presses,<lb/>
heaven forgive my sins at the day of judgment!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOCTOR CAIUS</speaker>
<p>By gar, nor I too: there is no bodies.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Fie, fie, Master Ford! are you not ashamed? What<lb/>
spirit, what devil suggests this imagination? I<lb/>
would not ha' your distemper in this kind for the<lb/>
wealth of Windsor Castle.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>'Tis my fault, Master Page: I suffer for it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>You suffer for a pad conscience: your wife is as<lb/>
honest a 'omans as I will desires among five<lb/>
thousand, and five hundred too.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOCTOR CAIUS</speaker>
<p>By gar, I see 'tis an honest woman.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Well, I promised you a dinner. Come, come, walk in<lb/>
the Park: I pray you, pardon me; I will hereafter<lb/>

wife; come, Mistress Page. I pray you, pardon me;<lb/>
pray heartily, pardon me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Any thing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>If there is one, I shall make two in the company.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FENTON</speaker>
<p>No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!<lb/>
Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth<lb/>
Was the first motive that I woo'd thee, Anne:<lb/>
Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value<lb/>
Than stamps in gold or sums in sealed bags;<lb/>
And 'tis the very riches of thyself<lb/>
That now I aim at.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANNE PAGE</speaker>
<p>Gentle Master Fenton,<lb/>
Yet seek my father's love; still seek it, sir:<lb/>
If opportunity and humblest suit<lb/>
Cannot attain it, why, then,&mdash;hark you hither!<lb/>

<p>I'll make a shaft or a bolt on't: 'slid, 'tis but<lb/>

<p>No, she shall not dismay me: I care not for that,<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
This is my father's choice.<lb/>
O, what a world of vile ill-favor'd faults<lb/>
Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a-year!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS QUICKLY</speaker>
<p>And how does good Master Fenton? Pray you, a word with you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>She's coming; to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a father!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>I had a father, Mistress Anne; my uncle can tell you<lb/>
good jests of him. Pray you, uncle, tell Mistress<lb/>
Anne the jest, how my father stole two geese out of<lb/>
a pen, good uncle.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>Ay, that I do; as well as I love any woman in<lb/>
Gloucestershire.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>Ay, that I will, come cut and long-tail, under the<lb/>
degree of a squire.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds jointure.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANNE PAGE</speaker>
<p>Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SHALLOW</speaker>
<p>Marry, I thank you for it; I thank you for that good<lb/>
comfort. She calls you, coz: I'll leave you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>My will! 'od's heartlings, that's a pretty jest<lb/>
indeed! I ne'er made my will yet, I thank heaven; I<lb/>
am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANNE PAGE</speaker>
<p>I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>Truly, for mine own part, I would little or nothing<lb/>
with you. Your father and my uncle hath made<lb/>
motions: if it be my luck, so; if not, happy man be<lb/>
his dole! They can tell you how things go better<lb/>

I told you, sir, my daughter is disposed of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FENTON</speaker>
<p>Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.<lb/>

<p>Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter<lb/>
In such a righteous fashion as I do,<lb/>
Perforce, against all cheques, rebukes and manners,<lb/>
I must advance the colours of my love<lb/>
And not retire: let me have your good will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANNE PAGE</speaker>
<p>Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS QUICKLY</speaker>
<p>That's my master, master doctor.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANNE PAGE</speaker>
<p>Alas, I had rather be set quick i' the earth<lb/>
And bowl'd to death with turnips!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Come, trouble not yourself. Good Master Fenton,<lb/>
I will not be your friend nor enemy:<lb/>
My daughter will I question how she loves you,<lb/>
And as I find her, so am I affected.<lb/>
Till then farewell, sir: she must needs go in;<lb/>
Her father will be angry.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FENTON</speaker>
<p>Farewell, gentle mistress: farewell, Nan.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE and ANNE PAGE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS QUICKLY</speaker>
<p>This is my doing, now: 'Nay,' said I, 'will you cast<lb/>
away your child on a fool, and a physician? Look on<lb/>
Master Fenton:' this is my doing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FENTON</speaker>
<p>I thank thee; and I pray thee, once to-night<lb/>
Give my sweet Nan this ring: there's for thy pains.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS QUICKLY</speaker>
<p>Now heaven send thee good fortune!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit FENTON</stage></p>


<p>
A kind heart he hath: a woman would run through<lb/>
fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I<lb/>
would my master had Mistress Anne; or I would<lb/>
Master Slender had her; or, in sooth, I would Master<lb/>
Fenton had her; I will do what I can for them all<lb/>
three; for so I have promised, and I'll be as good<lb/>
as my word; but speciously for Master Fenton. Well,<lb/>
I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from<lb/>
my two mistresses: what a beast am I to slack it!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit BARDOLPH</stage></p>


<p>
Have I lived to be carried in a basket, like a<lb/>
barrow of butcher's offal, and to be thrown in the<lb/>
Thames? Well, if I be served such another trick,<lb/>
I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered, and give<lb/>
them to a dog for a new-year's gift. The rogues<lb/>
slighted me into the river with as little remorse as<lb/>
they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies,<lb/>
fifteen i' the litter: and you may know by my size<lb/>
that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the<lb/>
bottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I had<lb/>
been drowned, but that the shore was shelvy and<lb/>
shallow,&mdash;a death that I abhor; for the water swells<lb/>
a man; and what a thing should I have been when I<lb/>
had been swelled! I should have been a mountain of mummy.<lb/>

<p>Marry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress Ford.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Mistress Ford! I have had ford enough; I was thrown<lb/>
into the ford; I have my belly full of ford.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS QUICKLY</speaker>
<p>Alas the day! good heart, that was not her fault:<lb/>
she does so take on with her men; they mistook their erection.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman's promise.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS QUICKLY</speaker>
<p>Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn<lb/>
your heart to see it. Her husband goes this morning<lb/>
a-birding; she desires you once more to come to her<lb/>
between eight and nine: I must carry her word<lb/>
quickly: she'll make you amends, I warrant you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Well, I will visit her: tell her so; and bid her<lb/>
think what a man is: let her consider his frailty,<lb/>
and then judge of my merit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS QUICKLY</speaker>
<p>I will tell her.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Do so. Between nine and ten, sayest thou?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter FORD</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Bless you, sir!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Now, master Brook, you come to know what hath passed<lb/>
between me and Ford's wife?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>That, indeed, Sir John, is my business.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Master Brook, I will not lie to you: I was at her<lb/>
house the hour she appointed me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>And sped you, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>How so, sir? Did she change her determination?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>No, Master Brook; but the peaking Cornuto her<lb/>
husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual<lb/>
'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our<lb/>
encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,<lb/>
and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy;<lb/>
and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither<lb/>
provoked and instigated by his distemper, and,<lb/>
forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>What, while you were there?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>While I was there.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>And did he search for you, and could not find you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes<lb/>
in one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford's<lb/>
approach; and, in her invention and Ford's wife's<lb/>
distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>A buck-basket!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul<lb/>
shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy<lb/>
napkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankest<lb/>
compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>And how long lay you there?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have<lb/>
suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.<lb/>
Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's<lb/>
knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their<lb/>
mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to<lb/>
Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met<lb/>
the jealous knave their master in the door, who<lb/>
asked them once or twice what they had in their<lb/>
basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave<lb/>
would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he<lb/>
should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he<lb/>
for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But<lb/>
mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs<lb/>
of three several deaths; first, an intolerable<lb/>
fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten<lb/>
bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good<lb/>
bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to<lb/>
point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,<lb/>
like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes<lb/>
that fretted in their own grease: think of that,&mdash;a<lb/>
man of my kidney,&mdash;think of that,&mdash;that am as subject<lb/>
to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution<lb/>
and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.<lb/>
And in the height of this bath, when I was more than<lb/>
half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be<lb/>
thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,<lb/>
in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of<lb/>
that,&mdash;hissing hot,&mdash;think of that, Master Brook.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>In good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake you<lb/>
have sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;<lb/>
you'll undertake her no more?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have<lb/>
been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her<lb/>
husband is this morning gone a-birding: I have<lb/>
received from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt<lb/>
eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>'Tis past eight already, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Is it? I will then address me to my appointment.<lb/>
Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall<lb/>
know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be<lb/>
crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall<lb/>
have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall<lb/>
cuckold Ford.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Hum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do I<lb/>
sleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!<lb/>
there's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.<lb/>
This 'tis to be married! this 'tis to have linen<lb/>
and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself<lb/>
what I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at my<lb/>
house; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible he<lb/>
should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,<lb/>
nor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that<lb/>
guides him should aid him, I will search<lb/>
impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,<lb/>
yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame:<lb/>
if I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go<lb/>
with me: I'll be horn-mad.<lb/>

<p>Why, none but mine own people.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Why?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again:<lb/>
he so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails<lb/>
against all married mankind; so curses all Eve's<lb/>
daughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets<lb/>
himself on the forehead, crying, 'Peer out, peer<lb/>
out!' that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but<lb/>
tameness, civility and patience, to this his<lb/>
distemper he is in now: I am glad the fat knight is not here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Why, does he talk of him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Of none but him; and swears he was carried out, the<lb/>
last time he searched for him, in a basket; protests<lb/>
to my husband he is now here, and hath drawn him and<lb/>
the rest of their company from their sport, to make<lb/>
another experiment of his suspicion: but I am glad<lb/>
the knight is not here; now he shall see his own foolery.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>How near is he, Mistress Page?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Hard by; at street end; he will be here anon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>I am undone! The knight is here.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Why then you are utterly shamed, and he's but a dead<lb/>
man. What a woman are you!&mdash;Away with him, away<lb/>
with him! better shame than murder.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Which way should be go? how should I bestow him?<lb/>
Shall I put him into the basket again?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter FALSTAFF</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>No, I'll come no more i' the basket. May I not go<lb/>
out ere he come?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Alas, three of Master Ford's brothers watch the door<lb/>
with pistols, that none shall issue out; otherwise<lb/>
you might slip away ere he came. But what make you here?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>What shall I do? I'll creep up into the chimney.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>There they always use to discharge their<lb/>
birding-pieces. Creep into the kiln-hole.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Where is it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>He will seek there, on my word. Neither press,<lb/>
coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an<lb/>
abstract for the remembrance of such places, and<lb/>
goes to them by his note: there is no hiding you in the house.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>I'll go out then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>If you go out in your own semblance, you die, Sir<lb/>
John. Unless you go out disguised&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>How might we disguise him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Alas the day, I know not! There is no woman's gown<lb/>
big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat,<lb/>
a muffler and a kerchief, and so escape.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Good hearts, devise something: any extremity rather<lb/>
than a mischief.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>My maid's aunt, the fat woman of Brentford, has a<lb/>
gown above.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>On my word, it will serve him; she's as big as he<lb/>
is: and there's her thrummed hat and her muffler<lb/>
too. Run up, Sir John.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Go, go, sweet Sir John: Mistress Page and I will<lb/>
look some linen for your head.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Quick, quick! we'll come dress you straight: put<lb/>
on the gown the while.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit FALSTAFF</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>I would my husband would meet him in this shape: he<lb/>
cannot abide the old woman of Brentford; he swears<lb/>
she's a witch; forbade her my house and hath<lb/>
threatened to beat her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel, and the<lb/>
devil guide his cudgel afterwards!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>But is my husband coming?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Ah, in good sadness, is he; and talks of the basket<lb/>
too, howsoever he hath had intelligence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>We'll try that; for I'll appoint my men to carry the<lb/>
basket again, to meet him at the door with it, as<lb/>
they did last time.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Nay, but he'll be here presently: let's go dress him<lb/>
like the witch of Brentford.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>I'll first direct my men what they shall do with the<lb/>
basket. Go up; I'll bring linen for him straight.<lb/>

villain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket!<lb/>

<p>Why, man, why?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed<lb/>
out of my house yesterday in this basket: why may<lb/>
not he be there again? In my house I am sure he is:<lb/>
my intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable.<lb/>
Pluck me out all the linen.<lb/>

<p>Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Well, he's not here I seek for.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Help to search my house this one time. If I find<lb/>
not what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let<lb/>
me for ever be your table-sport; let them say of<lb/>
me, 'As jealous as Ford, Chat searched a hollow<lb/>
walnut for his wife's leman.' Satisfy me once more;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Nay, it is my maid's aunt of Brentford.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not<lb/>
forbid her my house? She comes of errands, does<lb/>
she? We are simple men; we do not know what's<lb/>
brought to pass under the profession of<lb/>
fortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells,<lb/>
by the figure, and such daubery as this is, beyond<lb/>
our element we know nothing. Come down, you witch,<lb/>

I spy a great peard under his muffler.<lb/>

womanhood and the witness of a good conscience,<lb/>
pursue him with any further revenge?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>The spirit of wantonness is, sure, scared out of<lb/>
him: if the devil have him not in fee-simple, with<lb/>
fine and recovery, he will never, I think, in the<lb/>
way of waste, attempt us again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Shall we tell our husbands how we have served him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Yes, by all means; if it be but to scrape the<lb/>
figures out of your husband's brains. If they can<lb/>
find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight<lb/>
shall be any further afflicted, we two will still be<lb/>
the ministers.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>'Tis one of the best discretions of a 'oman as ever<lb/>
I did look upon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>And did he send you both these letters at an instant?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Within a quarter of an hour.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt;<lb/>
I rather will suspect the sun with cold<lb/>
Than thee with wantonness: now doth thy honour stand<lb/>
In him that was of late an heretic,<lb/>
As firm as faith.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>'Tis well, 'tis well; no more:<lb/>
Be not as extreme in submission<lb/>
As in offence.<lb/>
But let our plot go forward: let our wives<lb/>
Yet once again, to make us public sport,<lb/>
Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,<lb/>
Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>There is no better way than that they spoke of.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>How? to send him word they'll meet him in the park<lb/>
at midnight? Fie, fie! he'll never come.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>You say he has been thrown in the rivers and has<lb/>
been grievously peaten as an old 'oman: methinks<lb/>
there should be terrors in him that he should not<lb/>
come; methinks his flesh is punished, he shall have<lb/>
no desires.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>So think I too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,<lb/>
And let us two devise to bring him thither.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,<lb/>
Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,<lb/>
Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,<lb/>
Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;<lb/>
And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle<lb/>
And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain<lb/>
In a most hideous and dreadful manner:<lb/>
You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know<lb/>
The superstitious idle-headed eld<lb/>
Received and did deliver to our age<lb/>
This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Why, yet there want not many that do fear<lb/>
In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak:<lb/>
But what of this?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>Marry, this is our device;<lb/>
That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come:<lb/>
And in this shape when you have brought him thither,<lb/>
What shall be done with him? what is your plot?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:<lb/>
Nan Page my daughter and my little son<lb/>
And three or four more of their growth we'll dress<lb/>
Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white,<lb/>
With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,<lb/>
And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,<lb/>
As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,<lb/>
Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once<lb/>
With some diffused song: upon their sight,<lb/>
We two in great amazedness will fly:<lb/>
Then let them all encircle him about<lb/>
And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight,<lb/>
And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,<lb/>
In their so sacred paths he dares to tread<lb/>
In shape profane.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS FORD</speaker>
<p>And till he tell the truth,<lb/>
Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound<lb/>
And burn him with their tapers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>The truth being known,<lb/>
We'll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,<lb/>
And mock him home to Windsor.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>The children must<lb/>
Be practised well to this, or they'll ne'er do't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>I will teach the children their behaviors; and I<lb/>
will be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the<lb/>
knight with my taber.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>That will be excellent. I'll go and buy them vizards.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,<lb/>
Finely attired in a robe of white.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>That silk will I go buy.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>

And in that time<lb/>
Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away<lb/>
And marry her at Eton. Go send to Falstaff straight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook<lb/>
He'll tell me all his purpose: sure, he'll come.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Fear not you that. Go get us properties<lb/>
And tricking for our fairies.<lb/>

honest knaveries.<lb/>

I'll to the doctor: he hath my good will,<lb/>
And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.<lb/>
That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot;<lb/>
And he my husband best of all affects.<lb/>
The doctor is well money'd, and his friends<lb/>
Potent at court: he, none but he, shall have her,<lb/>
Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.<lb/>

have her or no.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>'Tis, 'tis his fortune.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMPLE</speaker>
<p>What, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>To have her, or no. Go; say the woman told me so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMPLE</speaker>
<p>May I be bold to say so, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Ay, sir; like who more bold.<lb/>

<p>Ay, that there was, mine host; one that hath taught<lb/>
me more wit than ever I learned before in my life;<lb/>

my learning.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BARDOLPH</speaker>
<p>Run away with the cozeners; for so soon as I came<lb/>
beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of<lb/>
them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away,<lb/>
like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.<lb/>

<p>What is the matter, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>Have a care of your entertainments: there is a<lb/>
friend of mine come to town tells me there is three<lb/>
cozen-germans that has cozened all the hosts of<lb/>
Readins, of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and<lb/>
money. I tell you for good will, look you: you<lb/>
are wise and full of gibes and vlouting-stocks, and<lb/>
'tis not convenient you should be cozened. Fare you well.<lb/>

<p>Here, master doctor, in perplexity and doubtful dilemma.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOCTOR CAIUS</speaker>
<p>I cannot tell vat is dat: but it is tell-a me dat<lb/>
you make grand preparation for a duke de Jamany: by<lb/>

come. I tell you for good vill: adieu.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt Host and BARDOLPH</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>I would all the world might be cozened; for I have<lb/>
been cozened and beaten too. If it should come to<lb/>
the ear of the court, how I have been transformed<lb/>
and how my transformation hath been washed and<lb/>
cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by<lb/>
drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me; I warrant<lb/>
they would whip me with their fine wits till I were<lb/>
as crest-fallen as a dried pear. I never prospered<lb/>
since I forswore myself at primero. Well, if my<lb/>
wind were but long enough to say my prayers, I would repent.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY</stage></p>


<p>
Now, whence come you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS QUICKLY</speaker>
<p>From the two parties, forsooth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>The devil take one party and his dam the other! and<lb/>
so they shall be both bestowed. I have suffered more<lb/>
for their sakes, more than the villanous inconstancy<lb/>
of man's disposition is able to bear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS QUICKLY</speaker>
<p>And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant;<lb/>
speciously one of them; Mistress Ford, good heart,<lb/>
is beaten black and blue, that you cannot see a<lb/>
white spot about her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>What tellest thou me of black and blue? I was<lb/>
beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow;<lb/>
and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of<lb/>
Brentford: but that my admirable dexterity of wit,<lb/>
my counterfeiting the action of an old woman,<lb/>
delivered me, the knave constable had set me i' the<lb/>
stocks, i' the common stocks, for a witch.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS QUICKLY</speaker>
<p>Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber: you<lb/>
shall hear how things go; and, I warrant, to your<lb/>
content. Here is a letter will say somewhat. Good<lb/>
hearts, what ado here is to bring you together!<lb/>
Sure, one of you does not serve heaven well, that<lb/>
you are so crossed.<lb/>

<p>I will hear you, Master Fenton; and I will at the<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FENTON</speaker>
<p>From time to time I have acquainted you<lb/>
With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;<lb/>
Who mutually hath answer'd my affection,<lb/>
So far forth as herself might be her chooser,<lb/>
Even to my wish: I have a letter from her<lb/>
Of such contents as you will wonder at;<lb/>
The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,<lb/>
That neither singly can be manifested,<lb/>
Without the show of both; fat Falstaff<lb/>
Hath a great scene: the image of the jest<lb/>
I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.<lb/>
To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,<lb/>
Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;<lb/>
The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,<lb/>
While other jests are something rank on foot,<lb/>
Her father hath commanded her to slip<lb/>
Away with Slender and with him at Eton<lb/>
Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,<lb/>
Her mother, ever strong against that match<lb/>
And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed<lb/>
That he shall likewise shuffle her away,<lb/>
While other sports are tasking of their minds,<lb/>
And at the deanery, where a priest attends,<lb/>
Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot<lb/>
She seemingly obedient likewise hath<lb/>
Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:<lb/>
Her father means she shall be all in white,<lb/>
And in that habit, when Slender sees his time<lb/>
To take her by the hand and bid her go,<lb/>
She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,<lb/>
The better to denote her to the doctor,<lb/>
For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,<lb/>
That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,<lb/>
With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;<lb/>
And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,<lb/>
To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,<lb/>
The maid hath given consent to go with him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Host</speaker>
<p>Which means she to deceive, father or mother?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FENTON</speaker>
<p>Both, my good host, to go along with me:<lb/>
And here it rests, that you'll procure the vicar<lb/>
To stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one,<lb/>
And, in the lawful name of marrying,<lb/>
To give our hearts united ceremony.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Host</speaker>
<p>Well, husband your device; I'll to the vicar:<lb/>
Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.<lb/>

poor old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband,<lb/>
hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him,<lb/>
Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell<lb/>
you: he beat me grievously, in the shape of a<lb/>
woman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear<lb/>
not Goliath with a weaver's beam; because I know<lb/>
also life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along<lb/>
with me: I'll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I<lb/>
plucked geese, played truant and whipped top, I knew<lb/>
not what 'twas to be beaten till lately. Follow<lb/>
me: I'll tell you strange things of this knave<lb/>
Ford, on whom to-night I will be revenged, and I<lb/>

Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa; love<lb/>
set on thy horns. O powerful love! that, in some<lb/>
respects, makes a beast a man, in some other, a man<lb/>
a beast. You were also, Jupiter, a swan for the love<lb/>
of Leda. O omnipotent Love! how near the god drew<lb/>
to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in<lb/>
the form of a beast. O Jove, a beastly fault! And<lb/>
then another fault in the semblance of a fowl; think<lb/>
on 't, Jove; a foul fault! When gods have hot<lb/>
backs, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a<lb/>
Windsor stag; and the fattest, I think, i' the<lb/>
forest. Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can<lb/>

SONG.<lb/>
Fie on sinful fantasy!<lb/>
Fie on lust and luxury!<lb/>
Lust is but a bloody fire,<lb/>
Kindled with unchaste desire,<lb/>
Fed in heart, whose flames aspire<lb/>
As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.<lb/>
Pinch him, fairies, mutually;<lb/>
Pinch him for his villany;<lb/>
Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,<lb/>
Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.<lb/>

<p>Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,<lb/>
Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his<lb/>
horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath<lb/>
enjoyed nothing of Ford's but his buck-basket, his<lb/>
cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be<lb/>
paid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for<lb/>
it, Master Brook.<lb/>

I will never take you for my love again; but I will<lb/>
always count you my deer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Ay, and an ox too: both the proofs are extant.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>And these are not fairies? I was three or four<lb/>
times in the thought they were not fairies: and yet<lb/>
the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my<lb/>
powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a<lb/>
received belief, in despite of the teeth of all<lb/>
rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now<lb/>
how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when 'tis upon<lb/>
ill employment!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your<lb/>
desires, and fairies will not pinse you.<lb/>

<p>And leave your jealousies too, I pray you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art<lb/>
able to woo her in good English.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that<lb/>
it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as<lb/>
this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I<lb/>
have a coxcomb of frize? 'Tis time I were choked<lb/>
with a piece of toasted cheese.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all putter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>'Seese' and 'putter'! have I lived to stand at the<lb/>
taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This<lb/>
is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking<lb/>
through the realm.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Why Sir John, do you think, though we would have the<lb/>
virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders<lb/>
and have given ourselves without scruple to hell,<lb/>
that ever the devil could have made you our delight?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>A puffed man?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Old, cold, withered and of intolerable entrails?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>And one that is as slanderous as Satan?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>And as poor as Job?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>And as wicked as his wife?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIR HUGH EVANS</speaker>
<p>And given to fornications, and to taverns and sack<lb/>
and wine and metheglins, and to drinkings and<lb/>
swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>Well, I am your theme: you have the start of me; I<lb/>
am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh<lb/>
flannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me: use<lb/>
me as you will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to one<lb/>
Master Brook, that you have cozened of money, to<lb/>
whom you should have been a pander: over and above<lb/>
that you have suffered, I think to repay that money<lb/>
will be a biting affliction.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Yet be cheerful, knight: thou shalt eat a posset<lb/>
to-night at my house; where I will desire thee to<lb/>
laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee: tell her<lb/>
Master Slender hath married her daughter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Doctors doubt that: if Anne Page be my<lb/>
daughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius' wife.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter SLENDER</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>Whoa ho! ho, father Page!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Son, how now! how now, son! have you dispatched?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>Dispatched! I'll make the best in Gloucestershire<lb/>
know on't; would I were hanged, la, else.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Of what, son?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page,<lb/>
and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not been<lb/>
i' the church, I would have swinged him, or he<lb/>
should have swinged me. If I did not think it had<lb/>
been Anne Page, would I might never stir!&mdash;and 'tis<lb/>
a postmaster's boy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took<lb/>
a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for<lb/>
all he was in woman's apparel, I would not have had<lb/>
him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how<lb/>
you should know my daughter by her garments?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SLENDER</speaker>
<p>I went to her in white, and cried 'mum,' and she<lb/>
cried 'budget,' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet<lb/>
it was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose;<lb/>
turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, she is<lb/>
now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter DOCTOR CAIUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOCTOR CAIUS</speaker>
<p>Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha'<lb/>
married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy;<lb/>
it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Why, did you take her in green?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOCTOR CAIUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, by gar, and 'tis a boy: by gar, I'll raise all Windsor.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>My heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE</stage></p>


<p>
How now, Master Fenton!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANNE PAGE</speaker>
<p>Pardon, good father! good my mother, pardon!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Why went you not with master doctor, maid?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FENTON</speaker>
<p>You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.<lb/>
You would have married her most shamefully,<lb/>
Where there was no proportion held in love.<lb/>
The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,<lb/>
Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.<lb/>
The offence is holy that she hath committed;<lb/>
And this deceit loses the name of craft,<lb/>
Of disobedience, or unduteous title,<lb/>
Since therein she doth evitate and shun<lb/>
A thousand irreligious cursed hours,<lb/>
Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Stand not amazed; here is no remedy:<lb/>
In love the heavens themselves do guide the state;<lb/>
Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand to<lb/>
strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PAGE</speaker>
<p>Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy!<lb/>
What cannot be eschew'd must be embraced.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FALSTAFF</speaker>
<p>When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MISTRESS PAGE</speaker>
<p>Well, I will muse no further. Master Fenton,<lb/>
Heaven give you many, many merry days!<lb/>
Good husband, let us every one go home,<lb/>
And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;<lb/>
Sir John and all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FORD</speaker>
<p>Let it be so. Sir John,<lb/>
To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word<lb/>
For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage></p>
