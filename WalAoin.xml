<head>NOTE ON AOI NO UYE.</head> 
 
<p> 
At the age of twelve Prince Genji went through the ceremony of marriage 
with Aoi no Uye (Princess Hollyhock), the Prime Minister's daughter. She 
continued to live at her father's house and Genji at his palace. When he 
was about sixteen he fell in love with Princess Rokujo&commacr;, the widow of 
the Emperor's brother; she was about eight years older than himself. He 
was not long faithful to her. The lady Y&umacr;gao next engaged his 
affections. He carried her one night to a deserted mansion on the 
outskirts of the City. "The night was far advanced and they had both 
fallen asleep. Suddenly the figure of a woman appeared at the bedside. "I 
have found you!" it cried. "What stranger is this that lies beside you? 
What treachery is this that you flaunt before my eyes?" And with these 
words the apparition stooped over the bed, and made as though to drag away 
the sleeping girl from Genji's side." 
<ref target="n143.1">[1]</ref> 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Before dawn Y&umacr;gao was dead, stricken by the "living phantom" of 
Rokujo&commacr;, embodiment of her baleful jealousy. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Soon after this, Genji became reconciled with his wife Aoi, but continued 
to visit Rokujo&commacr;. One day, at the Kamo Festival, Aoi's way was 
blocked by another carriage. She ordered her attendants to drag it aside. 
A scuffle ensued between her servants and those of Rokujo&commacr; (for she 
was the occupant of the second carriage) in which Aoi's side prevailed. 
Rokujo&commacr;'s carriage was broken and Aoi's pushed into the front place. 
After the festival was over Aoi returned to the Prime Minister's house in 
high spirits. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Soon afterwards she fell ill, and it is at this point that the play 
begins. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
There is nothing obscure or ambiguous in the situation. Fenollosa seems to 
have misunderstood the play and read into it complications and confusions 
which do not exist. He also changes the sex of the Witch, though the 
Japanese word, <hi rend="italic">miko</hi>, always 
has a feminine meaning. The "Romance of Genji" (<hi rend="italic">Genji 
Monogatari</hi>) was written by Lady Murasaki Shikibu and was finished 
in the year 1004 A. D. Of its fifty-four chapters only seventeen have been 
translated. 
<ref target="n143.2">[2]</ref> 
 It furnished the plots of many No&commacr; plays, of which <hi rend="italic">Suma 
Genji</hi> (Genji's exile 
 
 
<pb n="144"/>  
at Suma), <hi rend="italic">No no Miya</hi> (his visit to Rokujo&commacr; after she 
became a nun), <hi rend="italic">Tamakatsura</hi> (the story of Yu&commacr;gao's 
daughter), and <hi rend="italic">Hajitomi</hi> (in which Yu&commacr;gao's ghost 
appears) are the best known. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
There is some doubt about the authorship of the play. Seami saw it acted 
as a Dengaku by his father's contemporary Inu&commacr;o. He describes 
Inu&commacr;o's entry on to the stage in the role of Rukujo&commacr; and quotes 
the first six lines of her opening speech. These lines correspond exactly 
with the modern text, and it is probable that the play existed in 
something like its present form in the middle of the fourteenth century. 
Kwanze Nagatoshi, the great-grandson of Seami, includes it in a list of 
Seami's works; while popular tradition ascribes it to Seami's son-in-law 
Zenchiku.

I am a courtier in the service of the Emperor Shujaku. You must know that 
the Prime Minister's daughter, Princess Aoi, has fallen sick. We have sent 
for abbots and high-priests, of the Greater School and of the Secret 
School, but they could not cure her.

And now, here at my side, stands the witch of Teruhi,

 a famous diviner with the bow-string. My lord has been told that by 
twanging her bow-string she can make visible an evil spirit and tell if it 
be the spirit of a living man or a dead. So he bade me send for her and 
let her pluck her string.

till their father lured them out by the promise that they would find those 
little toy coaches awaiting them. So Buddha, by partial truth, lures men 
from the "burning house" of their material lives. Owing to the episode at
