<p><stage>A camp near Forres.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN,	LENNOX, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>DUNCAN</speaker>
<p>What bloody man is that? He can report,<lb/>
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt<lb/>
The newest state.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>This is the sergeant<lb/>
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought<lb/>
'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!<lb/>
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil<lb/>
As thou didst leave it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Sergeant</speaker>
<p>Doubtful it stood;<lb/>
As two spent swimmers, that do cling together<lb/>
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald&mdash;<lb/>
Worthy to be a rebel, for to that<lb/>
The multiplying villanies of nature<lb/>
Do swarm upon him&mdash;from the western isles<lb/>
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;<lb/>
And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,<lb/>
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:<lb/>
For brave Macbeth&mdash;well he deserves that name&mdash;<lb/>
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,<lb/>
Which smoked with bloody execution,<lb/>
Like valour's minion carved out his passage<lb/>
Till he faced the slave;<lb/>
Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,<lb/>
Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,<lb/>
And fix'd his head upon our battlements.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUNCAN</speaker>
<p>O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Sergeant</speaker>
<p>As whence the sun 'gins his reflection<lb/>
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,<lb/>
So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come<lb/>
Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:<lb/>
No sooner justice had with valour arm'd<lb/>
Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,<lb/>
But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,<lb/>
With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men<lb/>
Began a fresh assault.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUNCAN</speaker>
<p>Dismay'd not this<lb/>
Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Sergeant</speaker>
<p>Yes;<lb/>
As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.<lb/>
If I say sooth, I must report they were<lb/>
As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they<lb/>
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:<lb/>
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,<lb/>
Or memorise another Golgotha,<lb/>
I cannot tell.<lb/>
But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUNCAN</speaker>
<p>So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;<lb/>
They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit Sergeant, attended</stage></p>


<p>
Who comes here?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter ROSS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>The worthy thane of Ross.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LENNOX</speaker>
<p>What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look<lb/>
That seems to speak things strange.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>God save the king!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUNCAN</speaker>
<p>Whence camest thou, worthy thane?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>From Fife, great king;<lb/>
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky<lb/>
And fan our people cold. Norway himself,<lb/>
With terrible numbers,<lb/>
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor<lb/>
The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;<lb/>
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,<lb/>
Confronted him with self-comparisons,<lb/>
Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.<lb/>
Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,<lb/>
The victory fell on us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUNCAN</speaker>
<p>Great happiness!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>That now<lb/>
Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:<lb/>
Nor would we deign him burial of his men<lb/>
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch<lb/>
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUNCAN</speaker>
<p>No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive<lb/>
Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,<lb/>
And with his former title greet Macbeth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>I'll see it done.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUNCAN</speaker>
<p>What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.<lb/>

<head>Scene 3</head>

<p><stage>A heath near Forres.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Thunder. Enter the three Witches</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>First Witch</speaker>
<p>Where hast thou been, sister?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Witch</speaker>
<p>Killing swine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Witch</speaker>
<p>Sister, where thou?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Witch</speaker>
<p>A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,<lb/>
And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:&mdash;<lb/>
'Give me,' quoth I:<lb/>
'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.<lb/>
Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:<lb/>
But in a sieve I'll thither sail,<lb/>
And, like a rat without a tail,<lb/>
I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Witch</speaker>
<p>I'll give thee a wind.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Witch</speaker>
<p>Thou'rt kind.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Witch</speaker>
<p>And I another.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Witch</speaker>
<p>I myself have all the other,<lb/>
And the very ports they blow,<lb/>
All the quarters that they know<lb/>
I' the shipman's card.<lb/>
I will drain him dry as hay:<lb/>
Sleep shall neither night nor day<lb/>
Hang upon his pent-house lid;<lb/>
He shall live a man forbid:<lb/>
Weary se'nnights nine times nine<lb/>
Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:<lb/>
Though his bark cannot be lost,<lb/>
Yet it shall be tempest-tost.<lb/>
Look what I have.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Witch</speaker>
<p>Show me, show me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Witch</speaker>
<p>Here I have a pilot's thumb,<lb/>
Wreck'd as homeward he did come.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Drum within</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Witch</speaker>
<p>A drum, a drum!<lb/>
Macbeth doth come.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALL</speaker>
<p>The weird sisters, hand in hand,<lb/>
Posters of the sea and land,<lb/>
Thus do go about, about:<lb/>
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine<lb/>
And thrice again, to make up nine.<lb/>
Peace! the charm's wound up.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter MACBETH and BANQUO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>So foul and fair a day I have not seen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BANQUO</speaker>
<p>How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these<lb/>
So wither'd and so wild in their attire,<lb/>
That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,<lb/>
And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught<lb/>
That man may question? You seem to understand me,<lb/>
By each at once her chappy finger laying<lb/>
Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,<lb/>
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret<lb/>
That you are so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Speak, if you can: what are you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Witch</speaker>
<p>All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Witch</speaker>
<p>All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Witch</speaker>
<p>All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BANQUO</speaker>
<p>Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear<lb/>
Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,<lb/>
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed<lb/>
Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner<lb/>
You greet with present grace and great prediction<lb/>
Of noble having and of royal hope,<lb/>
That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.<lb/>
If you can look into the seeds of time,<lb/>
And say which grain will grow and which will not,<lb/>
Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear<lb/>
Your favours nor your hate.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Witch</speaker>
<p>Hail!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Witch</speaker>
<p>Hail!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Witch</speaker>
<p>Hail!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Witch</speaker>
<p>Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Witch</speaker>
<p>Not so happy, yet much happier.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Witch</speaker>
<p>Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:<lb/>
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Witch</speaker>
<p>Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:<lb/>
By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;<lb/>
But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,<lb/>
A prosperous gentleman; and to be king<lb/>
Stands not within the prospect of belief,<lb/>
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence<lb/>
You owe this strange intelligence? or why<lb/>
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way<lb/>
With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Witches vanish</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BANQUO</speaker>
<p>The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,<lb/>
And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted<lb/>
As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BANQUO</speaker>
<p>Were such things here as we do speak about?<lb/>
Or have we eaten on the insane root<lb/>
That takes the reason prisoner?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Your children shall be kings.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BANQUO</speaker>
<p>You shall be king.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BANQUO</speaker>
<p>To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter ROSS and ANGUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>The king hath happily received, Macbeth,<lb/>
The news of thy success; and when he reads<lb/>
Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,<lb/>
His wonders and his praises do contend<lb/>
Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,<lb/>
In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,<lb/>
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,<lb/>
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,<lb/>
Strange images of death. As thick as hail<lb/>
Came post with post; and every one did bear<lb/>
Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,<lb/>
And pour'd them down before him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANGUS</speaker>
<p>We are sent<lb/>
To give thee from our royal master thanks;<lb/>
Only to herald thee into his sight,<lb/>
Not pay thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>And, for an earnest of a greater honour,<lb/>
He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:<lb/>
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!<lb/>
For it is thine.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BANQUO</speaker>
<p>What, can the devil speak true?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me<lb/>
In borrow'd robes?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANGUS</speaker>
<p>Who was the thane lives yet;<lb/>
But under heavy judgment bears that life<lb/>
Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined<lb/>
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel<lb/>
With hidden help and vantage, or that with both<lb/>
He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;<lb/>
But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,<lb/>
Have overthrown him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!<lb/>
The greatest is behind.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To ROSS and ANGUS</stage></p>


<p>
Thanks for your pains.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To BANQUO</stage></p>


<p>
Do you not hope your children shall be kings,<lb/>
When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me<lb/>
Promised no less to them?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BANQUO</speaker>
<p>That trusted home<lb/>
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,<lb/>
Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:<lb/>
And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,<lb/>
The instruments of darkness tell us truths,<lb/>
Win us with honest trifles, to betray's<lb/>
In deepest consequence.<lb/>
Cousins, a word, I pray you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker><p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p>
<p>Two truths are told,<lb/>
As happy prologues to the swelling act<lb/>
Of the imperial theme.&mdash;I thank you, gentlemen.<lb/>

	</p><p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  This supernatural soliciting<lb/>
Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,<lb/>
Why hath it given me earnest of success,<lb/>
Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:<lb/>
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion<lb/>
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair<lb/>
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,<lb/>
Against the use of nature? Present fears<lb/>
Are less than horrible imaginings:<lb/>
My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,<lb/>
Shakes so my single state of man that function<lb/>
Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is<lb/>
But what is not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BANQUO</speaker>
<p>Look, how our partner's rapt.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,<lb/>
Without my stir.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BANQUO</speaker>
<p>New horrors come upon him,<lb/>
Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould<lb/>
But with the aid of use.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>                Come what come may,<lb/>
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BANQUO</speaker>
<p>Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought<lb/>
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains<lb/>
Are register'd where every day I turn<lb/>
The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.<lb/>
Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,<lb/>
The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak<lb/>
Our free hearts each to other.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BANQUO</speaker>
<p>Very gladly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Till then, enough. Come, friends.<lb/>

</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>

<head>Scene 4</head>

<p><stage>Forres. The palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Flourish. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX,	and Attendants</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>DUNCAN</speaker>
<p>Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not<lb/>
Those in commission yet return'd?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>My liege,<lb/>
They are not yet come back. But I have spoke<lb/>
With one that saw him die: who did report<lb/>
That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,<lb/>
Implored your highness' pardon and set forth<lb/>
A deep repentance: nothing in his life<lb/>
Became him like the leaving it; he died<lb/>
As one that had been studied in his death<lb/>
To throw away the dearest thing he owed,<lb/>
As 'twere a careless trifle.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUNCAN</speaker>
<p>There's no art<lb/>
To find the mind's construction in the face:<lb/>
He was a gentleman on whom I built<lb/>
An absolute trust.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS</stage></p>


<p>
O worthiest cousin!<lb/>
The sin of my ingratitude even now<lb/>
Was heavy on me: thou art so far before<lb/>
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow<lb/>
To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,<lb/>
That the proportion both of thanks and payment<lb/>
Might have been mine! only I have left to say,<lb/>
More is thy due than more than all can pay.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>The service and the loyalty I owe,<lb/>
In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part<lb/>
Is to receive our duties; and our duties<lb/>
Are to your throne and state children and servants,<lb/>
Which do but what they should, by doing every thing<lb/>
Safe toward your love and honour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUNCAN</speaker>
<p>Welcome hither:<lb/>
I have begun to plant thee, and will labour<lb/>
To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,<lb/>
That hast no less deserved, nor must be known<lb/>
No less to have done so, let me enfold thee<lb/>
And hold thee to my heart.<lb/>

<p>There if I grow,<lb/>
The harvest is your own.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUNCAN</speaker>
<p>My plenteous joys,<lb/>
Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves<lb/>
In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,<lb/>
And you whose places are the nearest, know<lb/>
We will establish our estate upon<lb/>
Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter<lb/>
The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must<lb/>
Not unaccompanied invest him only,<lb/>
But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine<lb/>
On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,<lb/>
And bind us further to you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>The rest is labour, which is not used for you:<lb/>
I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful<lb/>
The hearing of my wife with your approach;<lb/>
So humbly take my leave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUNCAN</speaker>
<p>My worthy Cawdor!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step<lb/>
On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,<lb/>
For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;<lb/>
Let not light see my black and deep desires:<lb/>
The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,<lb/>
Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUNCAN</speaker>
<p>True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,<lb/>
And in his commendations I am fed;<lb/>
It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,<lb/>
Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:<lb/>
It is a peerless kinsman.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter LADY MACBETH, reading a letter</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>'They met me in the day of success: and I have<lb/>
learned by the perfectest report, they have more in<lb/>
them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire<lb/>
to question them further, they made themselves air,<lb/>
into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in<lb/>
the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who<lb/>
all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,<lb/>
before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred<lb/>
me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that<lb/>
shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver<lb/>
thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou<lb/>
mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being<lb/>
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it<lb/>
to thy heart, and farewell.'<lb/>
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be<lb/>
What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;<lb/>
It is too full o' the milk of human kindness<lb/>
To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;<lb/>
Art not without ambition, but without<lb/>
The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,<lb/>
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,<lb/>
And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,<lb/>
That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;<lb/>
And that which rather thou dost fear to do<lb/>
Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,<lb/>
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;<lb/>
And chastise with the valour of my tongue<lb/>
All that impedes thee from the golden round,<lb/>
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem<lb/>
To have thee crown'd withal.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Messenger</stage></p>


<p>
What is your tidings?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>The king comes here to-night.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Thou'rt mad to say it:<lb/>
Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,<lb/>
Would have inform'd for preparation.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:<lb/>
One of my fellows had the speed of him,<lb/>
Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more<lb/>
Than would make up his message.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Give him tending;<lb/>
He brings great news.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit Messenger</stage></p>


<p>
The raven himself is hoarse<lb/>
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan<lb/>
Under my battlements. Come, you spirits<lb/>
That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,<lb/>
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full<lb/>
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;<lb/>
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,<lb/>
That no compunctious visitings of nature<lb/>
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between<lb/>
The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,<lb/>
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,<lb/>
Wherever in your sightless substances<lb/>
You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,<lb/>
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,<lb/>
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,<lb/>
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,<lb/>
To cry 'Hold, hold!'<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter MACBETH</stage></p>


<p>
Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!<lb/>
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!<lb/>
Thy letters have transported me beyond<lb/>
This ignorant present, and I feel now<lb/>
The future in the instant.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>

Duncan comes here to-night.<lb/>

<p>To-morrow, as he purposes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>O, never<lb/>
Shall sun that morrow see!<lb/>
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men<lb/>
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,<lb/>
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,<lb/>
Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,<lb/>
But be the serpent under't. He that's coming<lb/>
Must be provided for: and you shall put<lb/>
This night's great business into my dispatch;<lb/>
Which shall to all our nights and days to come<lb/>
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>

</p><sp><speaker>DUNCAN</speaker>
<p>This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air<lb/>
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself<lb/>
Unto our gentle senses.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BANQUO</speaker>
<p>This guest of summer,<lb/>
The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,<lb/>
By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath<lb/>
Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,<lb/>
Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird<lb/>
Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:<lb/>
Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,<lb/>
The air is delicate.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter LADY MACBETH</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUNCAN</speaker>
<p>See, see, our honour'd hostess!<lb/>
The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,<lb/>
Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you<lb/>
How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,<lb/>
And thank us for your trouble.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>All our service<lb/>
In every point twice done and then done double<lb/>
Were poor and single business to contend<lb/>
Against those honours deep and broad wherewith<lb/>
Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,<lb/>
And the late dignities heap'd up to them,<lb/>
We rest your hermits.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUNCAN</speaker>
<p>Where's the thane of Cawdor?<lb/>
We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose<lb/>
To be his purveyor: but he rides well;<lb/>
And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him<lb/>
To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,<lb/>
We are your guest to-night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Your servants ever<lb/>
Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,<lb/>
To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,<lb/>
Still to return your own.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DUNCAN</speaker>

</p><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well<lb/>
It were done quickly: if the assassination<lb/>
Could trammel up the consequence, and catch<lb/>
With his surcease success; that but this blow<lb/>
Might be the be-all and the end-all here,<lb/>
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,<lb/>
We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases<lb/>
We still have judgment here; that we but teach<lb/>
Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return<lb/>
To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice<lb/>
Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice<lb/>
To our own lips. He's here in double trust;<lb/>
First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,<lb/>
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,<lb/>
Who should against his murderer shut the door,<lb/>
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan<lb/>
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been<lb/>
So clear in his great office, that his virtues<lb/>
Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against<lb/>
The deep damnation of his taking-off;<lb/>
And pity, like a naked new-born babe,<lb/>
Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed<lb/>
Upon the sightless couriers of the air,<lb/>
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,<lb/>
That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur<lb/>
To prick the sides of my intent, but only<lb/>
Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself<lb/>
And falls on the other.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter LADY MACBETH</stage></p>


<p>
How now! what news?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Hath he ask'd for me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Know you not he has?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>We will proceed no further in this business:<lb/>
He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought<lb/>
Golden opinions from all sorts of people,<lb/>
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,<lb/>
Not cast aside so soon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Was the hope drunk<lb/>
Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?<lb/>
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale<lb/>
At what it did so freely? From this time<lb/>
Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard<lb/>
To be the same in thine own act and valour<lb/>
As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that<lb/>
Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,<lb/>
And live a coward in thine own esteem,<lb/>
Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'<lb/>
Like the poor cat i' the adage?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Prithee, peace:<lb/>
I dare do all that may become a man;<lb/>
Who dares do more is none.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>What beast was't, then,<lb/>
That made you break this enterprise to me?<lb/>
When you durst do it, then you were a man;<lb/>
And, to be more than what you were, you would<lb/>
Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place<lb/>
Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:<lb/>
They have made themselves, and that their fitness now<lb/>
Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know<lb/>
How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:<lb/>
I would, while it was smiling in my face,<lb/>
Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,<lb/>
And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you<lb/>
Have done to this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>If we should fail?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>We fail!<lb/>
But screw your courage to the sticking-place,<lb/>
And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep&mdash;<lb/>
Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey<lb/>
Soundly invite him&mdash;his two chamberlains<lb/>
Will I with wine and wassail so convince<lb/>
That memory, the warder of the brain,<lb/>
Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason<lb/>
A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep<lb/>
Their drenched natures lie as in a death,<lb/>
What cannot you and I perform upon<lb/>
The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon<lb/>
His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt<lb/>
Of our great quell?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Bring forth men-children only;<lb/>
For thy undaunted mettle should compose<lb/>
Nothing but males. Will it not be received,<lb/>
When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two<lb/>
Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,<lb/>
That they have done't?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Who dares receive it other,<lb/>
As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar<lb/>
Upon his death?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>I am settled, and bend up<lb/>
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.<lb/>
Away, and mock the time with fairest show:<lb/>
False face must hide what the false heart doth know.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BANQUO</speaker>
<p>What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:<lb/>
He hath been in unusual pleasure, and<lb/>
Sent forth great largess to your offices.<lb/>

In measureless content.<lb/>

I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:<lb/>
To you they have show'd some truth.<lb/>

Is this a dagger which I see before me,<lb/>
The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.<lb/>
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.<lb/>
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible<lb/>
To feeling as to sight? or art thou but<lb/>
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,<lb/>
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?<lb/>
I see thee yet, in form as palpable<lb/>
As this which now I draw.<lb/>
Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;<lb/>
And such an instrument I was to use.<lb/>
Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,<lb/>
Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,<lb/>
And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,<lb/>
Which was not so before. There's no such thing:<lb/>
It is the bloody business which informs<lb/>
Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld<lb/>
Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse<lb/>
The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates<lb/>
Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,<lb/>
Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,<lb/>
Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.<lb/>
With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design<lb/>
Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,<lb/>
Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear<lb/>
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,<lb/>
And take the present horror from the time,<lb/>
Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:<lb/>
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.<lb/>

It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried<lb/>
'Murder!'<lb/>
That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:<lb/>
But they did say their prayers, and address'd them<lb/>
Again to sleep.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>There are two lodged together.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;<lb/>
As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.<lb/>
Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'<lb/>
When they did say 'God bless us!'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Consider it not so deeply.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?<lb/>
I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'<lb/>
Stuck in my throat.<lb/>

<p>These deeds must not be thought<lb/>
After these ways; so, it will make us mad.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!<lb/>
Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,<lb/>
Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,<lb/>
The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,<lb/>
Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,<lb/>
Chief nourisher in life's feast,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>What do you mean?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:<lb/>
'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor<lb/>
Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,<lb/>
You do unbend your noble strength, to think<lb/>
So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,<lb/>
And wash this filthy witness from your hand.<lb/>
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?<lb/>
They must lie there: go carry them; and smear<lb/>
The sleepy grooms with blood.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>I'll go no more:<lb/>
I am afraid to think what I have done;<lb/>
Look on't again I dare not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Infirm of purpose!<lb/>
Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead<lb/>
Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood<lb/>
That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,<lb/>
I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;<lb/>
For it must seem their guilt.<lb/>

<p>Here's a knocking indeed! If a<lb/>
man were porter of hell-gate, he should have<lb/>
old turning the key.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Knocking within</stage></p>


<p>
Knock,<lb/>
knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of<lb/>
Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged<lb/>
himself on the expectation of plenty: come in<lb/>
time; have napkins enow about you; here<lb/>
you'll sweat for't.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Knocking within</stage></p>


<p>
Knock,<lb/>
knock! Who's there, in the other devil's<lb/>
name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could<lb/>
swear in both the scales against either scale;<lb/>
who committed treason enough for God's sake,<lb/>
yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come<lb/>
in, equivocator.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Knocking within</stage></p>


<p>
Knock,<lb/>
knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an<lb/>
English tailor come hither, for stealing out of<lb/>
a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may<lb/>
roast your goose.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Knocking within</stage></p>


<p>
Knock,<lb/>
knock; never at quiet! What are you? But<lb/>
this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter<lb/>
it no further: I had thought to have let in<lb/>
some of all professions that go the primrose<lb/>
way to the everlasting bonfire.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Knocking within</stage></p>


<p>
Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Opens the gate</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,<lb/>
That you do lie so late?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Porter</speaker>
<p>'Faith sir, we were carousing till the<lb/>
second cock: and drink, sir, is a great<lb/>
provoker of three things.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>What three things does drink especially provoke?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Porter</speaker>
<p>Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and<lb/>
urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;<lb/>
it provokes the desire, but it takes<lb/>
away the performance: therefore, much drink<lb/>
may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:<lb/>
it makes him, and it mars him; it sets<lb/>
him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,<lb/>
and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and<lb/>
not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him<lb/>
in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Porter</speaker>
<p>That it did, sir, i' the very throat on<lb/>
me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I<lb/>
think, being too strong for him, though he took<lb/>
up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast<lb/>
him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Is thy master stirring?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter MACBETH</stage></p>


<p>
Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LENNOX</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, noble sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, both.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Is the king stirring, worthy thane?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Not yet.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>He did command me to call timely on him:<lb/>
I have almost slipp'd the hour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>I'll bring you to him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>I know this is a joyful trouble to you;<lb/>
But yet 'tis one.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>The labour we delight in physics pain.<lb/>
This is the door.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>He does: he did appoint so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LENNOX</speaker>
<p>The night has been unruly: where we lay,<lb/>
Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,<lb/>
Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,<lb/>
And prophesying with accents terrible<lb/>
Of dire combustion and confused events<lb/>
New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird<lb/>
Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth<lb/>
Was feverous and did shake.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>'Twas a rough night.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LENNOX</speaker>
<p>My young remembrance cannot parallel<lb/>
A fellow to it.<lb/>

<p>What's the matter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!<lb/>
Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope<lb/>
The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence<lb/>
The life o' the building!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>What is 't you say? the life?<lb/>

Awake, awake!<lb/>
Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!<lb/>
Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!<lb/>
Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,<lb/>
And look on death itself! up, up, and see<lb/>
The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!<lb/>
As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,<lb/>
To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.<lb/>

That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley<lb/>
The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>O gentle lady,<lb/>
'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:<lb/>

Would murder as it fell.<lb/>

<p>
O Banquo, Banquo,<lb/>
Our royal master 's murder'd!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Woe, alas!<lb/>
What, in our house?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BANQUO</speaker>
<p>Too cruel any where.<lb/>
Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,<lb/>
And say it is not so.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter MACBETH and LENNOX, with ROSS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Had I but died an hour before this chance,<lb/>
I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,<lb/>
There 's nothing serious in mortality:<lb/>
All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;<lb/>
The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees<lb/>
Is left this vault to brag of.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter MALCOLM and DONALBAIN</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DONALBAIN</speaker>
<p>What is amiss?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>You are, and do not know't:<lb/>
The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood<lb/>
Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Your royal father 's murder'd.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>O, by whom?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LENNOX</speaker>
<p>Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:<lb/>
Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;<lb/>
So were their daggers, which unwiped we found<lb/>
Upon their pillows:<lb/>
They stared, and were distracted; no man's life<lb/>
Was to be trusted with them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>O, yet I do repent me of my fury,<lb/>
That I did kill them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Wherefore did you so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,<lb/>
Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:<lb/>
The expedition my violent love<lb/>
Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,<lb/>
His silver skin laced with his golden blood;<lb/>
And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature<lb/>
For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,<lb/>
Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers<lb/>
Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,<lb/>
That had a heart to love, and in that heart<lb/>
Courage to make 's love known?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Help me hence, ho!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Look to the lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to DONALBAIN]</stage></p><p>  Why do we hold our tongues,<lb/>
That most may claim this argument for ours?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DONALBAIN</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to MALCOLM]</stage></p><p>  What should be spoken here,<lb/>
where our fate,<lb/>
Hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us?<lb/>

Our tears are not yet brew'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to DONALBAIN]</stage></p><p>        Nor our strong sorrow<lb/>
Upon the foot of motion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BANQUO</speaker>
<p>Look to the lady:<lb/>

</p><p><stage>LADY MACBETH is carried out</stage></p>


<p>
And when we have our naked frailties hid,<lb/>
That suffer in exposure, let us meet,<lb/>
And question this most bloody piece of work,<lb/>
To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:<lb/>
In the great hand of God I stand; and thence<lb/>
Against the undivulged pretence I fight<lb/>
Of treasonous malice.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>And so do I.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALL</speaker>
<p>So all.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Let's briefly put on manly readiness,<lb/>

<p>Well contented.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>Old Man</speaker>
<p>Threescore and ten I can remember well:<lb/>
Within the volume of which time I have seen<lb/>
Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night<lb/>
Hath trifled former knowings.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>Ah, good father,<lb/>
Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,<lb/>
Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,<lb/>
And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:<lb/>
Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,<lb/>
That darkness does the face of earth entomb,<lb/>
When living light should kiss it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Old Man</speaker>
<p>'Tis unnatural,<lb/>
Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last,<lb/>
A falcon, towering in her pride of place,<lb/>
Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>And Duncan's horses&mdash;a thing most strange and certain&mdash;<lb/>
Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,<lb/>
Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,<lb/>
Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make<lb/>
War with mankind.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Old Man</speaker>
<p>'Tis said they eat each other.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes<lb/>
That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter MACDUFF</stage></p>


<p>
How goes the world, sir, now?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Why, see you not?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Those that Macbeth hath slain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>Alas, the day!<lb/>
What good could they pretend?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>They were suborn'd:<lb/>
Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,<lb/>
Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them<lb/>
Suspicion of the deed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>'Gainst nature still!<lb/>
Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up<lb/>
Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like<lb/>
The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>

It should not stand in thy posterity,<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BANQUO</speaker>
<p>Ay, my good lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>We should have else desired your good advice,<lb/>

To be thus is nothing;<lb/>
But to be safely thus.&mdash;Our fears in Banquo<lb/>
Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature<lb/>
Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;<lb/>
And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,<lb/>
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour<lb/>
To act in safety. There is none but he<lb/>
Whose being I do fear: and, under him,<lb/>
My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,<lb/>
Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters<lb/>
When first they put the name of king upon me,<lb/>
And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like<lb/>
They hail'd him father to a line of kings:<lb/>
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,<lb/>
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,<lb/>
Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,<lb/>
No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,<lb/>
For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;<lb/>
For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;<lb/>
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace<lb/>
Only for them; and mine eternal jewel<lb/>
Given to the common enemy of man,<lb/>
To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!<lb/>
Rather than so, come fate into the list.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>It was, so please your highness.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Well then, now<lb/>
Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know<lb/>
That it was he in the times past which held you<lb/>
So under fortune, which you thought had been<lb/>
Our innocent self: this I made good to you<lb/>
In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,<lb/>
How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,<lb/>
the instruments,<lb/>
Who wrought with them, and all things else that might<lb/>
To half a soul and to a notion crazed<lb/>
Say 'Thus did Banquo.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>You made it known to us.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>I did so, and went further, which is now<lb/>
Our point of second meeting. Do you find<lb/>
Your patience so predominant in your nature<lb/>
That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd<lb/>
To pray for this good man and for his issue,<lb/>
Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave<lb/>
And beggar'd yours for ever?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>We are men, my liege.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;<lb/>
As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,<lb/>
Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept<lb/>
All by the name of dogs: the valued file<lb/>
Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,<lb/>
The housekeeper, the hunter, every one<lb/>
According to the gift which bounteous nature<lb/>
Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive<lb/>
Particular addition. from the bill<lb/>
That writes them all alike: and so of men.<lb/>
Now, if you have a station in the file,<lb/>
Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;<lb/>
And I will put that business in your bosoms,<lb/>
Whose execution takes your enemy off,<lb/>
Grapples you to the heart and love of us,<lb/>
Who wear our health but sickly in his life,<lb/>
Which in his death were perfect.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>I am one, my liege,<lb/>
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world<lb/>
Have so incensed that I am reckless what<lb/>
I do to spite the world.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>And I another<lb/>
So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,<lb/>
That I would set my lie on any chance,<lb/>
To mend it, or be rid on't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Both of you<lb/>
Know Banquo was your enemy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Both Murderers</speaker>
<p>True, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,<lb/>
That every minute of his being thrusts<lb/>
Against my near'st of life: and though I could<lb/>
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight<lb/>
And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,<lb/>
For certain friends that are both his and mine,<lb/>
Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall<lb/>
Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,<lb/>
That I to your assistance do make love,<lb/>
Masking the business from the common eye<lb/>
For sundry weighty reasons.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Murderer</speaker>
<p>We shall, my lord,<lb/>
Perform what you command us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Though our lives&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most<lb/>
I will advise you where to plant yourselves;<lb/>
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,<lb/>
The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,<lb/>
And something from the palace; always thought<lb/>
That I require a clearness: and with him&mdash;<lb/>
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work&mdash;<lb/>
Fleance his son, that keeps him company,<lb/>
Whose absence is no less material to me<lb/>
Than is his father's, must embrace the fate<lb/>
Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:<lb/>
I'll come to you anon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Both Murderers</speaker>
<p>We are resolved, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>I'll call upon you straight: abide within.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt Murderers</stage></p>


<p>
It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,<lb/>
If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.<lb/>

<p>Is Banquo gone from court?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Say to the king, I would attend his leisure<lb/>
For a few words.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Madam, I will.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Nought's had, all's spent,<lb/>
Where our desire is got without content:<lb/>
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy<lb/>
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter MACBETH</stage></p>


<p>
How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,<lb/>
Of sorriest fancies your companions making,<lb/>
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died<lb/>
With them they think on? Things without all remedy<lb/>
Should be without regard: what's done is done.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:<lb/>
She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice<lb/>
Remains in danger of her former tooth.<lb/>
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the<lb/>
worlds suffer,<lb/>
Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep<lb/>
In the affliction of these terrible dreams<lb/>
That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,<lb/>
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,<lb/>
Than on the torture of the mind to lie<lb/>
In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;<lb/>
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;<lb/>
Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,<lb/>
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,<lb/>
Can touch him further.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Come on;<lb/>
Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;<lb/>
Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:<lb/>
Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;<lb/>
Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:<lb/>
Unsafe the while, that we<lb/>
Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,<lb/>
And make our faces vizards to our hearts,<lb/>
Disguising what they are.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>You must leave this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!<lb/>
Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>But in them nature's copy's not eterne.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>There's comfort yet; they are assailable;<lb/>
Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown<lb/>
His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons<lb/>
The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums<lb/>
Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done<lb/>
A deed of dreadful note.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>What's to be done?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,<lb/>
Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,<lb/>
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;<lb/>
And with thy bloody and invisible hand<lb/>
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond<lb/>
Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow<lb/>
Makes wing to the rooky wood:<lb/>
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;<lb/>
While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.<lb/>
Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;<lb/>
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.<lb/>
So, prithee, go with me.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>You know your own degrees; sit down: at first<lb/>
And last the hearty welcome.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lords</speaker>
<p>Thanks to your majesty.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Ourself will mingle with society,<lb/>
And play the humble host.<lb/>
Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time<lb/>
We will require her welcome.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;<lb/>
For my heart speaks they are welcome.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>First Murderer appears at the door</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.<lb/>
Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:<lb/>
Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure<lb/>
The table round.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Approaching the door</stage></p>


<p>
There's blood on thy face.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>'Tis Banquo's then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>'Tis better thee without than he within.<lb/>
Is he dispatch'd?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good<lb/>
That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,<lb/>
Thou art the nonpareil.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Most royal sir,<lb/>
Fleance is 'scaped.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,<lb/>
Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,<lb/>
As broad and general as the casing air:<lb/>
But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in<lb/>
To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Murderer</speaker>
<p>Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,<lb/>
With twenty trenched gashes on his head;<lb/>
The least a death to nature.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Thanks for that:<lb/>
There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled<lb/>
Hath nature that in time will venom breed,<lb/>
No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow<lb/>
We'll hear, ourselves, again.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit Murderer</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>My royal lord,<lb/>
You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold<lb/>
That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,<lb/>
'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;<lb/>
From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;<lb/>
Meeting were bare without it.<lb/>

<p>Sweet remembrancer!<lb/>
Now, good digestion wait on appetite,<lb/>

Who may I rather challenge for unkindness<lb/>
Than pity for mischance!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>

Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness<lb/>
To grace us with your royal company.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LENNOX</speaker>
<p>Here is a place reserved, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Where?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LENNOX</speaker>
<p>Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Which of you have done this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lords</speaker>
<p>What, my good lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Thou canst not say I did it: never shake<lb/>
Thy gory locks at me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,<lb/>
And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;<lb/>
The fit is momentary; upon a thought<lb/>
He will again be well: if much you note him,<lb/>
You shall offend him and extend his passion:<lb/>
Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that<lb/>
Which might appal the devil.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>O proper stuff!<lb/>
This is the very painting of your fear:<lb/>
This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,<lb/>
Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,<lb/>
Impostors to true fear, would well become<lb/>
A woman's story at a winter's fire,<lb/>
Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!<lb/>
Why do you make such faces? When all's done,<lb/>
You look but on a stool.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!<lb/>
how say you?<lb/>
Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.<lb/>
If charnel-houses and our graves must send<lb/>
Those that we bury back, our monuments<lb/>
Shall be the maws of kites.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>If I stand here, I saw him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Fie, for shame!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,<lb/>
Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;<lb/>
Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd<lb/>
Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,<lb/>
That, when the brains were out, the man would die,<lb/>
And there an end; but now they rise again,<lb/>
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,<lb/>
And push us from our stools: this is more strange<lb/>
Than such a murder is.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>My worthy lord,<lb/>
Your noble friends do lack you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>I do forget.<lb/>
Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,<lb/>
I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing<lb/>
To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;<lb/>
Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.<lb/>
I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,<lb/>
And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;<lb/>
Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,<lb/>
And all to all.<lb/>

Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;<lb/>
Thou hast no speculation in those eyes<lb/>
Which thou dost glare with!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Think of this, good peers,<lb/>
But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;<lb/>
Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>What man dare, I dare:<lb/>
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,<lb/>
The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;<lb/>
Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves<lb/>
Shall never tremble: or be alive again,<lb/>
And dare me to the desert with thy sword;<lb/>
If trembling I inhabit then, protest me<lb/>
The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!<lb/>
Unreal mockery, hence!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes</stage></p>


<p>
Why, so: being gone,<lb/>
I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,<lb/>
With most admired disorder.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Can such things be,<lb/>
And overcome us like a summer's cloud,<lb/>
Without our special wonder? You make me strange<lb/>
Even to the disposition that I owe,<lb/>
When now I think you can behold such sights,<lb/>
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,<lb/>
When mine is blanched with fear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>What sights, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;<lb/>
Question enrages him. At once, good night:<lb/>
Stand not upon the order of your going,<lb/>
But go at once.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LENNOX</speaker>
<p>Good night; and better health<lb/>
Attend his majesty!<lb/>

<p>It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:<lb/>
Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;<lb/>
Augurs and understood relations have<lb/>
By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth<lb/>
The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Almost at odds with morning, which is which.<lb/>

<p>How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person<lb/>
At our great bidding?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Did you send to him, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>I hear it by the way; but I will send:<lb/>
There's not a one of them but in his house<lb/>
I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,<lb/>
And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:<lb/>
More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,<lb/>
By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,<lb/>
All causes shall give way: I am in blood<lb/>
Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,<lb/>
Returning were as tedious as go o'er:<lb/>
Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;<lb/>
Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>You lack the season of all natures, sleep.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>

In riddles and affairs of death;<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter LENNOX and another Lord</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>LENNOX</speaker>
<p>My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,<lb/>
Which can interpret further: only, I say,<lb/>
Things have been strangely borne. The<lb/>
gracious Duncan<lb/>
Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:<lb/>
And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;<lb/>
Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,<lb/>
For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.<lb/>
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous<lb/>
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain<lb/>
To kill their gracious father? damned fact!<lb/>
How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight<lb/>
In pious rage the two delinquents tear,<lb/>
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?<lb/>
Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;<lb/>
For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive<lb/>
To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,<lb/>
He has borne all things well: and I do think<lb/>
That had he Duncan's sons under his key&mdash;<lb/>
As, an't please heaven, he shall not&mdash;they<lb/>
should find<lb/>
What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.<lb/>
But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd<lb/>
His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear<lb/>
Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell<lb/>
Where he bestows himself?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord</speaker>
<p>The son of Duncan,<lb/>
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth<lb/>
Lives in the English court, and is received<lb/>
Of the most pious Edward with such grace<lb/>
That the malevolence of fortune nothing<lb/>
Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff<lb/>
Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid<lb/>
To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:<lb/>
That, by the help of these&mdash;with Him above<lb/>
To ratify the work&mdash;we may again<lb/>
Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,<lb/>
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,<lb/>
Do faithful homage and receive free honours:<lb/>
All which we pine for now: and this report<lb/>
Hath so exasperate the king that he<lb/>
Prepares for some attempt of war.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LENNOX</speaker>
<p>Sent he to Macduff?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord</speaker>
<p>He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'<lb/>
The cloudy messenger turns me his back,<lb/>
And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time<lb/>
That clogs me with this answer.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LENNOX</speaker>
<p>And that well might<lb/>
Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance<lb/>
His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel<lb/>
Fly to the court of England and unfold<lb/>
His message ere he come, that a swift blessing<lb/>
May soon return to this our suffering country<lb/>
Under a hand accursed!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord</speaker>

<p>How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!<lb/>
What is't you do?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALL</speaker>
<p>A deed without a name.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>I conjure you, by that which you profess,<lb/>
Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:<lb/>
Though you untie the winds and let them fight<lb/>
Against the churches; though the yesty waves<lb/>
Confound and swallow navigation up;<lb/>
Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;<lb/>
Though castles topple on their warders' heads;<lb/>
Though palaces and pyramids do slope<lb/>
Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure<lb/>

<p>Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,<lb/>
Or from our masters?<lb/>

<p>Call 'em; let me see 'em.<lb/>

Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten<lb/>
From the murderer's gibbet throw<lb/>
Into the flame.<lb/>

<p>He knows thy thought:<lb/>
Hear his speech, but say thou nought.<lb/>

Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;<lb/>
Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one<lb/>
word more,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Witch</speaker>
<p>He will not be commanded: here's another,<lb/>
More potent than the first.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Thunder. Second Apparition: A bloody Child</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Apparition</speaker>
<p>Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Apparition</speaker>
<p>Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn<lb/>
The power of man, for none of woman born<lb/>
Shall harm Macbeth.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Descends</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?<lb/>
But yet I'll make assurance double sure,<lb/>
And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;<lb/>
That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,<lb/>
And sleep in spite of thunder.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned,	with a tree in his hand</stage></p>

What is this<lb/>
That rises like the issue of a king,<lb/>
And wears upon his baby-brow the round<lb/>
And top of sovereignty?<lb/>

<p>Listen, but speak not to't.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Apparition</speaker>
<p>Be lion-mettled, proud; and take no care<lb/>
Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:<lb/>
Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until<lb/>
Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill<lb/>
Shall come against him.<lb/>

Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood<lb/>
Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth<lb/>
Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath<lb/>
To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart<lb/>
Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art<lb/>
Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever<lb/>
Reign in this kingdom?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALL</speaker>
<p>Seek to know no more.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>

<p>Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!<lb/>
Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,<lb/>
Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.<lb/>
A third is like the former. Filthy hags!<lb/>
Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!<lb/>
What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?<lb/>
Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more:<lb/>
And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass<lb/>
Which shows me many more; and some I see<lb/>
That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:<lb/>
Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true;<lb/>
For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,<lb/>
And points at them for his.<lb/>

<p>
What, is this so?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Witch</speaker>
<p>Ay, sir, all this is so: but why<lb/>
Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?<lb/>
Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,<lb/>
And show the best of our delights:<lb/>
I'll charm the air to give a sound,<lb/>
While you perform your antic round:<lb/>
That this great king may kindly say,<lb/>
Our duties did his welcome pay.<lb/>

<p>No, my lord.<lb/>

<p>No, indeed, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Infected be the air whereon they ride;<lb/>
And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear<lb/>
The galloping of horse: who was't came by?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LENNOX</speaker>
<p>'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word<lb/>
Macduff is fled to England.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LENNOX</speaker>
<p>Ay, my good lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:<lb/>
The flighty purpose never is o'ertook<lb/>
Unless the deed go with it; from this moment<lb/>
The very firstlings of my heart shall be<lb/>
The firstlings of my hand. And even now,<lb/>
To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:<lb/>
The castle of Macduff I will surprise;<lb/>
Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword<lb/>
His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls<lb/>
That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;<lb/>
This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.<lb/>
But no more sights!&mdash;Where are these gentlemen?<lb/>
Come, bring me where they are.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>LADY MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>What had he done, to make him fly the land?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>You must have patience, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>He had none:<lb/>
His flight was madness: when our actions do not,<lb/>
Our fears do make us traitors.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>You know not<lb/>
Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,<lb/>
His mansion and his titles in a place<lb/>
From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;<lb/>
He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,<lb/>
The most diminutive of birds, will fight,<lb/>
Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.<lb/>
All is the fear and nothing is the love;<lb/>
As little is the wisdom, where the flight<lb/>
So runs against all reason.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>My dearest coz,<lb/>
I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,<lb/>
He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows<lb/>
The fits o' the season. I dare not speak<lb/>
much further;<lb/>
But cruel are the times, when we are traitors<lb/>
And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour<lb/>
From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,<lb/>
But float upon a wild and violent sea<lb/>
Each way and move. I take my leave of you:<lb/>
Shall not be long but I'll be here again:<lb/>
Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward<lb/>
To what they were before. My pretty cousin,<lb/>
Blessing upon you!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,<lb/>
It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:<lb/>
I take my leave at once.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Sirrah, your father's dead;<lb/>
And what will you do now? How will you live?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Son</speaker>
<p>As birds do, mother.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>What, with worms and flies?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Son</speaker>
<p>With what I get, I mean; and so do they.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,<lb/>
The pitfall nor the gin.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Son</speaker>
<p>Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.<lb/>
My father is not dead, for all your saying.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Son</speaker>
<p>Nay, how will you do for a husband?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Son</speaker>
<p>Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,<lb/>
With wit enough for thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Son</speaker>
<p>Was my father a traitor, mother?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Ay, that he was.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Son</speaker>
<p>What is a traitor?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Why, one that swears and lies.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Son</speaker>
<p>And be all traitors that do so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Son</speaker>
<p>And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Every one.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Son</speaker>
<p>Who must hang them?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Why, the honest men.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Son</speaker>
<p>Then the liars and swearers are fools,<lb/>
for there are liars and swearers enow to beat<lb/>
the honest men and hang up them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Now, God help thee, poor monkey!<lb/>
But how wilt thou do for a father?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Son</speaker>
<p>If he were dead, you'ld weep for<lb/>
him: if you would not, it were a good sign<lb/>
that I should quickly have a new father.<lb/>

Though in your state of honour I am perfect.<lb/>
I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:<lb/>
If you will take a homely man's advice,<lb/>
Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.<lb/>
To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;<lb/>
To do worse to you were fell cruelty,<lb/>
Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!<lb/>

I am in this earthly world; where to do harm<lb/>
Is often laudable, to do good sometime<lb/>
Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,<lb/>
Do I put up that womanly defence,<lb/>
To say I have done no harm?<lb/>

<p><stage>England. Before the King's palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFF</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there<lb/>
Weep our sad bosoms empty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Let us rather<lb/>
Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men<lb/>
Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn<lb/>
New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows<lb/>
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds<lb/>
As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out<lb/>
Like syllable of dolour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>What I believe I'll wail,<lb/>
What know believe, and what I can redress,<lb/>
As I shall find the time to friend, I will.<lb/>
What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.<lb/>
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,<lb/>
Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.<lb/>
He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;<lb/>
but something<lb/>
You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom<lb/>
To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb<lb/>
To appease an angry god.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>I am not treacherous.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>But Macbeth is.<lb/>
A good and virtuous nature may recoil<lb/>
In an imperial charge. But I shall crave<lb/>
your pardon;<lb/>
That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:<lb/>
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;<lb/>
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,<lb/>
Yet grace must still look so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>I have lost my hopes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.<lb/>
Why in that rawness left you wife and child,<lb/>
Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,<lb/>
Without leave-taking? I pray you,<lb/>
Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,<lb/>
But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,<lb/>
Whatever I shall think.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Bleed, bleed, poor country!<lb/>
Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,<lb/>
For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou<lb/>
thy wrongs;<lb/>
The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:<lb/>
I would not be the villain that thou think'st<lb/>
For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,<lb/>
And the rich East to boot.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>Be not offended:<lb/>
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.<lb/>
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;<lb/>
It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash<lb/>
Is added to her wounds: I think withal<lb/>
There would be hands uplifted in my right;<lb/>
And here from gracious England have I offer<lb/>
Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,<lb/>
When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,<lb/>
Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country<lb/>
Shall have more vices than it had before,<lb/>
More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,<lb/>
By him that shall succeed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>What should he be?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>It is myself I mean: in whom I know<lb/>
All the particulars of vice so grafted<lb/>
That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth<lb/>
Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state<lb/>
Esteem him as a lamb, being compared<lb/>
With my confineless harms.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Not in the legions<lb/>
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd<lb/>
In evils to top Macbeth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>I grant him bloody,<lb/>
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,<lb/>
Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin<lb/>
That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,<lb/>
In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,<lb/>
Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up<lb/>
The cistern of my lust, and my desire<lb/>
All continent impediments would o'erbear<lb/>
That did oppose my will: better Macbeth<lb/>
Than such an one to reign.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Boundless intemperance<lb/>
In nature is a tyranny; it hath been<lb/>
The untimely emptying of the happy throne<lb/>
And fall of many kings. But fear not yet<lb/>
To take upon you what is yours: you may<lb/>
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,<lb/>
And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.<lb/>
We have willing dames enough: there cannot be<lb/>
That vulture in you, to devour so many<lb/>
As will to greatness dedicate themselves,<lb/>
Finding it so inclined.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>With this there grows<lb/>
In my most ill-composed affection such<lb/>
A stanchless avarice that, were I king,<lb/>
I should cut off the nobles for their lands,<lb/>
Desire his jewels and this other's house:<lb/>
And my more-having would be as a sauce<lb/>
To make me hunger more; that I should forge<lb/>
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,<lb/>
Destroying them for wealth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>This avarice<lb/>
Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root<lb/>
Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been<lb/>
The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;<lb/>
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.<lb/>
Of your mere own: all these are portable,<lb/>
With other graces weigh'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>But I have none: the king-becoming graces,<lb/>
As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,<lb/>
Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,<lb/>
Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,<lb/>
I have no relish of them, but abound<lb/>
In the division of each several crime,<lb/>
Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should<lb/>
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,<lb/>
Uproar the universal peace, confound<lb/>
All unity on earth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>O Scotland, Scotland!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>If such a one be fit to govern, speak:<lb/>
I am as I have spoken.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Fit to govern!<lb/>
No, not to live. O nation miserable,<lb/>
With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,<lb/>
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,<lb/>
Since that the truest issue of thy throne<lb/>
By his own interdiction stands accursed,<lb/>
And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father<lb/>
Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,<lb/>
Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,<lb/>
Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!<lb/>
These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself<lb/>
Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,<lb/>
Thy hope ends here!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>Macduff, this noble passion,<lb/>
Child of integrity, hath from my soul<lb/>
Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts<lb/>
To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth<lb/>
By many of these trains hath sought to win me<lb/>
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me<lb/>
From over-credulous haste: but God above<lb/>
Deal between thee and me! for even now<lb/>
I put myself to thy direction, and<lb/>
Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure<lb/>
The taints and blames I laid upon myself,<lb/>
For strangers to my nature. I am yet<lb/>
Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,<lb/>
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,<lb/>
At no time broke my faith, would not betray<lb/>
The devil to his fellow and delight<lb/>
No less in truth than life: my first false speaking<lb/>
Was this upon myself: what I am truly,<lb/>
Is thine and my poor country's to command:<lb/>
Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,<lb/>
Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,<lb/>
Already at a point, was setting forth.<lb/>
Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness<lb/>
Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Such welcome and unwelcome things at once<lb/>
'Tis hard to reconcile.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Doctor</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>Well; more anon.&mdash;Comes the king forth, I pray you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Doctor</speaker>
<p>Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls<lb/>
That stay his cure: their malady convinces<lb/>
The great assay of art; but at his touch&mdash;<lb/>
Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand&mdash;<lb/>
They presently amend.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit Doctor</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>What's the disease he means?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>'Tis call'd the evil:<lb/>
A most miraculous work in this good king;<lb/>
Which often, since my here-remain in England,<lb/>
I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,<lb/>
Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,<lb/>
All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,<lb/>
The mere despair of surgery, he cures,<lb/>
Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,<lb/>
Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,<lb/>
To the succeeding royalty he leaves<lb/>
The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,<lb/>
He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,<lb/>
And sundry blessings hang about his throne,<lb/>
That speak him full of grace.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter ROSS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>See, who comes here?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>My countryman; but yet I know him not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>I know him now. Good God, betimes remove<lb/>
The means that makes us strangers!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>Sir, amen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Stands Scotland where it did?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>Alas, poor country!<lb/>
Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot<lb/>
Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,<lb/>
But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;<lb/>
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air<lb/>
Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems<lb/>
A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell<lb/>
Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives<lb/>
Expire before the flowers in their caps,<lb/>
Dying or ere they sicken.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>O, relation<lb/>
Too nice, and yet too true!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>What's the newest grief?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:<lb/>
Each minute teems a new one.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>How does my wife?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>Why, well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>And all my children?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>Well too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>When I came hither to transport the tidings,<lb/>
Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour<lb/>
Of many worthy fellows that were out;<lb/>
Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,<lb/>
For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:<lb/>
Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland<lb/>
Would create soldiers, make our women fight,<lb/>
To doff their dire distresses.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>Be't their comfort<lb/>
We are coming thither: gracious England hath<lb/>
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;<lb/>
An older and a better soldier none<lb/>
That Christendom gives out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>Would I could answer<lb/>
This comfort with the like! But I have words<lb/>
That would be howl'd out in the desert air,<lb/>
Where hearing should not latch them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>What concern they?<lb/>
The general cause? or is it a fee-grief<lb/>
Due to some single breast?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>No mind that's honest<lb/>
But in it shares some woe; though the main part<lb/>
Pertains to you alone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>If it be mine,<lb/>
Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,<lb/>
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound<lb/>
That ever yet they heard.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Hum! I guess at it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes<lb/>
Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,<lb/>
Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,<lb/>
To add the death of you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>Merciful heaven!<lb/>
What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;<lb/>
Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak<lb/>
Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>My children too?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>Wife, children, servants, all<lb/>
That could be found.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>And I must be from thence!<lb/>
My wife kill'd too?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>I have said.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>Be comforted:<lb/>
Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,<lb/>
To cure this deadly grief.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>He has no children. All my pretty ones?<lb/>
Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?<lb/>
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam<lb/>
At one fell swoop?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>Dispute it like a man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>I shall do so;<lb/>
But I must also feel it as a man:<lb/>
I cannot but remember such things were,<lb/>
That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,<lb/>
And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,<lb/>
They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,<lb/>
Not for their own demerits, but for mine,<lb/>
Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief<lb/>
Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>O, I could play the woman with mine eyes<lb/>
And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,<lb/>
Cut short all intermission; front to front<lb/>
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;<lb/>
Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,<lb/>
Heaven forgive him too!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>This tune goes manly.<lb/>
Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;<lb/>
Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth<lb/>
Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above<lb/>
Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:<lb/>
The night is long that never finds the day.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>Doctor</speaker>
<p>I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive<lb/>
no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gentlewoman</speaker>
<p>Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen<lb/>
her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon<lb/>
her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,<lb/>
write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again<lb/>
return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Doctor</speaker>
<p>A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once<lb/>
the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of<lb/>
watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her<lb/>
walking and other actual performances, what, at any<lb/>
time, have you heard her say?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gentlewoman</speaker>
<p>That, sir, which I will not report after her.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Doctor</speaker>
<p>You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gentlewoman</speaker>
<p>Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to<lb/>
confirm my speech.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper</stage></p>


<p>
Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;<lb/>
and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Doctor</speaker>
<p>How came she by that light?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gentlewoman</speaker>
<p>Why, it stood by her: she has light by her<lb/>
continually; 'tis her command.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Doctor</speaker>
<p>You see, her eyes are open.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gentlewoman</speaker>
<p>Ay, but their sense is shut.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Doctor</speaker>
<p>What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gentlewoman</speaker>
<p>It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus<lb/>
washing her hands: I have known her continue in<lb/>
this a quarter of an hour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Yet here's a spot.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Doctor</speaker>
<p>Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from<lb/>
her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Out, damned spot! out, I say!&mdash;One: two: why,<lb/>
then, 'tis time to do't.&mdash;Hell is murky!&mdash;Fie, my<lb/>
lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we<lb/>
fear who knows it, when none can call our power to<lb/>
account?&mdash;Yet who would have thought the old man<lb/>
to have had so much blood in him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Doctor</speaker>
<p>Do you mark that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?&mdash;<lb/>
What, will these hands ne'er be clean?&mdash;No more o'<lb/>
that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with<lb/>
this starting.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Doctor</speaker>
<p>Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gentlewoman</speaker>
<p>She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of<lb/>
that: heaven knows what she has known.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Here's the smell of the blood still: all the<lb/>
perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little<lb/>
hand. Oh, oh, oh!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Doctor</speaker>
<p>What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gentlewoman</speaker>
<p>I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the<lb/>
dignity of the whole body.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Doctor</speaker>
<p>Well, well, well,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gentlewoman</speaker>
<p>Pray God it be, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Doctor</speaker>
<p>This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known<lb/>
those which have walked in their sleep who have died<lb/>
holily in their beds.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so<lb/>
pale.&mdash;I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he<lb/>
cannot come out on's grave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Doctor</speaker>
<p>Even so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LADY MACBETH</speaker>
<p>To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:<lb/>
come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's<lb/>
done cannot be undone.&mdash;To bed, to bed, to bed!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Doctor</speaker>
<p>Will she go now to bed?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gentlewoman</speaker>
<p>Directly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Doctor</speaker>
<p>Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds<lb/>
Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds<lb/>
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:<lb/>
More needs she the divine than the physician.<lb/>
God, God forgive us all! Look after her;<lb/>
Remove from her the means of all annoyance,<lb/>
And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:<lb/>
My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.<lb/>
I think, but dare not speak.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Gentlewoman</speaker>
<p>Good night, good doctor.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>MENTEITH</speaker>
<p>The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,<lb/>
His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:<lb/>
Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes<lb/>
Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm<lb/>
Excite the mortified man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANGUS</speaker>
<p>Near Birnam wood<lb/>
Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAITHNESS</speaker>
<p>Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LENNOX</speaker>
<p>For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file<lb/>
Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,<lb/>
And many unrough youths that even now<lb/>
Protest their first of manhood.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENTEITH</speaker>
<p>What does the tyrant?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAITHNESS</speaker>
<p>Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:<lb/>
Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him<lb/>
Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,<lb/>
He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause<lb/>
Within the belt of rule.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANGUS</speaker>
<p>Now does he feel<lb/>
His secret murders sticking on his hands;<lb/>
Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;<lb/>
Those he commands move only in command,<lb/>
Nothing in love: now does he feel his title<lb/>
Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe<lb/>
Upon a dwarfish thief.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENTEITH</speaker>
<p>Who then shall blame<lb/>
His pester'd senses to recoil and start,<lb/>
When all that is within him does condemn<lb/>
Itself for being there?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CAITHNESS</speaker>
<p>Well, march we on,<lb/>
To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:<lb/>
Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,<lb/>
And with him pour we in our country's purge<lb/>
Each drop of us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LENNOX</speaker>

To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.<lb/>
Make we our march towards Birnam.<lb/>

<p>Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:<lb/>
Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,<lb/>
I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?<lb/>
Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know<lb/>
All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:<lb/>
'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman<lb/>
Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,<lb/>
false thanes,<lb/>
And mingle with the English epicures:<lb/>
The mind I sway by and the heart I bear<lb/>
Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.<lb/>

The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!<lb/>

<p>Soldiers, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,<lb/>
Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?<lb/>
Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine<lb/>
Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?<lb/>

<p>
Seyton!&mdash;I am sick at heart,<lb/>
When I behold&mdash;Seyton, I say!&mdash;This push<lb/>
Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.<lb/>
I have lived long enough: my way of life<lb/>
Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;<lb/>
And that which should accompany old age,<lb/>
As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,<lb/>
I must not look to have; but, in their stead,<lb/>
Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,<lb/>
Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton!<lb/>

<p>All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.<lb/>

Give me my armour.<lb/>

Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.<lb/>
How does your patient, doctor?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Doctor</speaker>
<p>Not so sick, my lord,<lb/>
As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,<lb/>
That keep her from her rest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Cure her of that.<lb/>
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,<lb/>
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,<lb/>
Raze out the written troubles of the brain<lb/>
And with some sweet oblivious antidote<lb/>
Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff<lb/>
Which weighs upon the heart?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Doctor</speaker>
<p>Therein the patient<lb/>
Must minister to himself.<lb/>

<p>Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.<lb/>
Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.<lb/>
Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me.<lb/>
Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast<lb/>
The water of my land, find her disease,<lb/>
And purge it to a sound and pristine health,<lb/>
I would applaud thee to the very echo,<lb/>
That should applaud again.&mdash;Pull't off, I say.&mdash;<lb/>
What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,<lb/>
Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?<lb/>

To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,<lb/>
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day<lb/>

The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!<lb/>
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player<lb/>

I pull in resolution, and begin<lb/>
To doubt the equivocation of the fiend<lb/>
That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood<lb/>
Do come to Dunsinane:'  and now a wood<lb/>
Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!<lb/>
If this which he avouches does appear,<lb/>
There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD, MACDUFF,	and their Army, with boughs</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.<lb/>
And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,<lb/>
Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,<lb/>
Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we<lb/>
Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,<lb/>
According to our order.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIWARD</speaker>
<p>Fare you well.<lb/>
Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,<lb/>
Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,<lb/>
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>

<head>Scene 7</head>

<p><stage>Another part of the field.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Alarums. Enter MACBETH</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,<lb/>
But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he<lb/>
That was not born of woman? Such a one<lb/>
Am I to fear, or none.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter YOUNG SIWARD</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>YOUNG SIWARD</speaker>
<p>What is thy name?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YOUNG SIWARD</speaker>
<p>No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name<lb/>
Than any is in hell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>My name's Macbeth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YOUNG SIWARD</speaker>
<p>The devil himself could not pronounce a title<lb/>
More hateful to mine ear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>No, nor more fearful.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>YOUNG SIWARD</speaker>
<p>Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword<lb/>
I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Thou wast born of woman<lb/>
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,<lb/>
Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p><p><stage>Alarums. Enter MACDUFF</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!<lb/>
If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,<lb/>
My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.<lb/>
I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms<lb/>
Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,<lb/>
Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge<lb/>
I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;<lb/>
By this great clatter, one of greatest note<lb/>
Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!<lb/>
And more I beg not.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit. Alarums</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIWARD</speaker>
<p>This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd:<lb/>
The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;<lb/>
The noble thanes do bravely in the war;<lb/>
The day almost itself professes yours,<lb/>
And little is to do.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>We have met with foes<lb/>
That strike beside us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIWARD</speaker>
<p>Enter, sir, the castle.<lb/>

</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt. Alarums</stage>



</p></div2><div2 type="scene" n="8" id="d37">
<head>Scene 8</head>

<p><stage>Another part of the field.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter MACBETH</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Why should I play the Roman fool, and die<lb/>
On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes<lb/>
Do better upon them.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter MACDUFF</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Turn, hell-hound, turn!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Of all men else I have avoided thee:<lb/>
But get thee back; my soul is too much charged<lb/>
With blood of thine already.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>I have no words:<lb/>
My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain<lb/>
Than terms can give thee out!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>They fight</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Thou losest labour:<lb/>
As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air<lb/>
With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:<lb/>
Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;<lb/>
I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,<lb/>
To one of woman born.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Despair thy charm;<lb/>
And let the angel whom thou still hast served<lb/>
Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb<lb/>
Untimely ripp'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,<lb/>
For it hath cow'd my better part of man!<lb/>
And be these juggling fiends no more believed,<lb/>
That palter with us in a double sense;<lb/>
That keep the word of promise to our ear,<lb/>
And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Then yield thee, coward,<lb/>
And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:<lb/>
We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,<lb/>
Painted on a pole, and underwrit,<lb/>
'Here may you see the tyrant.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACBETH</speaker>
<p>I will not yield,<lb/>
To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,<lb/>
And to be baited with the rabble's curse.<lb/>
Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,<lb/>
And thou opposed, being of no woman born,<lb/>
Yet I will try the last. Before my body<lb/>
I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,<lb/>
And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt, fighting. Alarums</stage>



</p><p><stage>Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours,	MALCOLM, SIWARD, ROSS, the other Thanes, and Soldiers</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIWARD</speaker>
<p>Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,<lb/>
So great a day as this is cheaply bought.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>Macduff is missing, and your noble son.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:<lb/>
He only lived but till he was a man;<lb/>
The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd<lb/>
In the unshrinking station where he fought,<lb/>
But like a man he died.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIWARD</speaker>
<p>Then he is dead?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow<lb/>
Must not be measured by his worth, for then<lb/>
It hath no end.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIWARD</speaker>
<p>Had he his hurts before?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ROSS</speaker>
<p>Ay, on the front.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIWARD</speaker>
<p>Why then, God's soldier be he!<lb/>
Had I as many sons as I have hairs,<lb/>
I would not wish them to a fairer death:<lb/>
And so, his knell is knoll'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>He's worth more sorrow,<lb/>
And that I'll spend for him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIWARD</speaker>
<p>He's worth no more<lb/>
They say he parted well, and paid his score:<lb/>
And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter MACDUFF, with MACBETH's head</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MACDUFF</speaker>
<p>Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands<lb/>
The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:<lb/>
I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,<lb/>
That speak my salutation in their minds;<lb/>
Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:<lb/>
Hail, King of Scotland!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALL</speaker>
<p>Hail, King of Scotland!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Flourish</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MALCOLM</speaker>
<p>We shall not spend a large expense of time<lb/>
Before we reckon with your several loves,<lb/>
And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,<lb/>
Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland<lb/>
In such an honour named. What's more to do,<lb/>
Which would be planted newly with the time,<lb/>
As calling home our exiled friends abroad<lb/>
That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;<lb/>
Producing forth the cruel ministers<lb/>
Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,<lb/>
Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands<lb/>
Took off her life; this, and what needful else<lb/>
That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,<lb/>
We will perform in measure, time and place:<lb/>
So, thanks to all at once and to each one,<lb/>
Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Flourish. Exeunt</stage></p>
