<p>Note: Other than omitting signatures, catchwords, and running
heads, converting long "s" to modern "s," converting the printed
form of abbreviation to, for example, "fro[m]," and indicating
italics, I have not intentionally made any
changes to the etext in my transcription, leaving the misprint
"roudelaies" as found, along with "." where modern editors put ","
and omitting the period at the end of some stanzas of
"Epithalamion" where it did not occur in the print text.</p>

Spenser's <hi rend="italic">Amoretti and Epithalamion</hi> was entered in the
<hi rend="italic">Stationers' Register</hi> on November 19, 1594, five months
after his marriage (the second) to Elizabeth Boyle, and it
is commonly assumed that she was the subject of the
poems.  The printer of the work was Peter Short and its
publisher William Ponsonby, who was responsible for
the publication of most of Spenser's poetry.

<l>AH when will this long vveary day haue end,</l>
<l>and lende me leaue to come vnto my loue?</l>
<l>Hovv slovvly do the houres theyr numbers spend?</l>
<l>How slowly does sad Time his feathers moue?</l>
<l>Hast thee O fayrest Planet to thy home</l>
<l>Within the Westerne some:</l>
<l>Thy tyred steedes long since haue need of rest.</l>
<l>Long though it be, at last I see it gloome,</l>
<l>And the bright euening star with golden creast</l>
<l>Appeare out of the East.</l>
<l>Fayre childe of beauty, glorious lampe of loue</l>
<l>That all the host of heauen in rankes doost lead,</l>
<l>And guydest louers through the nights dread,</l>
<l>How chearefully thou lookest from aboue,</l>
<l>And seemst to laugh atweene thy twinkling light</l>
<l>As ioying in the sight</l>
<l>Of these glad many which for ioy doe sing,</l>
<l>That all the woods them answer and their echo ring.</l>

<l>Now ceasse ye damsels your delights forepast,</l>
<l>Enough is it, that all the day was youres:</l>
<l>Now day is doen, and night is nighing fast:</l>
<l>Now bring the Bryde into the brydall boures.</l>
<l>Now night is come, now soone her disaray,</l>
<l>And in her bed her lay;</l>
<l>Lay her in lillies and in violets,</l>
<l>And silken courteins ouer her display,</l>
<l>And odourd sheetes, and Arras couerlets,</l>
<l>Behold how goodly my faire loue does ly</l>
<l>In proud humility;</l>
<l>Like vnto Maia, when as Ioue her tooke,</l>
<l>In Tempe, lying on the flowry gras,</l>
<l>Twixt sleepe and wake, after she weary was,</l>
<l>With bathing in the Acidalian brooke</l>
<l>Now it is night, ye damsels may be gon,</l>
<l>And leaue my loue alone,</l>
<l>And leaue likewise your former lay to sing:</l>
<l>The woods no more shal answere, nor your echo ring</l>

<l>NOw welcome night, thou night so long expected,</l>
<l>that long daies labour doest at last defray,</l>
<l>And all my cares, which cruell loue collected,</l>
<l>Hast sumd in one, and cancelled for aye:</l>
<l>Spread thy broad wing ouer my loue and me,</l>

<l>When he begot the great Tirynthian groome:</l>
