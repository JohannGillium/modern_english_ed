<div1 type="chapter" n="1" id="d5"><pb n="3"/>
<head>Sara</head>
<p>Once on a dark winter's day, when the yellow fog hung so thick
and heavy in the streets of London that the lamps were lighted and the
shop windows blazed with gas as they do at night, an odd-looking little
girl sat in a cab with her father and was driven rather slowly through the
big thoroughfares.</p>
<p>She sat with her feet tucked under her, and leaned against her
father, who held her in his arm, as she stared out of the window at the
passing people with a queer old-fashioned thoughtfulness in her big
eyes.</p>
<p>She was such a little girl that one did not expect to see such a look
on her small face.  It would have been an old look for a child of twelve,
and Sara Crewe was only seven. </p>

<pb n="4"/>
<p>  The fact was, however, that she was always dreaming and
thinking odd things and could not herself remember any time when she
had not been thinking things about grown-up people and the world they
belonged to.  She felt as if she had lived a long, long time.</p>
<p>At this moment she was remembering the voyage she had just
made from Bombay with her father, Captain Crewe.  She was thinking
of the big ship, of the Lascars passing silently to and fro on it, of the
children playing about on the hot deck, and of some young officers'
wives who used to try to make her talk to them and laugh at the things
she said.</p>
<p>Principally, she was thinking of what a queer thing it was that at
one time one was in India in the blazing sun, and then in the middle of
the ocean, and then driving in a strange vehicle through strange streets
where the day was as dark as the night.  She found this so puzzling that
she moved closer to her father.</p>
<p>"Papa," she said in a low, mysterious little voice which was almost
a whisper, "papa."</p>
<p>"What is it, darling?" Captain Crewe answered, holding her closer
and looking down into her face.  "What is Sara thinking of?"</p>
<p>"Is this the place?" Sara whispered, cuddling still closer to him.
"Is it, papa?"</p>
<p>"Yes, little Sara, it is.  We have reached it at last."  And though
she was only seven years old, she knew that he felt sad when he said
it.</p>
<p>It seemed to her many years since he had begun to prepare her
mind for "the place," as she always called it.  Her mother had died when
she was born, so she had never known or missed her.  Her young,
handsome, rich, petting father seemed to be the only relation she had in
the world.  They had always played together and been fond of each
other.  She

<pb n="5"/>  only knew he was rich because she had heard people say
so when they thought she was not listening, and she had also heard them
say that when she grew up she would be rich, too.  She did not know all
that being rich meant.  She had always lived in a beautiful bungalow,
and had been used to seeing many servants who made salaams to her and
called her "Missee Sahib," and gave her her own way in everything.
She had had toys and pets and an ayah who worshipped her, and she had
gradually learned that people who were rich had these things.  That,
however, was all she knew about it.</p>
<p>During her short life only one thing had troubled her, and that
thing was "the place" she was to be taken to some day.  The climate of
India was very bad for children, and as soon as possible they were sent
away from it&mdash;generally to England and to school.  She had seen other
children go away, and had heard their fathers and mothers talk about the
letters they received from them.  She had known that she would be
obliged to go also, and though sometimes her father's stories of the
voyage and the new country had attracted her, she had been troubled by
the thought that he could not stay with her.</p>
<p>"Couldn't you go to that place with me, papa?" she had asked
when she was five years old.  "Couldn't you go to school, too?  I would
help you with your lessons."</p>
<p>"But you will not have to stay for a very long time, little Sara," he
had always said.  "You will go to a nice house where there will be a lot
of little girls, and you will play together, and I will send you plenty of
books, and you will grow so fast that it will seem scarcely a year before
you are big enough and clever enough to come back and take care of
papa."</p>
<p>She had liked to think of that.  To keep the house for her father; to
ride with him, and sit at the head of his table

<pb n="6"/>  when he had dinner parties; to talk to him and read his
books&mdash;that would be what she would like most in the world, and if one
must go away to "the place" in England to attain it, she must make up
her mind to go.  She did not care very much for other little girls, but if
she had plenty of books she could console herself.  She liked books more
than anything else, and was, in fact, always inventing stories of beautiful
things and telling them to herself.  Sometimes she had told them to her
father, and he had liked them as much as she did.</p>
<p>"Well, papa," she said softly, "if we are here I suppose we must
be resigned."</p>
<p>He laughed at her old-fashioned speech and kissed her.  He was
really not at all resigned himself, though he knew he must keep that a
secret.  His quaint little Sara had been a great companion to him, and he
felt he should be a lonely fellow when, on his return to India, he went
into his bungalow knowing he need not expect to see the small figure in
its white frock come forward to meet him.  So he held her very closely
in his arms as the cab rolled into the big, dull square in which stood the
house which was their destination.</p>
<p>It was a big, dull, brick house, exactly like all the others in its
row, but that on the front door there shone a brass plate on which was
engraved in black letters: </p>
<p>                     MISS MINCHIN, </p>
<p>           Select Seminary for Young Ladies. </p>
<p>"Here we are, Sara," said Captain Crewe, making his voice sound
as cheerful as possible.  Then he lifted her out of the cab and they
mounted the steps and rang the bell.  Sara often thought afterward that
the house was somehow exactly like Miss Minchin.  It was respectable
and well furnished, but

<pb n="7"/>  everything in it was ugly; and the very armchairs seemed
to have hard bones in them.  In the hall everything was hard and
polished&mdash;even the red cheeks of the moon face on the tall clock in the
corner had a severe varnished look.  The drawing room into which they
were ushered was covered by a carpet with a square pattern upon it, the
chairs were square, and a heavy marble timepiece stood upon the heavy
marble mantel.</p>
<p>As she sat down in one of the stiff mahogany chairs, Sara cast one
of her quick looks about her.</p>
<p>"I don't like it, papa," she said.  "But then I dare say
soldiers &mdash; even brave ones &mdash; don't really like going into battle."</p>
<p>Captain Crewe laughed outright at this.  He was young and full of
fun, and he never tired of hearing Sara's queer speeches.</p>
<p>"Oh, little Sara," he said.  "What shall I do when I have no one to
say solemn things to me?  No one else is as solemn as you are."</p>
<p>"But why do solemn things make you laugh so?" inquired
Sara.</p>
<p>"Because you are such fun when you say them," he answered,
laughing still more.  And then suddenly he swept her into his arms and
kissed her very hard, stopping laughing all at once and looking almost as
if tears had come into his eyes.</p>
<p>It was just then that Miss Minchin entered the room.  She was
very like her house, Sara felt: tall and dull, and respectable and ugly.
She had large, cold, fishy eyes, and a large, cold, fishy smile.  It spread
itself into a very large smile when she saw Sara and Captain Crewe.
She had heard a great many desirable things of the young soldier from
the lady who had recommended her school to him.  Among other

<pb n="8"/>  things, she had heard that he was a rich father who was
willing to spend a great deal of money on his little daughter.</p>
<p>"It will be a great privilege to have charge of such a beautiful and
promising child, Captain Crewe," she said, taking Sara's hand and
stroking it.  "Lady Meredith has told me of her unusual cleverness.  A
clever child is a great treasure in an establishment like mine."</p>
<p>Sara stood quietly, with her eyes fixed upon Miss Minchin's face.
She was thinking something odd, as usual.</p>
<p>"Why does she say I am a beautiful child?" she was thinking.  "I
am not beautiful at all.  Colonel Grange's little girl, Isobel, is beautiful.
She has dimples and rose-colored cheeks, and long hair the color of
gold.  I have short black hair and green eyes; besides which, I am a thin
child and not fair in the least.  I am one of the ugliest children I ever
saw.  She is beginning by telling a story."</p>
<p>She was mistaken, however, in thinking she was an ugly child.
She was not in the least like Isobel Grange, who had been the beauty of
the regiment, but she had an odd charm of her own.  She was a slim,
supple creature, rather tall for her age, and had an intense, attractive
little face.  Her hair was heavy and quite black and only curled at the
tips; her eyes were greenish gray, it is true, but they were big,
wonderful eyes with long, black lashes, and though she herself did not
like the color of them, many other people did.  Still she was very firm in
her belief that she was an ugly little girl, and she was not at all elated by
Miss Minchin's flattery.</p>
<p>"I should be telling a story if I said she was beautiful," she
thought; "and I should know I was telling a story.  I believe I am as ugly
as she is&mdash;in my way.  What did she say that for?"</p>
<p>After she had known Miss Minchin longer she learned why she
had said it.  She discovered that she said the same

<pb n="9"/>  thing to each papa and mamma who brought a child to
her school.</p>
<p>Sara stood near her father and listened while he and Miss Minchin
talked.  She had been brought to the seminary because Lady Meredith's
two little girls had been educated there, and Captain Crewe had a great
respect for Lady Meredith's experience.  Sara was to be what was
known as "a parlor boarder," and she was to enjoy even greater
privileges than parlor boarders usually did.  She was to have a pretty
bedroom and sitting room of her own; she was to have a pony and a
carriage, and a maid to take the place of the ayah who had been her
nurse in India.</p>
<p>"I am not in the least anxious about her education," Captain Crewe
said, with his gay laugh, as he held Sara's hand and patted it.  "The
difficulty will be to keep her from learning too fast and too much.  She
is always sitting with her little nose burrowing into books.  She doesn't
read them, Miss Minchin; she gobbles them up as if she were a little
wolf instead of a little girl.  She is always starving for new books to
gobble, and she wants grown-up books&mdash;great, big, fat ones&mdash;French and
German as well as English&mdash;history and biography and poets, and all
sorts of things.  Drag her away from her books when she reads too
much.  Make her ride her pony in the Row or go out and buy a new
doll.  She ought to play more with dolls."</p>
<p>"Papa," said Sara, "you see, if I went out and bought a new doll
every few days I should have more than I could be fond of.  Dolls ought
to be intimate friends.  Emily is going to be my intimate friend."</p>

<p>Captain Crewe looked at Miss Minchin and Miss Minchin looked
at Captain Crewe.</p>
<p>"Who is Emily?" she inquired.</p>
<p>"Tell her, Sara," Captain Crewe said, smiling.</p>

<pb n="10"/>
<p>Sara's green-gray eyes looked very solemn and quite soft as she
answered.</p>
<p>"She is a doll I haven't got yet," she said.  "She is a doll papa is
going to buy for me.  We are going out together to find her.  I have
called her Emily.  She is going to be my friend when papa is gone.  I
want her to talk to about him."</p>
<p>Miss Minchin's large, fishy smile became very flattering
indeed.</p>
<p>"What an original child!" she said.  "What a darling little
creature!"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Captain Crewe, drawing Sara close.  "She is a darling
little creature.  Take great care of her for me, Miss Minchin."</p>
<p>Sara stayed with her father at his hotel for several days; in fact,
she remained with him until he sailed away again to India.  They went
out and visited many big shops together, and bought a great many things.
They bought, indeed, a great many more things than Sara needed; but
Captain Crewe was a rash, innocent young man and wanted his little girl
to have everything she admired and everything he admired himself, so
between them they collected a wardrobe much too grand for a child of
seven.  There were velvet dresses trimmed with costly furs, and lace
dresses, and embroidered ones, and hats with great, soft ostrich feathers,
and ermine coats and muffs, and boxes of tiny gloves and handkerchiefs
and silk stockings in such abundant supplies that the polite young women
behind the counters whispered to each other that the odd little girl with
the big, solemn eyes must be at least some foreign princess&mdash;perhaps the
little daughter of an Indian rajah.</p>
<p>And at last they found Emily, but they went to a number of toy
shops and looked at a great many dolls before they discovered
her.</p>

<pb n="11"/>
<p>"I want her to look as if she wasn't a doll really," Sara said.  "I
want her to look as if she listens when I talk to her.  The trouble with
dolls, papa"&mdash;and she put her head on one side and reflected as she said
it&mdash;"the trouble with dolls is that they never seem to hear."  So they
looked at big ones and little ones&mdash;at dolls with black eyes and dolls with
blue&mdash;at dolls with brown curls and dolls with golden braids, dolls
dressed and dolls undressed.</p>
<p>"You see," Sara said when they were examining one who had no
clothes.  "If, when I find her, she has no frocks, we can take her to a
dressmaker and have her things made to fit.  They will fit better if they
are tried on."</p>
<p>After a number of disappointments they decided to walk and look
in at the shop windows and let the cab follow them.  They had passed
two or three places without even going in, when, as they were
approaching a shop which was really not a very large one, Sara suddenly
started and clutched her father's arm.</p>
<p>"Oh, papa!" she cried.  "There is Emily!"</p>
<p>A flush had risen to her face and there was an expression in her
green-gray eyes as if she had just recognized someone she was intimate
with and fond of.</p>
<p>"She is actually waiting there for us!" she said.  "Let us go in to
her."</p>
<p>"Dear me," said Captain Crewe, "I feel as if we ought to have
someone to introduce us."</p>
<p>"You must introduce me and I will introduce you," said Sara.
"But I knew her the minute I saw her&mdash;so perhaps she knew me,
too."</p>
<p>Perhaps she had known her.  She had certainly a very intelligent
expression in her eyes when Sara took her in her arms.  She was a large
doll, but not too large to carry about easily; she had naturally curling
golden-brown hair, which

<pb n="12"/>


<pb n="13"/>
hung like a mantle about her, and her eyes were a deep,
clear, gray-blue, with soft, thick eyelashes which were real eyelashes and
not mere painted lines.</p>
<p>"Of course," said Sara, looking into her face as she held her on
her knee, "of course papa, this is Emily."</p>
<p>So Emily was bought and actually taken to a children's outfitter's
shop and measured for a wardrobe as grand as Sara's own.  She had lace
frocks, too, and velvet and muslin ones, and hats and coats and beautiful
lace-trimmed underclothes, and gloves and handkerchiefs and furs.</p>

<p>"I should like her always to look as if she was a child with a good
mother," said Sara.  "I'm her mother, though I am going to make a
companion of her."</p>
<p>Captain Crewe would really have enjoyed the shopping
tremendously, but that a sad thought kept tugging at his heart.  This all
meant that he was going to be separated from his beloved, quaint little
comrade.</p>
<p>He got out of his bed in the middle of that night and went and
stood looking down at Sara, who lay asleep with Emily in her arms.
Her black hair was spread out on the pillow and Emily's golden-brown
hair mingled with it, both of them had lace-ruffled nightgowns, and both
had long eyelashes which lay and curled up on their cheeks.  Emily
looked so like a real child that Captain Crewe felt glad she was there.
He drew a big sigh and pulled his mustache with a boyish
expression.</p>
<p>"Heigh-ho, little Sara!" he said to himself "I don't believe you
know how much your daddy will miss you."</p>
<p>The next day he took her to Miss Minchin's and left her there.  He
was to sail away the next morning.  He explained to Miss Minchin that
his solicitors, Messrs. Barrow &amp; Skipworth, had charge of his affairs in
England and would give her any advice she wanted, and that they would
pay the bills

<pb n="14"/>  she sent in for Sara's expenses.  He would write to Sara
twice a week, and she was to be given every pleasure she asked
for.</p>
<p>"She is a sensible little thing, and she never wants anything it isn't
safe to give her," he said.</p>
<p>Then he went with Sara into her little sitting room and they bade
each other good-by.  Sara sat on his knee and held the lapels of his coat
in her small hands, and looked long and hard at his face.</p>
<p>"Are you learning me by heart, little Sara?" he said, stroking her
hair.</p>
<p>"No," she answered.  "I know you by heart.  You are inside my
heart."  And they put their arms round each other and kissed as if they
would never let each other go.</p>
<p>When the cab drove away from the door, Sara was sitting on the
floor of her sitting room, with her hands under her chin and her eyes
following it until it had turned the corner of the square.  Emily was
sitting by her, and she looked after it, too.  When Miss Minchin sent her
sister, Miss Amelia, to see what the child was doing, she found she
could not open the door.</p>
<p>"I have locked it," said a queer, polite little voice from inside.  "I
want to be quite by myself, if you please."</p>
<p>Miss Amelia was fat and dumpy, and stood very much in awe of
her sister.  She was really the better-natured person of the two, but she
never disobeyed Miss Minchin.  She went downstairs again, looking
almost alarmed.</p>
<p>"I never saw such a funny, old-fashioned child, sister," she said.
"She has locked herself in, and she is not making the least particle of
noise."</p>
<p>"It is much better than if she kicked and screamed, as some of
them do," Miss Minchin answered.  "I expected that a child as much
spoiled as she is would set the whole house

<pb n="15"/>  in an uproar.  If ever a child was given her own way in
everything, she is."</p>
<p>"I've been opening her trunks and putting her things away," said
Miss Amelia.  "I never saw anything like them&mdash;sable and ermine on her
coats, and real Valenciennes lace on her underclothing.  You have seen
some of her clothes.  What do you think of them?"</p>
<p>"I think they are perfectly ridiculous," replied Miss Minchin,
sharply; "but they will look very well at the head of the line when we
take the schoolchildren to church on Sunday.  She has been provided for
as if she were a little princess."</p>
<p>And upstairs in the locked room Sara and Emily sat on         the
floor and stared at the corner round which the cab had disappeared,
while Captain Crewe looked backward, waving and kissing his hand as if
he could not bear to stop.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="2" id="d6"><pb n="16"/>
<head>A French Lesson</head>
<p>When Sara entered the schoolroom the next morning everybody
looked at her with wide, interested eyes.  By that time every pupil&mdash;from
Lavinia Herbert, who was nearly thirteen and felt quite grown up, to
Lottie Legh, who was only just four and the baby of the school&mdash;had
heard a great deal about her.  They knew very certainly that she was
Miss Minchin's show pupil and was considered a credit to the
establishment.  One or two of them had even caught a glimpse of her
French maid, Mariette, who had arrived the evening before.  Lavinia had
managed to pass Sara's room when the door was open, and had seen
Mariette opening a box which had arrived late from some shop.</p>

<pb n="17"/>
<p>"It was full of petticoats with lace frills on them&mdash;frills and frills,"
she whispered to her friend Jessie as she bent over her geography.  "I
saw her shaking them out.  I heard Miss Minchin say to Miss Amelia
that her clothes were so grand that they were ridiculous for a child.  My
mamma says that children should be dressed simply.  She has got one of
those petticoats on now.  I saw it when she sat down."</p>
<p>"She has silk stockings on!" whispered Jessie, bending over her
geography also.  "And what little feet!  I never saw such little
feet."</p>
<p>"Oh," sniffed Lavinia, spitefully, "that is the way her slippers are
made.  My mamma says that even big feet can be made to look small if
you have a clever shoemaker.  I don't think she is pretty at all.  Her
eyes are such a queer color."</p>
<p>"She isn't pretty as other pretty people are," said Jessie, stealing a
glance across the room; "but she makes you want to look at her again.
She has tremendously long eyelashes, but her eyes are almost
green."</p>
<p>Sara was sitting quietly in her seat, waiting to be told what to do.
She had been placed near Miss Minchin's desk.  She was not abashed at
all by the many pairs of eyes watching her.  She was interested and
looked back quietly at the children who looked at her.  She wondered
what they were thinking of, and if they liked Miss Minchin, and if they
cared for their lessons, and if any of them had a papa at all like her
own.  She had had a long talk with Emily about her papa that
morning.</p>
<p>"He is on the sea now, Emily," she had said.  "We must be very
great friends to each other and tell each other things.  Emily, look at me.
You have the nicest eyes I ever saw&mdash;but I wish you could speak."</p>

<p>She was a child full of imaginings and whimsical thoughts, and one
of her fancies was that there would be a great deal

<pb n="18"/> of comfort in even pretending that Emily was alive and
really heard and understood.  After Mariette had dressed her in her
dark-blue schoolroom frock and tied her hair with a darkblue ribbon, she
went to Emily, who sat in a chair of her own, and gave her a
book.</p>
<p>"You can read that while I am downstairs," she said; and, seeing
Mariette looking at her curiously, she spoke to her with a serious little
face.</p>
<p>"What I believe about dolls," she said, "is that they can do things
they will not let us know about.  Perhaps, really, Emily can read and
talk and walk, but she will only do it when people are out of the room.
That is her secret.  You see, if people knew that dolls could do things,
they would make them work.  So, perhaps, they have promised each
other to keep it a secret.  If you stay in the room, Emily will just sit
there and stare; but if you go out, she will begin to read, perhaps, or go
and look out of the window.  Then if she heard either of us coming, she
would just run back and jump into her chair and pretend she had been
there all the time."</p>
<p>"Comme elle est drole!" Mariette said to herself, and when she
went downstairs she told the head housemaid about it.  But she had
already begun to like this odd little girl who had such an intelligent small
face and such perfect manners.  She had taken care of children before
who were not so polite.  Sara was a very fine little person, and had a
gentle, appreciative way of saying, "If you please, Mariette," "Thank
you, Mariette," which was very charming.  Mariette told the head
housemaid that she thanked her as if she was thanking a lady.</p>
<p>"Elle a l'air d'une princesse, cette petite, " she said.  Indeed, she
was very much pleased with her new little mistress and liked her place
greatly.</p>

<pb n="19"/>
<p>After Sara had sat in her seat in the schoolroom for a few minutes,
being looked at by the pupils, Miss Minchin rapped in a dignified
manner upon her desk.</p>
<p>"Young ladies," she said, "I wish to introduce you to your new
companion."  All the little girls rose in their places, and Sara rose also.
"I shall expect you all to be very agreeable to Miss Crewe; she has just
come to us from a great distance&mdash;in fact, from India.  As soon as
lessons are over you must make each other's acquaintance."</p>
<p>The pupils bowed ceremoniously, and Sara made a little curtsy,
and then they sat down and looked at each other again.</p>
<p>"Sara," said Miss Minchin in her schoolroom manner, "come here
to me."</p>
<p>She had taken a book from the desk and was turning over its
leaves.  Sara went to her politely.</p>
<p>"As your papa has engaged a French maid for you," she began, "I
conclude that he wishes you to make a special study of the French
language."</p>
<p>Sara felt a little awkward.</p>
<p>"I think he engaged her," she said, "because he&mdash;he thought I
would like her, Miss Minchin."</p>
<p>"I am afraid," said Miss Minchin, with a slightly sour smile, "that
you have been a very spoiled little girl and always imagine that things
are done because you like them.  My impression is that your papa
wished you to learn French."</p>
<p>If Sara had been older or less punctilious about being quite polite
to people, she could have explained herself in a very few words.  But, as
it was, she felt a flush rising on her cheeks.  Miss Minchin was a very
severe and imposing person, and she seemed so absolutely sure that Sara
knew nothing whatever of French that she felt as if it would be almost
rude to correct her.  The truth was that Sara could not remember

<pb n="20"/>  the time when she had not seemed to know French.
Her father had often spoken it to her when she had been a baby.  Her
mother had been a French woman, and Captain Crewe had loved her
language, so it happened that Sara had always heard and been familiar
with it.</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I have never really learned French, but&mdash;but&mdash;" she began,
trying shyly to make herself clear.</p>
<p>One of Miss Minchin's chief secret annoyances was that she did
not speak French herself, and was desirous of concealing the irritating
fact.  She, therefore, had no intention of discussing the matter and laying
herself open to innocent questioning by a new little pupil.</p>
<p>"That is enough," she said with polite tartness.  "If you have not
learned, you must begin at once.  The French master, Monsieur
Dufarge, will be here in a few minutes.  Take this book and look at it
until he arrives."</p>
<p>Sara's cheeks felt warm.  She went back to her seat and opened
the book.  She looked at the first page with a grave face.  She knew it
would be rude to smile, and she was very determined not to be rude.
But it was very odd to find herself expected to study a page which told
her that "le pere" meant "the father," and "la mere" meant "the
mother."</p>
<p>Miss Minchin glanced toward her scrutinizingly.</p>
<p>"You look rather cross, Sara," she said.  "I am sorry you do not
like the idea of learning French."</p>
<p>"I am very fond of it," answered Sara, thinking she would try
again; "but&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You must not say 'but' when you are told to do things," said
Miss Minchin.  "Look at your book again."</p>
<p>And Sara did so, and did not smile, even when she found that "le
fils" meant "the son," and "le frere" meant "the brother."</p>
<p>" When Monsieur Dufarge comes," she thought, "I can make him
understand."</p>

<pb n="21"/>
<p>Monsieur Dufarge arrived very shortly afterward.  He was a very
nice, intelligent, middle-aged Frenchman, and he looked interested when
his eyes fell upon Sara trying politely to seem absorbed in her little book
of phrases.</p>
<p>"Is this a new pupil for me, madame?" he said to Miss Minchin.
"I hope that is my good fortune."</p>
<p>"Her papa&mdash;Captain Crewe&mdash;is very anxious that she should begin
the language.  But I am afraid she has a childish prejudice against it.
She does not seem to wish to learn," said Miss Minchin.</p>
<p>"I am sorry of that, mademoiselle," he said kindly to Sara.
"Perhaps, when we begin to study together, I may show you that it is a
charming tongue."</p>
<p>Little Sara rose in her seat.  She was beginning to feel rather
desperate, as if she were almost in disgrace.  She looked up into
Monsieur Dufarge's face with her big, green-gray eyes, and they were
quite innocently appealing.  She knew that he would understand as soon
as she spoke.  She began to explain quite simply in pretty and fluent
French.  Madame had not understood.  She had not learned French
exactly&mdash;not out of books&mdash;but her papa and other people had always
spoken it to her, and she had read it and written it as she had read and
written English.  Her papa loved it, and she loved it because he did.
Her dear mamma, who had died when she was born, had been French.
She would be glad to learn anything monsieur would teach her, but what
she had tried to explain to madame was that she already knew the words
in this book&mdash;and she held out the little book of phrases.</p>
<p>When she began to speak Miss Minchin started quite violently and
sat staring at her over her eyeglasses, almost indignantly, until she had
finished.  Monsieur Dufarge began to smile, and his smile was one of
great pleasure.  To hear this pretty childish voice speaking his own
language so simply

<pb n="22"/>  and charmingly made him feel almost as if he were in
his native land&mdash;which in dark, foggy days in London sometimes seemed
worlds away.  When she had finished, he took the phrase book from her,
with a look almost affectionate.  But he spoke to Miss Minchin.</p>
<p>"Ah, madame," he said, "there is not much I can teach her.  She
has not learned French; she is French.  Her accent is exquisite."</p>
<p>"You ought to have told me," exclaimed Miss Minchin, much
mortified, turning to Sara.</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I tried," said Sara.  "I&mdash;I suppose I did not begin right."</p>

<p>Miss Minchin knew she had tried, and that it had not been her
fault that she was not allowed to explain.  And when she saw that the
pupils had been listening and that Lavinia and Jessie were giggling
behind their French grammars, she felt infuriated.</p>
<p>"Silence, young ladies!" she said severely, rapping upon the desk.
"Silence at once!"</p>
<p>And she began from that minute to feel rather a grudge against her
show pupil.</p>

</div1>



<div1 type="chapter" n="3" id="d7"><pb n="23"/>
<head>Ermengarde</head>
<p>On that first morning, when Sara sat at Miss Minchin's side,
aware that the whole schoolroom was devoting itself to observing her,
she had noticed very soon one little girl, about her own age, who looked
at her very hard with a pair of light, rather dull, blue eyes.  She was a
fat child who did not look as if she were in the least clever, but she had
a goodnaturedly pouting mouth.  Her flaxen hair was braided in a tight
pigtail, tied with a ribbon, and she had pulled this pigtail around her
neck, and was biting the end of the ribbon, resting her elbows on the
desk, as she stared wonderingly at the

<pb n="24"/>  new pupil.  When Monsieur Dufarge began to speak to
Sara, she looked a little frightened; and when Sara stepped forward and,
looking at him with the innocent, appealing eyes, answered him, without
any warning, in French, the fat little girl gave a startled jump, and grew
quite red in her awed amazement.  Having wept hopeless tears for weeks
in her efforts to remember that "la mere" meant "the mother," and "le
pere," "the father,"&mdash;when one spoke sensible English&mdash;it was almost too
much for her suddenly to find herself listening to a child her own age
who seemed not only quite familiar with these words, but apparently
knew any number of others, and could mix them up with verbs as if they
were mere trifles.</p>
<p>She stared so hard and bit the ribbon on her pigtail so fast that she
attracted the attention of Miss Minchin, who, feeling extremely cross at
the moment, immediately pounced upon her.</p>
<p>"Miss St. John!" she exclaimed severely.  "What do you mean by
such conduct?  Remove your elbows!  Take your ribbon out of your
mouth!  Sit up at once!"</p>
<p>Upon which Miss St. John gave another jump, and when Lavinia
and Jessie tittered she became redder than ever&mdash;so red, indeed, that she
almost looked as if tears were coming into her poor, dull, childish eyes;
and Sara saw her and was so sorry for her that she began rather to like
her and want to be her friend.  It was a way of hers always to want to
spring into any fray in which someone was made uncomfortable or
unhappy.</p>
<p>"If Sara had been a boy and lived a few centuries ago," her father
used to say, "she would have gone about the country with her sword
drawn, rescuing and defending everyone in distress.  She always wants
to fight when she sees people in trouble."</p>
<p>So she took rather a fancy to fat, slow, little Miss St.

<pb n="25"/>  John, and kept glancing toward her through the
morning.  She saw that lessons were no easy matter to her, and that
there was no danger of her ever being spoiled by being treated as a show
pupil.  Her French lesson was a pathetic thing.  Her pronunciation made
even Monsieur Dufarge smile in spite of himself, and Lavinia and Jessie
and the more fortunate girls either giggled or looked at her in wondering
disdain.  But Sara did not laugh.  She tried to look as if she did not hear
when Miss St. John called "le bon pain," "lee bong pang." She had a
fine, hot little temper of her own, and it made her feel rather savage
when she heard the titters and saw the poor, stupid, distressed child's
face.</p>
<p>"It isn't funny, really," she said between her teeth, as she bent
over her book.  "They ought not to laugh."</p>
<p>When lessons were over and the pupils gathered together in groups
to talk, Sara looked for Miss St. John, and finding her bundled rather
disconsolately in a window-seat, she walked over to her and spoke.  She
only said the kind of thing little girls always say to each other by way of
beginning an acquaintance, but there was something friendly about Sara,
and people always felt it.</p>
<p>"What is your name?" she said.</p>
<p>To explain Miss St. John's amazement one must recall that a new
pupil is, for a short time, a somewhat uncertain thing; and of this new
pupil the entire school had talked the night before until it fell asleep quite
exhausted by excitement and contradictory stories.  A new pupil with a
carriage and a pony and a maid, and a voyage from India to discuss, was
not an ordinary acquaintance.</p>
<p>"My name's Ermengarde St. John," she answered.</p>
<p>"Mine is Sara Crewe," said Sara.  "Yours is very pretty.  It
sounds like a story book."</p>
<p>"Do you like it?" fluttered Ermengarde.  "I&mdash;I like yours."</p>
<p>Miss St. John's chief trouble in life was that she had a

<pb n="26"/>  clever father.  Sometimes this seemed to her a dreadful
calamity.  If you have a father who knows everything, who speaks seven
or eight languages, and has thousands of volumes which he has
apparently learned by heart, he frequently expects you to be familiar
with the contents of your lesson books at least; and it is not improbable
that he will feel you ought to be able to remember a few incidents of
history and to write a French exercise.  Ermengarde was a severe trial to
Mr. St. John.  He could not understand how a child of his could be a
notably and unmistakably dull creature who never shone in
anything.</p>
<p>"Good heavens!" he had said more than once, as he stared at her,
"there are times when I think she is as stupid as her Aunt Eliza!"</p>

<p>If her Aunt Eliza had been slow to learn and quick to forget a
thing entirely when she had learned it, Ermengarde was strikingly like
her.  She was the monumental dunce of the school, and it could not be
denied.</p>
<p>"She must be made to learn," her father said to Miss
Minchin.</p>
<p>Consequently Ermengarde spent the greater part of her life in
disgrace or in tears.  She learned things and forgot them; or, if she
remembered them, she did not understand them.  So it was natural that,
having made Sara's acquaintance, she should sit and stare at her with
profound admiration.</p>
<p>"You can speak French, can't you?" she said respectfully.</p>
<p>Sara got on to the window-seat, which was a big, deep one, and,
tucking up her feet, sat with her hands clasped round her knees.</p>
<p>"I can speak it because I have heard it all my life," she answered.
"You could speak it if you had always heard it."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, I couldn't," said Ermengarde.  "I never could speak it!"
</p>

<pb n="27"/>
<p>"Why?" inquired Sara, curiously.</p>
<p>Ermengarde shook her head so that the pigtail wobbled.</p>
<p>"You heard me just now," she said.  "I'm always like that.  I can't
say the words.  They're so queer."</p>
<p>She paused a moment, and then added with a touch of awe in her
voice, "You are clever, aren't you?"</p>
<p>Sara looked out of the window into the dingy square, where the
sparrows were hopping and twittering on the wet, iron railings and the
sooty branches of the trees.  She reflected a few moments.  She had
heard it said very often that she was "clever," and she wondered if she
was&mdash;and if she was, how it had happened.</p>
<p>"I don't know," she said.  "I can't tell."  Then, seeing a mournful
look on the round, chubby face, she gave a little laugh and changed the
subject.</p>
<p>"Would you like to see Emily?" she inquired.</p>
<p>"Who is Emily?" Ermengarde asked, just as Miss Minchin had
done.</p>
<p>"Come up to my room and see," said Sara, holding out her
hand.</p>
<p>They jumped down from the window-seat together, and went
upstairs.</p>
<p>"Is it true," Ermengarde whispered, as they went through the
hall&mdash;"is it true that you have a playroom all to yourself?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Sara answered.  "Papa asked Miss Minchin to let me have
one, because&mdash;well, it was because when I play I make up stories and tell
them to myself, and I don't like people to hear me.  It spoils it if I think
people listen."</p>
<p>They had reached the passage leading to Sara's room by this time,
and Ermengarde stopped short, staring, and quite losing her
breath.</p>
<p>"You make up stories!" she gasped.  "Can you do that&mdash;as well as
speak French?  Can you?"  </p>

<pb n="28"/>
<p>Sara looked at her in simple surprise.</p>
<p>"Why, anyone can make up things," she said.  "Have you never
tried?"</p>
<p>She put her hand warningly on Ermengarde's.</p>
<p>"Let us go very quietly to the door," she whispered, "and then I
will open it quite suddenly; perhaps we may catch her."</p>
<p>She was half laughing, but there was a touch of mysterious hope in
her eyes which fascinated Ermengarde, though she had not the remotest
idea what it meant, or whom it was she wanted to "catch," or why she
wanted to catch her.  Whatsoever she meant, Ermengarde was sure it
was something delightfully exciting.  So, quite thrilled with expectation,
she followed her on tiptoe along the passage.  They made not the least
noise until they reached the door.  Then Sara suddenly turned the handle,
and threw it wide open.  Its opening revealed the room quite neat and
quiet, a fire gently burning in the grate, and a wonderful doll sitting in a
chair by it, apparently reading a book.</p>
<p>"Oh, she got back to her seat before we could see her!" Sara
explained.  "Of course they always do.  They are as quick as
lightning."</p>
<p>Ermengarde looked from her to the doll and back again.</p>
<p>"Can she&mdash;walk?" she asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>"Yes," answered Sara.  "At least I believe she can.  At least I
pretend I believe she can.  And that makes it seem as if it were true.
Have you never pretended things?"</p>
<p>"No," said Ermengarde.  "Never.  I&mdash;tell me about it."</p>
<p>She was so bewitched by this odd, new companion that she
actually stared at Sara instead of at Emily&mdash;notwithstanding that Emily
was the most attractive doll person she had ever seen.</p>
<p>"Let us sit down," said Sara, "and I will tell you.  It's

<pb n="29"/> so easy that when you begin you can't stop.  You just go
on and on doing it always.  And it's beautiful.  Emily, you must listen.
This is Ermengarde St. John, Emily.  Ermengarde, this is Emily.
Would you like to hold her?"</p>
<p>"Oh, may I?" said Ermengarde.  "May I, really?  She is
beautiful!"  And Emily was put into her arms.</p>
<p>Never in her dull, short life had Miss St. John dreamed of such an
hour as the one she spent with the queer new pupil before they heard the
lunch-bell ring and were obliged to go downstairs.</p>
<p>Sara sat upon the hearth-rug and told her strange things.  She sat
rather huddled up, and her green eyes shone and her cheeks flushed.
She told stories of the voyage, and stories of India; but what fascinated
Ermengarde the most was her fancy about the dolls who walked and
talked, and who could do anything they chose when the human beings
were out of the room, but who must keep their powers a secret and so
flew back to their places "like lightning" when people returned to the
room.</p>
<p>"We couldn't do it," said Sara, seriously.  "You see, it's a kind of
magic."</p>
<p>Once, when she was relating the story of the search for Emily,
Ermengarde saw her face suddenly change.  A cloud seemed to pass over
it and put out the light in her shining eyes.  She drew her breath in so
sharply that it made a funny, sad little sound, and then she shut her lips
and held them tightly closed, as if she was determined either to do or not
to do something.  Ermengarde had an idea that if she had been like any
other little girl, she might have suddenly burst out sobbing and crying.
But she did not.</p>
<p>"Have you a&mdash;a pain?" Ermengarde ventured.</p>
<p>"Yes," Sara answered, after a moment's silence.  "But it is not in
my body."  Then she added something in a low

<pb n="30"/>  voice which she tried to keep quite steady, and it was
this: "Do you love your father more than anything else in all the whole
world?"</p>
<p>Ermengarde's mouth fell open a little.  She knew that it would be
far from behaving like a respectable child at a select seminary to say that
it had never occurred to you that you could love your father, that you
would do anything desperate to avoid being left alone in his society for
ten minutes.  She was, indeed, greatly embarrassed.</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I scarcely ever see him," she stammered.  "He is always in the
library&mdash;reading things."</p>
<p>"I love mine more than all the world ten times over," Sara said.
"That is what my pain is.  He has gone away."</p>
<p>She put her head quietly down on her little, huddled-up knees, and
sat very still for a few minutes.</p>
<p>"She's going to cry out loud," thought Ermengarde,
fearfully.</p>
<p>But she did not.  Her short, black locks tumbled about her ears,
and she sat still.  Then she spoke without lifting her head.</p>
<p>"I promised him I would bear it," she said.  "And I will.  You
have to bear things.  Think what soldiers bear!  Papa is a soldier.  If
there was a war he would have to bear marching and thirstiness and,
perhaps, deep wounds.  And he would never say a word&mdash;not one
word."</p>
<p>Ermengarde could only gaze at her, but she felt that she was
beginning to adore her.  She was so wonderful and different from anyone
else.</p>
<p>Presently, she lifted her face and shook back her black locks, with
a queer little smile.</p>
<p>"If I go on talking and talking," she said, "and telling you things
about pretending, I shall bear it better.  You don't forget, but you bear it
better."  </p>

<pb n="31"/>
<p>Ermengarde did not know why a lump came into her throat and
her eyes felt as if tears were in them.</p>
<p>"Lavinia and Jessie are 'best friends,'" she said rather huskily.  "I
wish we could be 'best friends.'  Would you have me for yours?  You're
clever, and I'm the stupidest child in the school, but I&mdash;oh, I do so like
you!"</p>
<p>"I'm glad of that," said Sara.  "It makes you thankful when you
are liked.  Yes.  We will be friends.  And I'll tell you what"&mdash;a sudden
gleam lighting her face&mdash;"I can help you with your French lessons."
</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="4" id="d8"><pb n="32"/>
<head>Lottie</head>
<p>If Sara had been a different kind of child, the life she led at Miss
Minchin's Select Seminary for the next few years would not have been at
all good for her.  She was treated more as if she were a distinguished
guest at the establishment than as if she were a mere little girl.  If she
had been a self-opinionated, domineering child, she might have become
disagreeable enough to be unbearable through being so much indulged
and flattered.  If she had been an indolent child, she would have learned
nothing.  Privately Miss Minchin disliked her, but she was far too
worldly a woman to do or say anything which might make such a
desirable pupil wish to leave her school.  She knew quite well that if
Sara wrote to her papa to tell him she was uncomfortable or unhappy,

<pb n="33"/> Captain Crewe would remove her at once.  Miss
Minchin's opinion was that if a child were continually praised and never
forbidden to do what she liked, she would be sure to be fond of the place
where she was so treated.  Accordingly, Sara was praised for her
quickness at her lessons, for her good manners, for her amiability to her
fellow pupils, for her generosity if she gave sixpence to a beggar out of
her full little purse; the simplest thing she did was treated as if it were a
virtue, and if she had not had a disposition and a clever little brain, she
might have been a very self-satisfied young person.  But the clever little
brain told her a great many sensible and true things about herself and her
circumstances, and now and then she talked these things over to
Ermengarde as time went on.</p>
<p>"Things happen to people by accident," she used to say.  "A lot of
nice accidents have happened to me.  It just happened that I always liked
lessons and books, and could remember things when I learned them.  It
just happened that I was born with a father who was beautiful and nice
and clever, and could give me everything I liked.  Perhaps I have not
really a good temper at all, but if you have everything you want and
everyone is kind to you, how can you help but be good-tempered?  I
don't know"&mdash;looking quite serious&mdash;"how I shall ever find out whether I
am really a nice child or a horrid one.  Perhaps I'm a hideous child, and
no one will ever know, just because I never have any trials."</p>
<p>"Lavinia has no trials," said Ermengarde, stolidly, "and she is
horrid enough."</p>
<p>Sara rubbed the end of her little nose reflectively, as she thought
the matter over.</p>
<p>"Well," she said at last, "perhaps&mdash;perhaps that is because Lavinia
is growing."</p>
<p>This was the result of a charitable recollection of having

<pb n="34"/>  heard Miss Amelia say that Lavinia was growing so fast
that she believed it affected her health and temper.</p>
<p>Lavinia, in fact, was spiteful.  She was inordinately jealous of
Sara.  Until the new pupil's arrival, she had felt herself the leader in the
school.  She had led because she was capable of making herself
extremely disagreeable if the others did not follow her.  She domineered
over the little children, and assumed grand airs with those big enough to
be her companions.  She was rather pretty, and had been the
best-dressed pupil in the procession when the Select Seminary walked out
two by two, until Sara's velvet coats and sable muffs appeared,
combined with drooping ostrich feathers, and were led by Miss Minchin
at the head of the line.  This, at the beginning, had been bitter enough;
but as time went on it became apparent that Sara was a leader, too, and
not because she could make herself disagreeable, but because she never
did.</p>
<p>"There's one thing about Sara Crewe," Jessie had enraged her
"best friend" by saying honestly, "she's never 'grand' about herself the
least bit, and you know she might be, Lavvie.  I believe I couldn't help
being&mdash;just a little&mdash;if I had so many fine things and was made such a fuss
over.  It's disgusting, the way Miss Minchin shows her off when parents
come."</p>
<p>"'Dear Sara must come into the drawing room and talk to Mrs.
Musgrave about India,'" mimicked Lavinia, in her most highly flavored
imitation of Miss Minchin.  "'Dear Sara must speak French to Lady
Pitkin.  Her accent is so perfect.' She didn't learn her French at the
Seminary, at any rate.  And there's nothing so clever in her knowing it.
She says herself she didn't learn it at all.  She just picked it up, because
she always heard her papa speak it.  And, as to her papa, there is
nothing so grand in being an Indian officer."  </p>

<pb n="35"/>
<p>"Well," said Jessie, slowly, "he's killed tigers.  He killed the one
in the skin Sara has in her room.  That's why she likes it so.  She lies
on it and strokes its head, and talks to it as if it was a cat."</p>
<p>"She's always doing something silly," snapped Lavinia.  "My
mamma says that way of hers of pretending things is silly.  She says she
will grow up eccentric."</p>
<p>lt was quite true that Sara was never "grand."  She was a friendly
little soul, and shared her privileges and belongings with a free hand.
The little ones, who were accustomed to being disdained and ordered out
of the way by mature ladies aged ten and twelve, were never made to
cry by this most envied of them all.  She was a motherly young person,
and when people fell down and scraped their knees, she ran and helped
them up and patted them, or found in her pocket a bonbon or some other
article of a soothing nature.  She never pushed them out of her way or
alluded to their years as a humiliation and a blot upon their small
characters.</p>
<p>"If you are four you are four," she said severely to Lavinia on an
occasion of her having&mdash;it must be confessed&mdash;slapped Lottie and called
her "a brat;" "but you will be five next year, and six the year after that.
And," opening large, convicting eyes, "it takes sixteen years to make
you twenty."</p>
<p>"Dear me," said Lavinia, "how we can calculate!"  In fact, it was
not to be denied that sixteen and four made twenty&mdash;and twenty was an
age the most daring were scarcely bold enough to dream of.</p>
<p>So the younger children adored Sara.  More than once she had
been known to have a tea party, made up of these despised ones, in her
own room.  And Emily had been played with, and Emily's own tea
service used&mdash;the one with cups which held quite a lot of much-sweetened
weak tea and had blue flowers on them.  No one had seen such a very
real doll's

<pb n="36"/> tea set before.  From that afternoon Sara was regarded as
a goddess and a queen by the entire alphabet class.</p>
<p>Lottle Legh worshipped her to such an extent that if Sara had not
been a motherly person, she would have found her tiresome.  Lottie had
been sent to school by a rather flighty young papa who could not
imagine what else to do with her.  Her young mother had died, and as
the child had been treated like a favorite doll or a very spoiled pet
monkey or lap dog ever since the first hour of her life, she was a very
appalling little creature.  When she wanted anything or did not want
anything she wept and howled; and, as she always wanted the things she
could not have, and did not want the things that were best for her, her
shrill little voice was usually to be heard uplifted in wails in one part of
the house or another.</p>
<p>Her strongest weapon was that in some mysterious way she had
found out that a very small girl who had lost her mother was a person
who ought to be pitied and made much of.  She had probably heard
some grown-up people talking her over in the early days, after her
mother's death.  So it became her habit to make great use of this
knowledge.</p>
<p>The first time Sara took her in charge was one morning when, on
passing a sitting room, she heard both Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia
trying to suppress the angry wails of some child who, evidently, refused
to be silenced.  She refused so strenuously indeed that Miss Minchin was
obliged to almost shout&mdash;in a stately and severe manner&mdash;to make herself
heard.</p>
<p>"What is she crying for?" she almost yelled.</p>
<p>"Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;oh!" Sara heard; "I haven't got any mam&mdash;ma-a!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Lottie!" screamed Miss Amelia.  "Do stop, darling! Don't
cry!  Please don't!"  </p>

<pb n="37"/>
<p>"Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!" Lottle howled tempestuously.
"Haven't&mdash;got&mdash;any&mdash;mam&mdash;ma-a!"</p>
<p>"She ought to be whipped," Miss Minchin proclaimed.  "You shall
be whipped, you naughty child!"</p>
<p>Lottle wailed more loudly than ever.  Miss Amelia began to cry.
Miss Minchin's voice rose until it almost thundered, then suddenly she
sprang up from her chair in impotent indignation and flounced out of the
room, leaving Miss Amelia to arrange the matter.</p>
<p>Sara had paused in the hall, wondering if she ought to go into the
room, because she had recently begun a friendly acquaintance with Lottie
and might be able to quiet her.  When Miss Minchin came out and saw
her, she looked rather annoyed.  She realized that her voice, as heard
from inside the room, could not have sounded either dignified or
amiable.</p>
<p>"Oh, Sara!" she exclaimed, endeavoring to produce a suitable
smile.</p>
<p>"I stopped," explained Sara, "because I knew it was Lottie&mdash;and I
thought, perhaps&mdash;just perhaps, I could make her be quiet.  May I try,
Miss Minchin?"</p>
<p>"If you can, you are a clever child," answered Miss Minchin,
drawing in her mouth sharply.  Then, seeing that Sara looked slightly
chilled by her asperity, she changed her manner.  "But you are clever in
everything," she said in her approving way.  "I dare say you can manage
her.  Go in." And she left her.</p>
<p>When Sara entered the room, Lottie was lying upon the floor,
screaming and kicking her small fat legs violently, and Miss Amelia was
bending over her in consternation and despair, looking quite red and
damp with heat.  Lottie had always found, when in her own nursery at
home, that kicking and screaming would always be quieted by any means
she

<pb n="38"/> insisted on.  Poor plump Miss Amelia was trying first
one method, and then another.</p>
<p>"Poor darling," she said one moment, "I know you haven't any
mamma, poor&mdash;"  Then in quite another tone, "If you don't stop, Lottie,
I will shake you.  Poor little angel! There&mdash;!  You wicked, bad,
detestable child, I will smack you!  I will!"</p>
<p>Sara went to them quietly.  She did not know at all what she was
going to do, but she had a vague inward conviction that it would be
better not to say such different kinds of things quite so helplessly and
excitedly.</p>
<p>"Miss Amelia," she said in a low voice, "Miss Minchin says I may
try to make her stop&mdash;may I?"</p>
<p>Miss Amelia turned and looked at her hopelessly.  "Oh, do you
think you can?" she gasped.</p>
<p>"I don't know whether I can," answered Sara, still in her
half-whisper; "but I will try."</p>
<p>Miss Amelia stumbled up from her knees with a heavy sigh, and
Lottie's fat little legs kicked as hard as ever.</p>
<p>"If you will steal out of the room," said Sara, "I will stay with
her."</p>
<p>"Oh, Sara!" almost whimpered Miss Amelia.  "We never had such
a dreadful child before.  I don't believe we can keep her."</p>
<p>But she crept out of the room, and was very much relieved to find
an excuse for doing it.</p>
<p>Sara stood by the howling furious child for a few moments, and
looked down at her without saying anything.  Then she sat down flat on
the floor beside her and waited.  Except for Lottie's angry screams, the
room was quite quiet.  This was a new state of affairs for little Miss
Legh, who was accustomed, when she screamed, to hear other people
protest and implore and command and coax by turns.  To lie and

<pb n="39"/> kick and shriek, and find the only person near you not
seeming to mind in the least, attracted her attention.  She opened her
tight-shut streaming eyes to see who this person was.  And it was only
another little girl.  But it was the one who owned Emily and all the nice
things.  And she was looking at her steadily and as if she was merely
thinking.  Having paused for a few seconds to find this out, Lottie
thought she must begin again, but the quiet of the room and of Sara's
odd, interested face made her first howl rather half-hearted.</p>
<p>"I&mdash;haven't&mdash;any&mdash;ma&mdash;ma&mdash;ma-a!" she announced; but her voice
was not so strong.</p>
<p>Sara looked at her still more steadily, but with a sort of
understanding in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Neither have I," she said.</p>
<p>This was so unexpected that it was astounding.  Lottie actually
dropped her legs, gave a wriggle, and lay and stared.  A new idea will
stop a crying child when nothing else will.  Also it was true that while
Lottie disliked Miss Minchin, who was cross, and Miss Amelia, who
was foolishly indulgent, she rather liked Sara, little as she knew her.
She did not want to give up her grievance, but her thoughts were
distracted from it, so she wriggled again, and, after a sulky sob, said,
"Where is she?"</p>
<p>Sara paused a moment.  Because she had been told that her
mamma was in heaven, she had thought a great deal about the matter,
and her thoughts had not been quite like those of other people.</p>
<p>"She went to heaven," she said.  "But I am sure she comes out
sometimes to see me&mdash;though I don't see her.  So does yours.  Perhaps
they can both see us now.  Perhaps they are both in this room."</p>
<p>Lottle sat bolt upright, and looked about her.  She was a pretty,
little, curly-headed creature, and her round eyes

<pb n="40"/> were like wet forget-me-nots.  If her mamma had seen
her during the last half-hour, she might not have thought her the kind of
child who ought to be related to an angel.</p>
<p>Sara went on talking.  Perhaps some people might think that what
she said was rather like a fairy story, but it was all so real to her own
imagination that Lottie began to listen in spite of herself.  She had been
told that her mamma had wings and a crown, and she had been shown
pictures of ladies in beautiful white nightgowns, who were said to be
angels.  But Sara seemed to be telling a real story about a lovely country
where real people were.</p>
<p>"There are fields and fields of flowers," she said, forgetting
herself, as usual, when she began, and talking rather as if she were in a
dream, "fields and fields of lilies&mdash;and when the soft wind blows over
them it wafts the scent of them into the air&mdash;and everybody always
breathes it, because the soft wind is always blowing.  And little children
run about in the lily fields and gather armfuls of them, and laugh and
make little wreaths.  And the streets are shining.  And people are never
tired, however far they walk.  They can float anywhere they like.  And
there are walls made of pearl and gold all round the city, but they are
low enough for the people to go and lean on them, and look down on to
the earth and smile, and send beautiful messages."</p>
<p>Whatsoever story she had begun to tell, Lottie would, no doubt,
have stopped crying, and been fascinated into listening; but there was no
denying that this story was prettier than most others.  She dragged
herself close to Sara, and drank in every word until the end came&mdash;far
too soon.  When it did come, she was so sorry that she put up her lip
ominously.</p>
<p>"I want to go there," she cried.  "I&mdash;haven't any mamma in this
school."  </p>

<pb n="41"/>
<p>Sara saw the danger signal, and came out of her dream.  She took
hold of the chubby hand and pulled her close to her side with a coaxing
little laugh.</p>
<p>"I will be your mamma," she said.  "We will play that you are my
little girl.  And Emily shall be your sister."</p>
<p>Lottie's dimples all began to show themselves.</p>
<p>"Shall she?" she said.</p>
<p>"Yes," answered Sara, jumping to her feet.  "Let us go and tell
her.  And then I will wash your face and brush your hair."</p>
<p>To which Lottie agreed quite cheerfully, and trotted out of the
room and upstairs with her, without seeming even to remember that the
whole of the last hour's tragedy had been caused by the fact that she had
refused to be washed and brushed for lunch and Miss Minchin had been
called in to use her majestic authority.</p>
<p>And from that time Sara was an adopted mother.   </p>
</div1>


<div1 type="chapter" n="5" id="d9"><pb n="42"/>
<head>Becky</head>
<p>Of course the greatest power Sara possessed and the one which
gained her even more followers than her luxuries and the fact that she
was "the show pupil," the power that Lavinia and certain other girls
were most envious of, and at the same time most fascinated by in spite
of themselves, was her power of telling stories and of making everything
she talked about seem like a story, whether it was one or not.</p>
<p>Anyone who has been at school with a teller of stories knows what
the wonder means&mdash;how he or she is followed about and besought in a
whisper to relate romances; how

<pb n="43"/> groups gather round and hang on the outskirts of the
favored party in the hope of being allowed to join in and listen. Sara not
only could tell stories, but she adored telling them. When she sat or
stood in the midst of a circle and began to invent wonderful things, her
green eyes grew big and shining, her cheeks flushed, and, without
knowing that she was doing it, she began to act and made what she told
lovely or alarming by the raising or dropping of her voice, the bend and
sway of her slim body, and the dramatic movement of her hands.  She
forgot that she was talking to listening children; she saw and lived with
the fairy folk, or the kings and queens and beautiful ladies, whose
adventures she was narrating.  Sometimes when she had finished her
story, she was quite out of breath with excitement, and would lay her
hand on her thin, little, quick-rising chest, and half laugh as if at
herself.</p>
<p>"When I am telling it," she would say, "it doesn't seem as if it
was only made up.  It seems more real than you are&mdash;more real than the
schoolroom.  I feel as if I were all the people in the story&mdash;one after the
other.  It is queer."</p>
<p>She had been at Miss Minchin's school about two years when, one
foggy winter's afternoon, as she was getting out of her carriage,
comfortably wrapped up in her warmest velvets and furs and looking
very much grander than she knew, she caught sight, as she crossed the
pavement, of a dingy little figure standing on the area steps, and
stretching its neck so that its wide-open eyes might peer at her through
the railings.  Something in the eagerness and timidity of the smudgy face
made her look at it, and when she looked she smiled because it was her
way to smile at people.</p>
<p>But the owner of the smudgy face and the wide-open eyes
evidently was afraid that she ought not to have been caught looking at
pupils of importance.  She dodged out of

<pb n="44"/> sight like a jack-in-the-box and scurried back into the
kitchen, disappearing so suddenly that if she had not been such a poor
little forlorn thing, Sara would have laughed in spite of herself.  That
very evening, as Sara was sitting in the midst of a group of listeners in a
corner of the schoolroom telling one of her stories, the very same figure
timidly entered the room, carrying a coal box much too heavy for her,
and knelt down upon the hearth rug to replenish the fire and sweep up
the ashes.</p>
<p>She was cleaner than she had been when she peeped through the
area railings, but she looked just as frightened.  She was evidently afraid
to look at the children or seem to be listening.  She put on pieces of coal
cautiously with her fingers so that she might make no disturbing noise,
and she swept about the fire irons very softly.  But Sara saw in two
minutes that she was deeply interested in what was going on, and that
she was doing her work slowly in the hope of catching a word here and
there.  And realizing this, she raised her voice and spoke more
clearly.</p>
<p>"The Mermaids swam softly about in the crystal-green water, and
dragged after them a fishing-net woven of deep-sea pearls," she said.
"The Princess sat on the white rock and watched them."</p>
<p>It was a wonderful story about a princess who was loved by a
Prince Merman, and went to live with him in shining caves under the
sea.</p>
<p>The small drudge before the grate swept the hearth once and then
swept it again.  Having done it twice, she did it three times; and, as she
was doing it the third time, the sound of the story so lured her to listen
that she fell under the spell and actually forgot that she had no right to
listen at all, and also forgot everything else.  She sat down upon her
heels as she knelt on the hearth rug, and the brush hung idly in her

<pb n="45"/> fingers.  The voice of the storyteller went on and drew
her with it into winding grottos under the sea, glowing with soft, clear
blue light, and paved with pure golden sands.  Strange sea flowers and
grasses waved about her, and far away faint singing and music
echoed.</p>
<p>The hearth brush fell from the work-roughened hand, and Lavinia
Herbert looked round.</p>
<p>"That girl has been listening," she said.</p>
<p>The culprit snatched up her brush, and scrambled to her feet.  She
caught at the coal box and simply scuttled out of the room like a
frightened rabbit.</p>
<p>Sara felt rather hot-tempered.</p>
<p>"I knew she was listening," she said.  "Why shouldn't she?"</p>

<p>Lavinia tossed her head with great elegance.</p>
<p>"Well," she remarked, "I do not know whether your mamma
would like you to tell stories to servant girls, but I know my mamma
wouldn't like me to do it."</p>
<p>"My mamma!" said Sara, looking odd.  "I don't believe she would
mind in the least.  She knows that stories belong to everybody."</p>
<p>"I thought," retorted Lavinia, in severe recollection, that your
mamma was dead.  How can she know things?"</p>
<p>"Do you think she doesn't know things?" said Sara, in her stern
little voice.  Sometimes she had a rather stern little voice.</p>
<p>"Sara's mamma knows everything," piped in Lottie.  "So does my
mamma&mdash;'cept Sara is my mamma at Miss Minchin's&mdash;my other one
knows everything.  The streets are shining, and there are fields and
fields of lilies, and everybody gathers them.  Sara tells me when she puts
me to bed."</p>
<p>"You wicked thing," said Lavinia, turning on Sara; "making fairy
stories about heaven."</p>

<pb n="46"/>
<p>"There are much more splendid stories in Revelation," returned
Sara.  "Just look and see!  How do you know mine are fairy stories?
But I can tell you"&mdash;with a fine bit of unheavenly temper&mdash;"you will
never find out whether they are or not if you're not kinder to people than
you are now.  Come along, Lottie."  And she marched out of the room,
rather hoping that she might see the little servant again somewhere, but
she found no trace of her when she got into the hall.</p>
<p>"Who is that little girl who makes the fires?" she asked Mariette
that night.</p>
<p>Mariette broke forth into a flow of description.</p>
<p>Ah, indeed, Mademoiselle Sara might well ask.  She was a forlorn
little thing who had just taken the place of scullery maid&mdash;though, as to
being scullery maid, she was everything else besides.  She blacked boots
and grates, and carried heavy coal-scuttles up and down stairs, and
scrubbed floors and cleaned windows, and was ordered about by
everybody.  She was fourteen years old, but was so stunted in growth
that she looked about twelve.  In truth, Mariette was sorry for her.  She
was so timid that if one chanced to speak to her it appeared as if her
poor, frightened eyes would jump out of her head.</p>
<p>"What is her name?" asked Sara, who had sat by the table, with
her chin on her hands, as she listened absorbedly to the recital.</p>
<p>Her name was Becky.  Mariette heard everyone belowstairs
calling, "Becky, do this," and "Becky, do that," every five minutes in
the day. </p>
<p>Sara sat and looked into the fire, reflecting on Becky for some
time after Mariette left her.  She made up a story of which Becky was
the ill-used heroine.  She thought she looked as if she had never had
quite enough to eat.  Her very

<pb n="47"/> eyes were hungry.  She hoped she should see her again,
but though she caught sight of her carrying things up or down stairs on
several occasions, she always seemed in such a hurry and so afraid of
being seen that it was impossible to speak to her.</p>
<p>But a few weeks later, on another foggy afternoon, when she
entered her sitting room she found herself confronting a rather pathetic
picture.  In her own special and pet easy-chair before the bright fire,
Becky&mdash;with a coal smudge on her nose and several on her apron, with
her poor little cap hanging half off her head, and an empty coal box on
the floor near her&mdash;sat fast asleep, tired out beyond even the endurance of
her hard-working young body.  She had been sent up to put the
bedrooms in order for the evening.  There were a great many of them,
and she had been running about all day.  Sara's rooms she had saved
until the last.  They were not like the other rooms, which were plain and
bare.  Ordinary pupils were expected to be satisfied with mere
necessaries.  Sara's comfortable sitting room seemed a bower of luxury
to the scullery maid, though it was, in fact, merely a nice, bright little
room.  But there were pictures and books in it, and curious things from
India; there was a sofa and the low, soft chair; Emily sat in a chair of
her own, with the air of a presiding goddess, and there was always a
glowing fire and a polished grate.  Becky saved it until the end of her
afternoon's work, because it rested her to go into it, and she always
hoped to snatch a few minutes to sit down in the soft chair and look
about her, and think about the wonderful good fortune of the child who
owned such surroundings and who went out on the cold days in beautiful
hats and coats one tried to catch a glimpse of through the area
railing.</p>
<p>On this afternoon, when she had sat down, the sensation of relief
to her short, aching legs had been so wonderful and

<pb n="48"/> delightful that it had seemed to soothe her whole body,
and the glow of warmth and comfort from the fire had crept over her
like a spell, until, as she looked at the red coals, a tired, slow smile stole
over her smudged face, her head nodded forward without her being
aware of it, her eyes drooped, and she fell fast asleep.  She had really
been only about ten minutes in the room when Sara entered, but she was
in as deep a sleep as if she had been, like the Sleeping Beauty,
slumbering for a hundred years.  But she did not look&mdash;poor Becky&mdash;like
a Sleeping Beauty at all.  She looked only like an ugly, stunted,
worn-out little scullery drudge.</p>
<p>Sara seemed as much unlike her as if she were a creature from
another world.</p>
<p>On this particular afternoon she had been taking her dancing
lesson, and the afternoon on which the dancing master appeared was
rather a grand occasion at the seminary, though it occurred every week.
The pupils were attired in their prettiest frocks, and as Sara danced
particularly well, she was very much brought forward, and Mariette was
requested to make her as diaphanous and fine as possible.</p>
<p>Today a frock the color of a rose had been put on her, and
Mariette had bought some real buds and made her a wreath to wear on
her black locks.  She had been learning a new, delightful dance in which
she had been skimming and flying about the room, like a large
rose-colored butterfly, and the enjoyment and exercise had brought a
brilliant, happy glow into her face.</p>
<p>When she entered the room, she floated in with a few of the
butterfly steps&mdash;and there sat Becky, nodding her cap sideways off her
head.</p>
<p>"Oh!" cried Sara, softly, when she saw her.  "That poor
thing!"</p>
<p>It did not occur to her to feel cross at finding her pet

<pb n="49"/>


<pb n="50"/> chair occupied by the small, dingy figure.  To tell the
truth, she was quite glad to find it there.  When the ill-used heroine of
her story wakened, she could talk to her.  She crept toward her quietly,
and stood looking at her.  Becky gave a little snore.</p>
<p>"I wish she'd waken herself," Sara said.  "I don't like to waken
her.  But Miss Minchin would be cross if she found out.  I'll just wait a
few minutes."</p>
<p>She took a seat on the edge of the table, and sat swinging her slim,
rose-colored legs, and wondering what it would be best to do.  Miss
Amelia might come in at any moment, and if she did, Becky would be
sure to be scolded.</p>
<p>"But she is so tired," she thought.  "She is so tired!"</p>
<p>A piece of flaming coal ended her perplexity for her that very
moment.  It broke off from a large lump and fell on to the fender.
Becky started, and opened her eyes with a frightened gasp.  She did not
know she had fallen asleep.  She had only sat down for one moment and
felt the beautiful glow&mdash;and here she found herself staring in wild alarm
at the wonderful pupil, who sat perched quite near her, like a
rose-colored fairy, with interested eyes.</p>
<p>She sprang up and clutched at her cap.  She felt it dangling over
her ear, and tried wildly to put it straight.  Oh, she had got herself into
trouble now with a vengeance!  To have impudently fallen asleep on
such a young lady's chair! She would be turned out of doors without
wages.</p>
<p>She made a sound like a big breathless sob.</p>
<p>"Oh, miss!  Oh, miss!" she stuttered.  "I arst yer pardon, miss!
Oh, I do, miss!"</p>
<p>Sara jumped down, and came quite close to her.</p>
<p>"Don't be frightened," she said, quite as if she had been speaking
to a little girl like herself.  "It doesn't matter the least bit."  </p>

<pb n="51"/>
<p>"I didn't go to do it, miss," protested Becky.  "It was the warm
fire&mdash;an' me bein' so tired.  It&mdash;it wasn't imperence!"</p>
<p>Sara broke into a friendly little laugh, and put her hand on her
shoulder.</p>
<p>"You were tired," she said; "you could not help it.  You are not
really awake yet."</p>
<p>How poor Becky stared at her!  In fact, she had never heard such a
nice, friendly sound in anyone's voice before.  She was used to being
ordered about and scolded, and having her ears boxed.  And this one&mdash;in
her rose-colored dancing afternoon splendor&mdash;was looking at her as if she
were not a culprit at all&mdash;as if she had a right to be tired&mdash;even to fall
asleep!  The touch of the soft, slim little paw on her shoulder was the
most amazing thing she had ever known.</p>
<p>"Ain't&mdash;ain't yer angry, miss?" she gasped.  "Ain't yer goin' to tell
the missus?"</p>
<p>"No," cried out Sara.  "Of course I'm not."</p>
<p>The woeful fright in the coal-smutted face made her suddenly so
sorry that she could scarcely bear it.  One of her queer thoughts rushed
into her mind.  She put her hand against Becky's cheek.</p>
<p>"Why," she said, "we are just the same&mdash;I am only a little girl like
you.  It's just an accident that I am not you, and you are not me!"</p>

<p>Becky did not understand in the least.  Her mind could not grasp
such amazing thoughts, and "an accident" meant to her a calamity in
which some one was run over or fell off a ladder and was carried to "the
'orspital."</p>
<p>"A' accident, miss," she fluttered respectfully.  "Is it?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Sara answered, and she looked at her dreamily for a
moment.  But the next she spoke in a different tone.  She realized that
Becky did not know what she meant.  </p>

<pb n="52"/>
<p>"Have you done your work?" she asked.  "Dare you stay here a
few minutes?"</p>
<p>Becky lost her breath again.</p>
<p>"Here, miss?  Me?"</p>
<p>Sara ran to the door, opened it, and looked out and listened.</p>

<p>"No one is anywhere about," she explained.  "If your bedrooms
are finished, perhaps you might stay a tiny while.  I
thought&mdash;perhaps&mdash;you might like a piece of cake."</p>
<p>The next ten minutes seemed to Becky like a sort of delirium.
Sara opened a cupboard, and gave her a thick slice of cake.  She seemed
to rejoice when it was devoured in hungry bites.  She talked and asked
questions, and laughed until Becky's fears actually began to calm
themselves, and she once or twice gathered boldness enough to ask a
question or so herself, daring as she felt it to be.</p>
<p>"Is that&mdash;" she ventured, looking longingly at the rose-colored
frock.  And she asked it almost in a whisper.  "Is that there your
best?"</p>
<p>"It is one of my dancing-frocks," answered Sara.  "I like it, don't
you?"</p>
<p>For a few seconds Becky was almost speechless with admiration.
Then she said in an awed voice, "Onct I see a princess.  I was standin'
in the street with the crowd outside Covin' Garden, watchin' the swells
go inter the operer.  An' there was one everyone stared at most.  They
ses to each other, 'That's the princess.'  She was a growed-up young
lady, but she was pink all over&mdash;gownd an' cloak, an' flowers an' all.  I
called her to mind the minnit I see you, sittin' there on the table, miss.
You looked like her."</p>
<p>"I've often thought," said Sara, in her reflecting voice, "that I
should like to be a princess; I wonder what it feels like.  I believe I will
begin pretending I am one."  </p>

<pb n="53"/>
<p>Becky stared at her admiringly, and, as before, did not understand
her in the least.  She watched her with a sort of adoration.  Very soon
Sara left her reflections and turned to her with a new question.</p>
<p>"Becky," she said, "weren't you listening to that story?"</p>
<p>"Yes, miss," confessed Becky, a little alarmed again.  "I knowed I
hadn't orter, but it was that beautiful I&mdash;I couldn't help it."</p>
<p>"I liked you to listen to it," said Sara.  "If you tell stories, you like
nothing so much as to tell them to people who want to listen.  I don't
know why it is.  Would you like to hear the rest?"</p>
<p>Becky lost her breath again.</p>
<p>"Me hear it?" she cried.  "Like as if I was a pupil, miss! All about
the Prince&mdash;and the little white Mer-babies swimming about
laughing&mdash;with stars in their hair?"</p>
<p>Sara nodded.</p>
<p>"You haven't time to hear it now, I'm afraid," she said; "but if
you will tell me just what time you come to do my rooms, I will try to
be here and tell you a bit of it every day until it is finished.  It's a lovely
long one&mdash;and I'm always putting new bits to it."</p>
<p>"Then," breathed Becky, devoutly, "I wouldn't mind how heavy
the coal boxes was&mdash;or what the cook done to me, if&mdash;if I might have that
to think of."</p>
<p>"You may," said Sara.  "I'll tell it all to you."</p>
<p>When Becky went downstairs, she was not the same Becky who
had staggered up, loaded down by the weight of the coal scuttle.  She
had an extra piece of cake in her pocket, and she had been fed and
warmed, but not only by cake and fire.  Something else had warmed and
fed her, and the something else was Sara.</p>
<p>When she was gone Sara sat on her favorite perch on

<pb n="54"/> the end of her table.  Her feet were on a chair, her
elbows on her knees, and her chin in her hands.</p>
<p>"If I was a princess&mdash;a real princess," she murmured, "I could
scatter largess to the populace.  But even if I am only a pretend princess,
I can invent little things to do for people.  Things like this.  She was just
as happy as if it was largess.  I'll pretend that to do things people like is
scattering largess.  I've scattered largess."  </p>

<head>The Diamond Mines</head>
<p>Not very long after this a very exciting thing happened.  Not only
Sara, but the entire school, found it exciting, and made it the chief
subject of conversation for weeks after it occurred.  In one of his letters
Captain Crewe told a most interesting story.  A friend who had been at
school with him when he was a boy had unexpectedly come to see him
in India.  He was the owner of a large tract of land upon which
diamonds had been found, and he was engaged in developing the mines.
If all went as was confidently expected, he would become possessed of
such wealth as it made one dizzy to think of; and because he was fond of
the friend of his school days, he had given him an opportunity to share
in this enormous

<pb n="56"/> fortune by becoming a partner in his scheme.  This, at
least, was what Sara gathered from his letters.  It is true that any other
business scheme, however magnificent, would have had but small
attraction for her or for the schoolroom; but "diamond mines" sounded
so like the Arabian Nights that no one could be indifferent.  Sara thought
them enchanting, and painted pictures, for Ermengarde and Lottie, of
labyrinthine passages in the bowels of the earth, where sparkling stones
studded the walls and roofs and ceilings, and strange, dark men dug
them out with heavy picks.  Ermengarde delighted in the story, and
Lottie insisted on its being retold to her every evening.  Lavinia was
very spiteful about it, and told Jessie that she didn't believe such things
as diamond mines existed.</p>
<p>"My mamma has a diamond ring which cost forty pounds," she
said.  "And it is not a big one, either.  If there were mines full of
diamonds, people would be so rich it would be ridiculous."</p>
<p>"Perhaps Sara will be so rich that she will be ridiculous," giggled
Jessie.</p>
<p>"She's ridiculous without being rich," Lavinia sniffed.</p>
<p>"I believe you hate her," said Jessie.</p>
<p>"No, I don't," snapped Lavinia.  "But I don't believe in mines full
of diamonds."</p>
<p>"Well, people have to get them from somewhere," said Jessie.
"Lavinia," with a new giggle, "what do you think Gertrude says?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure; and I don't care if it's something more
about that everlasting Sara."</p>
<p>"Well, it is.  One of her 'pretends' is that she is a princess. She
plays it all the time&mdash;even in school.  She says it makes her learn her
lessons better.  She wants Ermengarde to be one, too, but Ermengarde
says she is too fat."  </p>

<pb n="57"/>
<p>"She is too fat," said Lavinia.  "And Sara is too thin."</p>
<p>Naturally, Jessie giggled again.</p>
<p>"She says it has nothing to do with what you look like, or what
you have.  It has only to do with what you think of, and what you
do."</p>
<p>"I suppose she thinks she could be a princess if she was a beggar,"
said Lavinia.  "Let us begin to call her Your Royal Highness."</p>
<p>Lessons for the day were over, and they were sitting before the
schoolroom fire, enjoying the time they liked best.  It was the time when
Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia were taking their tea in the sitting room
sacred to themselves.  At this hour a great deal of talking was done, and
a great many secrets changed hands, particularly if the younger pupils
behaved themselves well, and did not squabble or run about noisily,
which it must be confessed they usually did.  When they made an uproar
the older girls usually interfered with scolding and shakes.  They were
expected to keep order, and there was danger that if they did not, Miss
Minchin or Miss Amelia would appear and put an end to festivities.
Even as Lavinia spoke the door opened and Sara entered with Lottie,
whose habit was to trot everywhere after her like a little dog.</p>
<p>"There she is, with that horrid child!" exclaimed Lavinia in a
whisper.  "If she's so fond of her, why doesn't she keep her in her own
room?  She will begin howling about something in five minutes."</p>

<p>It happened that Lottie had been seized with a sudden desire to
play in the schoolroom, and had begged her adopted parent to come with
her.  She joined a group of little ones who were playing in a corner.
Sara curled herself up in the window-seat, opened a book, and began to
read.  It was a book about the French Revolution, and she was soon lost
in a harrowing picture of the prisoners in the Bastille&mdash;men

<pb n="58"/> who had spent so many years in dungeons that when they
were dragged out by those who rescued them, their long, gray hair and
beards almost hid their faces, and they had forgotten that an outside
world existed at all, and were like beings in a dream.</p>
<p>She was so far away from the schoolroom that it was not agreeable
to be dragged back suddenly by a howl from Lottie.  Never did she find
anything so difficult as to keep herself from losing her temper when she
was suddenly disturbed while absorbed in a book.  People who are fond
of books know the feeling of irritation which sweeps over them at such a
moment.  The temptation to be unreasonable and snappish is one not
easy to manage.</p>
<p>"It makes me feel as if someone had hit me," Sara had told
Ermengarde once in confidence.  "And as if I want to hit back.  I have
to remember things quickly to keep from saying something
ill-tempered."</p>
<p>She had to remember things quickly when she laid her book on the
window-seat and jumped down from her comfortable corner.</p>
<p>Lottie had been sliding across the schoolroom floor, and, having
first irritated Lavinia and Jessie by making a noise, had ended by falling
down and hurting her fat knee.  She was screaming and dancing up and
down in the midst of a group of friends and enemies, who were
alternately coaxing and scolding her.</p>
<p>"Stop this minute, you cry-baby!  Stop this minute!" Lavinia
commanded.</p>
<p>"I'm not a cry-baby . . . I'm not!" wailed Lottle.  "Sara,
Sara!"</p>
<p>"If she doesn't stop, Miss Minchin will hear her," cried Jessie.
"Lottie darling, I'll give you a penny!"</p>
<p>"I don't want your penny," sobbed Lottie; and she looked

<pb n="59"/> down at the fat knee, and, seeing a drop of blood on it,
burst forth again.</p>
<p>Sara flew across the room and, kneeling down, put her arms round
her.</p>
<p>"Now, Lottie," she said.  "Now, Lottie, you promised
Sara."</p>
<p>"She said I was a cry-baby," wept Lottie.</p>
<p>Sara patted her, but spoke in the steady voice Lottie knew.</p>
<p>"But if you cry, you will be one, Lottie pet.  You
promised."</p>
<p>Lottle remembered that she had promised, but she preferred to lift
up her voice.</p>
<p>"I haven't any mamma," she proclaimed.</p>
<p>"Yes, you have," said Sara, cheerfully.  "Have you forgotten?
Don't you know that Sara is your mamma?  Don't you want Sara for
your mamma?"</p>
<p>Lottie cuddled up to her with a consoled sniff.</p>
<p>"Come and sit in the window-seat with me," Sara went on, "and
I'll whisper a story to you."</p>
<p>"Will you?" whimpered Lottie.  "Will you&mdash;tell me&mdash;about the
diamond mines?"</p>
<p>"The diamond mines?" broke out Lavinia.  "Nasty, little spoiled
thing, I should like to slap her!"</p>
<p>Sara got up quickly on her feet.  It must be remembered that she
had been very deeply absorbed in the book about the Bastille, and she
had had to recall several things rapidly when she realized that she must
go and take care of her adopted child.  She was not an angel, and she
was not fond of Lavinia.</p>
<p>"Well," she said, with some fire, "I should like to slap you&mdash;but I
don't want to slap you!" restraining herself.  "At least I both want to
slap you&mdash;and I should like to slap you&mdash;

<pb n="60"/> but I won't slap you.  We are not little gutter children.
We are both old enough to know better."</p>
<p>Here was Lavinia's opportunity.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, your royal highness," she said.  "We are princesses, I
believe.  At least one of us is.  The school ought to be very fashionable
now Miss Minchin has a princess for a pupil."</p>
<p>Sara started toward her.  She looked as if she were going to box
her ears.  Perhaps she was.  Her trick of pretending things was the joy
of her life.  She never spoke of it to girls she was not fond of.  Her new
"pretend" about being a princess was very near to her heart, and she was
shy and sensitive about it.  She had meant it to be rather a secret, and
here was Lavinia deriding it before nearly all the school.  She felt the
blood rush up into her face and tingle in her ears.  She only just saved
herself.  If you were a princess, you did not fly into rages.  Her hand
dropped, and she stood quite still a moment.  When she spoke it was in
a quiet, steady voice; she held her head up, and everybody listened to
her.</p>
<p>"It's true," she said.  "Sometimes I do pretend I am a princess.  I
pretend I am a princess, so that I can try and behave like one."</p>
<p>Lavinia could not think of exactly the right thing to say.  Several
times she had found that she could not think of a satisfactory reply when
she was dealing with Sara.  The reason for this was that, somehow, the
rest always seemed to be vaguely in sympathy with her opponent.  She
saw now that they were pricking up their ears interestedly.  The truth
was, they liked princesses, and they all hoped they might hear something
more definite about this one, and drew nearer Sara accordingly.</p>
<p>Lavinia could only invent one remark, and it fell rather flat.
</p>

<pb n="61"/>
<p>"Dear me," she said, "I hope, when you ascend the throne, you
won't forget us!"</p>
<p>"I won't," said Sara, and she did not utter another word, but stood
quite still, and stared at her steadily as she saw her take Jessie's arm and
turn away.</p>
<p>After this, the girls who were jealous of her used to speak of her
as "Princess Sara" whenever they wished to be particularly disdainful,
and those who were fond of her gave her the name among themselves as
a term of affection.  No one called her "princess" instead of "Sara," but
her adorers were much pleased with the picturesqueness and grandeur of
the title, and Miss Minchin, hearing of it, mentioned it more than once
to visiting parents, feeling that it rather suggested a sort of royal
boarding school.</p>
<p>To Becky it seemed the most appropriate thing in the world.  The
acquaintance begun on the foggy afternoon when she had jumped up
terrified from her sleep in the comfortable chair, had ripened and grown,
though it must be confessed that Miss Minchin and Miss Amelia knew
very little about it. They were aware that Sara was "kind" to the scullery
maid, but they knew nothing of certain delightful moments snatched
perilously when, the upstairs rooms being set in order with lightning
rapidity, Sara's sitting room was reached, and the heavy coal box set
down with a sigh of joy.  At such times stories were told by
installments, things of a satisfying nature were either produced and eaten
or hastily tucked into pockets to be disposed of at night, when Becky
went upstairs to her attic to bed.</p>
<p>"But I has to eat 'em careful, miss," she said once; "'cos if I
leaves crumbs the rats come out to get 'em."</p>
<p>"Rats!" exclaimed Sara, in horror.  "Are there rats there?"</p>
<p>"Lots of 'em, miss," Becky answered in quite a matter-of-fact
manner.  "There mostly is rats an' mice in attics.  You

<pb n="62"/> gets used to the noise they makes scuttling about.  I've
got so I don't mind 'em s' long as they don't run over my piller."</p>

<p>"Ugh!" said Sara.</p>
<p>"You gets used to anythin' after a bit," said Becky.  "You have to,
miss, if you're born a scullery maid.  I'd rather have rats than
cockroaches."</p>
<p>"So would I," said Sara; "I suppose you might make friends with a
rat in time, but I don't believe I should like to make friends with a
cockroach."</p>
<p>Sometimes Becky did not dare to spend more than a few minutes
in the bright, warm room, and when this was the case perhaps only a
few words could be exchanged, and a small purchase slipped into the
old-fashioned pocket Becky carried under her dress skirt, tied round her
waist with a band of tape.  The search for and discovery of satisfying
things to eat which could be packed into small compass, added a new
interest to Sara's existence.  When she drove or walked out, she used to
look into shop windows eagerly.  The first time it occurred to her to
bring home two or three little meat pies, she felt that she had hit upon a
discovery.  When she exhibited them, Becky's eyes quite
sparkled.</p>
<p>"Oh, miss!" she murmured.  "Them will be nice an' fillin.'  It's
fillin'ness that's best.  Sponge cake's a 'evenly thing, but it melts away
like&mdash;if you understand, miss.  These'll just stay in yer
stummick."</p>
<p>"Well," hesitated Sara, "I don't think it would be good if they
stayed always, but I do believe they will be satisfying."</p>
<p>They were satisfying&mdash;and so were beef sandwiches, bought at a
cook-shop&mdash;and so were rolls and Bologna sausage.  In time, Becky
began to lose her hungry, tired feeling, and the coal box did not seem so
unbearably heavy.</p>
<p>However heavy it was, and whatsoever the temper of the cook,
and the hardness of the work heaped upon her

<pb n="63"/> shoulders, she had always the chance of the afternoon to
look forward to&mdash;the chance that Miss Sara would be able to be in her
sitting room.  In fact, the mere seeing of Miss Sara would have been
enough without meat pies.  If there was time only for a few words, they
were always friendly, merry words that put heart into one; and if there
was time for more, then there was an installment of a story to be told, or
some other thing one remembered afterward and sometimes lay awake in
one's bed in the attic to think over.  Sara&mdash;who was only doing what she
unconsciously liked better than anything else, Nature having made her
for a giver&mdash;had not the least idea what she meant to poor Becky, and
how wonderful a benefactor she seemed.  If Nature has made you for a
giver, your hands are born open, and so is your heart; and though there
may be times when your hands are empty, your heart is always full, and
you can give things out of that&mdash;warm things, kind things, sweet
things&mdash;help and comfort and laughter&mdash;and sometimes gay, kind laughter
is the best help of all.</p>
<p>Becky had scarcely known what laughter was through all her poor,
little hard-driven life.  Sara made her laugh, and laughed with her; and,
though neither of them quite knew it, the laughter was as "fillin'" as the
meat pies.</p>
<p>A few weeks before Sara's eleventh birthday a letter came to her
from her father, which did not seem to be written in such boyish high
spirits as usual.  He was not very well, and was evidently overweighted
by the business connected with the diamond mines.</p>
<p>"You see, little Sara," he wrote, "your daddy is not a businessman
at all, and figures and documents bother him.  He does not really
understand them, and all this seems so enormous.  Perhaps, if I was not
feverish I should not be awake, tossing about, one half of the night and
spend the

<pb n="64"/> other half in troublesome dreams.  If my little missus
were here, I dare say she would give me some solemn, good advice.
You would, wouldn't you, Little Missus?"</p>
<p>One of his many jokes had been to call her his "little missus"
because she had such an old-fashioned air.</p>
<p>He had made wonderful preparations for her birthday.  Among
other things, a new doll had been ordered in Paris, and her wardrobe
was to be, indeed, a marvel of splendid perfection.  When she had
replied to the letter asking her if the doll would be an acceptable present,
Sara had been very quaint.</p>
<p>"I am getting very old," she wrote; "you see, I shall never live to
have another doll given me.  This will be my last doll.  There is
something solemn about it.  If I could write poetry, I am sure a poem
about 'A Last Doll' would be very nice.  But I cannot write poetry.  I
have tried, and it made me laugh.  It did not sound like Watts or
Coleridge or Shakespeare at all.  No one could ever take Emily's place,
but I should respect the Last Doll very much; and I am sure the school
would love it.  They all like dolls, though some of the big ones&mdash;the
almost fifteen ones&mdash;pretend they are too grown up."</p>
<p>Captain Crewe had a splitting headache when he read this letter in
his bungalow in India.  The table before him was heaped with papers and
letters which were alarming him and filling him with anxious dread, but
he laughed as he had not laughed for weeks.</p>
<p>"Oh," he said, "she's better fun every year she lives.  God grant
this business may right itself and leave me free to run home and see her.
What wouldn't I give to have her little arms round my neck this minute!
What wouldn't I give!"</p>
<p>The birthday was to be celebrated by great festivities. The
schoolroom was to be decorated, and there was to be a party.  The boxes
containing the presents were to be opened

<pb n="65"/> with great ceremony, and there was to be a glittering
feast spread in Miss Minchin's sacred room.  When the day arrived the
whole house was in a whirl of excitement.  How the morning passed
nobody quite knew, because there seemed such preparations to be made.
The schoolroom was being decked with garlands of holly; the desks had
been moved away, and red covers had been put on the forms which were
arrayed round the room against the wall.</p>
<p>When Sara went into her sitting room in the morning, she found
on the table a small, dumpy package, tied up in a piece of brown paper.
She knew it was a present, and she thought she could guess whom it
came from.  She opened it quite tenderly.  It was a square pincushion,
made of not quite clean red flannel, and black pins had been stuck
carefully into it to form the words, "Menny hapy returns."</p>
<p>"Oh!" cried Sara, with a warm feeling in her heart.  "What pains
she has taken!  I like it so, it&mdash;it makes me feel sorrowful."</p>
<p>But the next moment she was mystified.  On the under side of the
pincushion was secured a card, bearing in neat letters the name "Miss
Amelia Minchin."</p>
<p>Sara turned it over and over.</p>
<p>"Miss Amelia!" she said to herself "How can it be!"</p>
<p>And just at that very moment she heard the door being cautiously
pushed open and saw Becky peeping round it.</p>
<p>There was an affectionate, happy grin on her face, and she
shuffled forward and stood nervously pulling at her fingers.</p>
<p>"Do yer like it, Miss Sara?" she said.  "Do yer?"</p>
<p>"Like it?" cried Sara.  "You darling Becky, you made it all
yourself."</p>
<p>Becky gave a hysteric but joyful sniff, and her eyes looked quite
moist with delight.</p>
<p>"It ain't nothin' but flannin, an' the flannin ain't new;

<pb n="66"/> but I wanted to give yer somethin' an' I made it of
nights.  I knew yer could pretend it was satin with diamond pins in.  I
tried to when I was makin' it.  The card, miss," rather doubtfully; "'t
warn't wrong of me to pick it up out o' the dust-bin, was it?  Miss
'Meliar had throwed it away.  I hadn't no card o' my own, an' I knowed
it wouldn't be a proper presink if I didn't pin a card on&mdash;so I pinned
Miss 'Meliar's."</p>
<p>Sara flew at her and hugged her.  She could not have told herself
or anyone else why there was a lump in her throat.</p>
<p>"Oh, Becky!" she cried out, with a queer little laugh, "I love you,
Becky&mdash;I do, I do!"</p>
<p>"Oh, miss!" breathed Becky.  "Thank yer, miss, kindly; it ain't
good enough for that.  The&mdash;the flannin wasn't new."</p>

</div1>

<div1 type="chapter" n="7" id="d11"><pb n="67"/>
<head>The Diamond Mines Again</head>
<p>When Sara entered the holly-hung schoolroom in the afternoon,
she did so as the head of a sort of procession.  Miss Minchin, in her
grandest silk dress, led her by the hand.  A manservant followed,
carrying the box containing the Last Doll, a housemaid carried a second
box, and Becky brought up the rear, carrying a third and wearing a clean
apron and a new cap.  Sara would have much preferred to enter in the
usual way, but Miss Minchin had sent for her, and, after an interview in
her private sitting room, had expressed her wishes.</p>
<p>"This is not an ordinary occasion," she said.  "I do not desire that
it should be treated as one."</p>
<p>So Sara was led grandly in and felt shy when, on her

<pb n="68"/> entry, the big girls stared at her and touched each other's
elbows, and the little ones began to squirm joyously in their seats.</p>

<p>"Silence, young ladies!" said Miss Minchin, at the murmur which
arose.  "James, place the box on the table and remove the lid.  Emma,
put yours upon a chair.  Becky!" suddenly and severely.</p>
<p>Becky had quite forgotten herself in her excitement, and was
grinning at Lottie, who was wriggling with rapturous expectation.  She
almost dropped her box, the disapproving voice so startled her, and her
frightened, bobbing curtsy of apology was so funny that Lavinia and
Jessie tittered.</p>
<p>"It is not your place to look at the young ladies," said Miss
Minchin.  "You forget yourself.  Put your box down."</p>
<p>Becky obeyed with alarmed haste and hastily backed toward the
door.</p>
<p>"You may leave us," Miss Minchin announced to the servants with
a wave of her hand.</p>
<p>Becky stepped aside respectfully to allow the superior servants to
pass out first.  She could not help casting a longing glance at the box on
the table.  Something made of blue satin was peeping from between the
folds of tissue paper.</p>
<p>"If you please, Miss Minchin," said Sara, suddenly, "mayn't
Becky stay?"</p>
<p>It was a bold thing to do.  Miss Minchin was betrayed into
something like a slight jump. Then she put her eyeglass up, and gazed at
her show pupil disturbedly.</p>
<p>"Becky!" she exclaimed.  "My dearest Sara!"</p>
<p>Sara advanced a step toward her.</p>
<p>"I want her because I know she will like to see the presents," she
explained.  "She is a little girl, too, you know."</p>
<p>Miss Minchin was scandalized.  She glanced from one figure to the
other.  </p>

<pb n="69"/>
<p>"My dear Sara," she said, "Becky is the scullery maid.  Scullery
maids&mdash;er&mdash;are not little girls."</p>
<p>It really had not occurred to her to think of them in that light.
Scullery maids were machines who carried coal scuttles and made
fires.</p>
<p>"But Becky is," said Sara.  "And I know she would enjoy herself.
Please let her stay&mdash;because it is my birthday."</p>
<p>Miss Minchin replied with much dignity:</p>
<p>"As you ask it as a birthday favor&mdash;she may stay.  Rebecca, thank
Miss Sara for her great kindness."</p>
<p>Becky had been backing into the corner, twisting the hem of her
apron in delighted suspense.  She came forward, bobbing curtsies, but
between Sara's eyes and her own there passed a gleam of friendly
understanding, while her words tumbled over each other.</p>
<p>"Oh, if you please, miss!  I'm that grateful, miss!  I did want to
see the doll, miss, that I did.  Thank you, miss.  And thank you,
ma'am,"&mdash;turning and making an alarmed bob to Miss Minchin&mdash;"for
letting me take the liberty."</p>
<p>Miss Minchin waved her hand again&mdash;this time it was in the
direction of the corner near the door.</p>
<p>"Go and stand there," she commanded.  "Not too near the young
ladies."</p>
<p>Becky went to her place, grinning.  She did not care where she
was sent, so that she might have the luck of being inside the room,
instead of being downstairs in the scullery, while these delights were
going on.  She did not even mind when Miss Minchin cleared her throat
ominously and spoke again.</p>
<p>"Now, young ladies, I have a few words to say to you," she
announced.</p>
<p>"She's going to make a speech," whispered one of the girls.  "I
wish it was over."</p>

<pb n="70"/>
<p>Sara felt rather uncomfortable.  As this was her party, it was
probable that the speech was about her.  It is not agreeable to stand in a
schoolroom and have a speech made about you.</p>
<p>"You are aware, young ladies," the speech began&mdash;for it was a
speech&mdash;"that dear Sara is eleven years old today."</p>
<p>"Dear Sara!" murmured Lavinia.</p>
<p>"Several of you here have also been eleven years old, but Sara's
birthdays are rather different from other little girls' birthdays.  When she
is older she will be heiress to a large fortune, which it will be her duty
to spend in a meritorious manner."</p>
<p>"The diamond mines," giggled Jessie, in a whisper.</p>
<p>Sara did not hear her; but as she stood with her green-gray eyes
fixed steadily on Miss Minchin, she felt herself growing rather hot.
When Miss Minchin talked about money, she felt somehow that she
always hated her&mdash;and, of course, it was disrespectful to hate grown-up
people.</p>
<p>"When her dear papa, Captain Crewe, brought her from India and
gave her into my care," the speech proceeded, "he said to me, in a
jesting way, 'I am afraid she will be very rich, Miss Minchin.'  My
reply was, 'Her education at my seminary, Captain Crewe, shall be such
as will adorn the largest fortune.'  Sara has become my most
accomplished pupil.  Her French and her dancing are a credit to the
seminary.  Her manners&mdash;which have caused you to call her Princess
Sara&mdash;are perfect.  Her amiability she exhibits by giving you this
afternoon's party.  I hope you appreciate her generosity.  I wish you to
express your appreciation of it by saying aloud all together, 'Thank you,
Sara!'"</p>
<p>The entire schoolroom rose to its feet as it had done the morning
Sara remembered so well.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Sara!" it said, and it must be confessed that Lottie
jumped up and down.  Sara looked rather shy for

<pb n="71"/> a moment.  She made a curtsy&mdash;and it was a very nice
one.</p>
<p>"Thank you," she said, "for coming to my party."</p>
<p>"Very pretty, indeed, Sara," approved Miss Minchin.  "That is
what a real princess does when the populace applauds her.
Lavinia"&mdash;scathingly&mdash;"the sound you just made was extremely like a
snort.  If you are jealous of your fellow-pupil, I beg you will express
your feelings in some more ladylike manner.  Now I will leave you to
enjoy yourselves."</p>
<p>The instant she had swept out of the room the spell her presence
always had upon them was broken.  The door had scarcely closed before
every seat was empty.  The little girls jumped or tumbled out of theirs;
the older ones wasted no time in deserting theirs.  There was a rush
toward the boxes.  Sara had bent over one of them with a delighted
face.</p>
<p>"These are books, I know," she said.</p>
<p>The little children broke into a rueful murmur, and Ermengarde
looked aghast.</p>
<p>"Does your papa send you books for a birthday present?" she
exclaimed.  "Why, he's as bad as mine.  Don't open them, Sara."</p>

<p>"I like them," Sara laughed, but she turned to the biggest box.
When she took out the Last Doll it was so magnificent that the children
uttered delighted groans of joy, and actually drew back to gaze at it in
breathless rapture.</p>
<p>"She is almost as big as Lottie," someone gasped.</p>
<p>Lottie clapped her hands and danced about, giggling.</p>
<p>"She's dressed for the theater," said Lavinia.  "Her cloak is lined
with ermine."</p>
<p>"Oh," cried Ermengarde, darting forward, "she has an opera-glass
in her hand&mdash;a blue-and-gold one!"</p>
<p>"Here is her trunk," said Sara.  "Let us open it and look at her
things."</p>
<p>She sat down upon the floor and turned the key.  The

<pb n="72"/> children crowded clamoring around her, as she lifted tray
after tray and revealed their contents.  Never had the schoolroom been in
such an uproar.  There were lace collars and silk stockings and
handkerchiefs; there was a jewel case containing a necklace and a tiara
which looked quite as if they were made of real diamonds; there was a
long sealskin and muff, there were ball dresses and walking dresses and
visiting dresses; there were hats and tea gowns and fans.  Even Lavinia
and Jessie forgot that they were too elderly to care for dolls, and uttered
exclamations of delight and caught up things to look at them.</p>
<p>"Suppose," Sara said, as she stood by the table, putting a large,
black-velvet hat on the impassively smiling owner of all these
splendors&mdash;"suppose she understands human talk and feels proud of being
admired."</p>
<p>"You are always supposing things," said Lavinia, and her air was
very superior.</p>
<p>"I know I am," answered Sara, undisturbedly.  "I like it.  There is
nothing so nice as supposing.  It's almost like being a fairy.  If you
suppose anything hard enough it seems as if it were real."</p>
<p>"It's all very well to suppose things if you have everything," said
Lavinia.  "Could you suppose and pretend if you were a beggar and
lived in a garret?"</p>
<p>Sara stopped arranging the Last Doll's ostrich plumes, and looked
thoughtful.</p>
<p>"I believe I could," she said.  "If one was a beggar, one would
have to suppose and pretend all the time.  But it mightn't be
easy."</p>
<p>She often thought afterward how strange it was that just as she had
finished saying this&mdash;just at that very moment&mdash;Miss Amelia came into the
room.</p>
<p>"Sara," she said, "your papa's solicitor, Mr. Barrow,

<pb n="73"/> has called to see Miss Minchin, and, as she must talk to
him alone and the refreshments are laid in her parlor, you had all better
come and have your feast now, so that my sister can have her interview
here in the schoolroom."</p>
<p>Refreshments were not likely to be disdained at any hour, and
many pairs of eyes gleamed.  Miss Amelia arranged the procession into
decorum, and then, with Sara at her side heading it, she led it away,
leaving the Last Doll sitting upon a chair with the glories of her
wardrobe scattered about her; dresses and coats hung upon chair backs,
piles of lace-frilled petticoats lying upon their seats.</p>
<p>Becky, who was not expected to partake of refreshments, had the
indiscretion to linger a moment to look at these beauties&mdash;it really was an
indiscretion.</p>
<p>"Go back to your work, Becky," Miss Amelia had said; but she
had stopped to pick up reverently first a muff and then a coat, and while
she stood looking at them adoringly, she heard Miss Minchin upon the
threshold, and, being smitten with terror at the thought of being accused
of taking liberties, she rashly darted under the table, which hid her by its
tablecloth.</p>
<p>Miss Minchin came into the room, accompanied by a
sharp-featured, dry little gentleman, who looked rather disturbed.  Miss
Minchin herself also looked rather disturbed, it must be admitted, and
she gazed at the dry little gentleman with an irritated and puzzled
expression.</p>
<p>She sat down with stiff dignity, and waved him to a chair.</p>
<p>"Pray, be seated, Mr. Barrow," she said.</p>
<p>Mr. Barrow did not sit down at once.  His attention seemed
attracted by the Last Doll and the things which surrounded her.  He
settled his eyeglasses and looked at them in nervous disapproval.  The
Last Doll herself did not seem

<pb n="74"/> to mind this in the least.  She merely sat upright and
returned his gaze indifferently.</p>
<p>"A hundred pounds," Mr. Barrow remarked succinctly.  "All
expensive material, and made at a Parisian modiste's.  He spent money
lavishly enough, that young man."</p>
<p>Miss Minchin felt offended.  This seemed to be a disparagement of
her best patron and was a liberty.</p>
<p>Even solicitors had no right to take liberties.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, Mr. Barrow," she said stiffly.  "I do not
understand."</p>
<p>"Birthday presents," said Mr. Barrow in the same critical manner,
"to a child eleven years old!  Mad extravagance, I call it."</p>
<p>Miss Minchin drew herself up still more rigidly.</p>
<p>"Captain Crewe is a man of fortune," she said.  "The diamond
mines alone&mdash;"</p>
<p>Mr. Barrow wheeled round upon her.  "Diamond mines!" he broke
out.  "There are none!  Never were!"</p>
<p>Miss Minchin actually got up from her chair.</p>
<p>"What!" she cried.  "What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"At any rate," answered Mr. Barrow, quite snappishly, "it would
have been much better if there never had been any."</p>
<p>"Any diamond mines?" ejaculated Miss Minchin, catching at the
back of a chair and feeling as if a splendid dream was fading away from
her.</p>
<p>"Diamond mines spell ruin oftener than they spell wealth," said
Mr. Barrow.  "When a man is in the hands of a very dear friend and is
not a businessman himself, he had better steer clear of the dear friend's
diamond mines, or gold mines, or any other kind of mines dear friends
want his money to put into.  The late Captain Crewe&mdash;"</p>
<p>Here Miss Minchin stopped him with a gasp.  </p>

<pb n="75"/>
<p>"The late Captain Crewe!" she cried out.  "The late!  You don't
come to tell me that Captain Crewe is&mdash;"</p>
<p>"He's dead, ma'am," Mr. Barrow answered with jerky
brusqueness.  "Died of jungle fever and business troubles combined.
The jungle fever might not have killed him if he had not been driven
mad by the business troubles, and the business troubles might not have
put an end to him if the jungle fever had not assisted.  Captain Crewe is
dead!"</p>
<p>Miss Minchin dropped into her chair again.  The words he had
spoken filled her with alarm.</p>
<p>"What were his business troubles?" she said.  "What were
they?"</p>
<p>"Diamond mines," answered Mr. Barrow, "and dear friends&mdash;and
ruin."</p>
<p>Miss Minchin lost her breath.</p>
<p>"Ruin!" she gasped out.</p>
<p>"Lost every penny.  That young man had too much money.  The
dear friend was mad on the subject of the diamond mine.  He put all his
own money into it, and all Captain Crewe's.  Then the dear friend ran
away&mdash;Captain Crewe was already stricken with fever when the news
came.  The shock was too much for him.  He died delirious, raving
about his little girl&mdash;and didn't leave a penny."</p>
<p>Now Miss Minchin understood, and never had she received such a
blow in her life.  Her show pupil, her show patron, swept away from the
Select Seminary at one blow.  She felt as if she had been outraged and
robbed, and that Captain Crewe and Sara and Mr. Barrow were equally
to blame.</p>
<p>"Do you mean to tell me," she cried out, "that he left nothing!
That Sara will have no fortune!  That the child is a beggar!  That she is
left on my hands a little pauper instead of an heiress?"  </p>

<pb n="76"/>
<p>Mr. Barrow was a shrewd businessman, and felt it as well to make
his own freedom from responsibility quite clear without any delay.</p>

<p>"She is certainly left a beggar," he replied.  "And she is certainly
left on your hands, ma'am&mdash;as she hasn't a relation in the world that we
know of."</p>
<p>Miss Minchin started forward.  She looked as if she was going to
open the door and rush out of the room to stop the festivities going on
joyfully and rather noisily that moment over the refreshments.</p>
<p>"It is monstrous!" she said.  "She's in my sitting room at this
moment, dressed in silk gauze and lace petticoats, giving a party at my
expense."</p>
<p>"She's giving it at your expense, madam, if she's giving it," said
Mr. Barrow, calmly.  "Barrow &amp; Skipworth are not responsible for
anything.  There never was a cleaner sweep made of a man's fortune.
Captain Crewe died without paying our last bill&mdash;and it was a big
one."</p>
<p>Miss Minchin turned back from the door in increased indignation.
This was worse than anyone could have dreamed of its being.</p>
<p>"That is what has happened to me!" she cried.  "I was always so
sure of his payments that I went to all sorts of ridiculous expenses for
the child.  I paid the bills for that ridiculous doll and her ridiculous
fantastic wardrobe.  The child was to have anything she wanted.  She
has a carriage and a pony and a maid, and I've paid for all of them since
the last cheque came."</p>
<p>Mr. Barrow evidently did not intend to remain to listen to the story
of Miss Minchin's grievances after he had made the position of his firm
clear and related the mere dry facts.  He did not feel any particular
sympathy for irate keepers of boarding schools.  </p>

<pb n="77"/>
<p>"You had better not pay for anything more, ma'am," he remarked,
"unless you want to make presents to the young lady.  No one will
remember you.  She hasn't a brass farthing to call her own."</p>
<p>"But what am I to do?" demanded Miss Minchin, as if she felt it
entirely his duty to make the matter right.  "What am I to do?"</p>
<p>"There isn't anything to do," said Mr. Barrow, folding up his
eyeglasses and slipping them into his pocket.  "Captain Crewe is dead.
The child is left a pauper.  Nobody is responsible for her but
you."</p>
<p>"I am not responsible for her, and I refuse to be made
responsible!"</p>
<p>Miss Minchin became quite white with rage.</p>
<p>Mr. Barrow turned to go.</p>
<p>"I have nothing to do with that, madam," he said uninterestedly.
"Barrow &amp; Skipworth are not responsible.  Very sorry the thing has
happened, of course."</p>
<p>"If you think she is to be foisted off on me, you are greatly
mistaken," Miss Minchin gasped.  "I have been robbed and cheated; I
will turn her into the street!"</p>
<p>If she had not been so furious, she would have been too discreet to
say quite so much.  She saw herself burdened with an extravagantly
brought-up child whom she had always resented, and she lost all
self-control.</p>
<p>Mr. Barrow undisturbedly moved toward the door.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't do that, madam," he commented; "it wouldn't look
well.  Unpleasant story to get about in connection with the establishment.
Pupil bundled out penniless and without friends."</p>
<p>He was a clever business man, and he knew what he was saying.
He also knew that Miss Minchin was a business woman, and would be
shrewd enough to see the truth.  She

<pb n="78"/> could not afford to do a thing which would make people
speak of her as cruel and hard-hearted.</p>
<p>" Better keep her and make use of her," he added.  "She's a clever
child, I believe.  You can get a good deal out of her as she grows
older."</p>
<p>"I will get a good deal out of her before she grows older!"
exclaimed Miss Minchin.</p>
<p>"I am sure you will, ma'am," said Mr. Barrow, with a little
sinister smile.  "I am sure you will.  Good morning!"</p>
<p>He bowed himself out and closed the door, and it must be
confessed that Miss Minchin stood for a few moments and glared at it.
What he had said was quite true.  She knew it.  She had absolutely no
redress.  Her show pupil had melted into nothingness, leaving only a
friendless, beggared little girl.  Such money as she herself had advanced
was lost and could not be regained.</p>
<p>And as she stood there breathless under her sense of injury, there
fell upon her ears a burst of gay voices from her own sacred room,
which had actually been given up to the feast.  She could at least stop
this.</p>
<p>But as she started toward the door it was opened by Miss Amelia,
who, when she caught sight of the changed, angry face, fell back a step
in alarm.</p>
<p>"What is the matter, sister?" she ejaculated.</p>
<p>Miss Minchin's voice was almost fierce when she answered:</p>

<p>"Where is Sara Crewe?"</p>
<p>Miss Amelia was bewildered.</p>
<p>"Sara!" she stammered.  "Why, she's with the children in your
room, of course."</p>
<p>"Has she a black frock in her sumptuous wardrobe?"&mdash;in bitter
irony.</p>
<p>"A black frock?" Miss Amelia stammered again.  "A black
one?"</p>
<pb n="79"/>
<p>"She has frocks of every other color.  Has she a black
one?"</p>
<p>Miss Amelia began to turn pale.</p>
<p>"No&mdash;ye-es!" she said.  "But it is too short for her.  She has only
the old black velvet, and she has outgrown it."</p>
<p>"Go and tell her to take off that preposterous pink silk gauze, and
put the black one on, whether it is too short or not.  She has done with
finery!"</p>
<p>Then Miss Amelia began to wring her fat hands and cry.</p>
<p>"Oh, sister!" she sniffed.  "Oh, sister!  What can have
happened?"</p>
<p>Miss Minchin wasted no words.</p>
<p>"Captain Crewe is dead," she said.  "He has died without a penny.
That spoiled, pampered, fanciful child is left a pauper on my
hands."</p>
<p>Miss Amelia sat down quite heavily in the nearest chair.</p>
<p>"Hundreds of pounds have I spent on nonsense for her.  And I
shall never see a penny of it.  Put a stop to this ridiculous party of hers.
Go and make her change her frock at once."</p>
<p>"I?" panted Miss Amelia.  "M-must I go and tell her now?"</p>

<p>"This moment!" was the fierce answer.  "Don't sit staring like a
goose.  Go!"</p>
<p>Poor Miss Amelia was accustomed to being called a goose.  She
knew, in fact, that she was rather a goose, and that it was left to geese to
do a great many disagreeable things.  It was a somewhat embarrassing
thing to go into the midst of a room full of delighted children, and tell
the giver of the feast that she had suddenly been transformed into a little
beggar, and must go upstairs and put on an old black frock which was
too small for her.  But the thing must be done.  This was evidently not
the time when questions might be asked.</p>
<p>She rubbed her eyes with her handkerchief until they

<pb n="80"/> looked quite red.  After which she got up and went out
of the room, without venturing to say another word.  When her older
sister looked and spoke as she had done just now, the wisest course to
pursue was to obey orders without any comment.  Miss Minchin walked
across the room.  She spoke to herself aloud without knowing that she
was doing it.  During the last year the story of the diamond mines had
suggested all sorts of possibilities to her.  Even proprietors of seminaries
might make fortunes in stocks, with the aid of owners of mines.  And
now, instead of looking forward to gains, she was left to look back upon
losses.</p>
<p>" The Princess Sara, indeed!" she said.  "The child has been
pampered as if she were a queen."</p>
<p>She was sweeping angrily past the corner table as she said it, and
the next moment she started at the sound of a loud, sobbing sniff which
issued from under the cover.</p>
<p>"What is that!" she exclaimed angrily.  The loud, sobbing sniff
was heard again, and she stooped and raised the hanging folds of the
table cover.</p>
<p>"How dare you!" she cried out.  "How dare you!  Come out
immediately!"</p>
<p>It was poor Becky who crawled out, and her cap was knocked on
one side, and her face was red with repressed crying.</p>
<p>"If you please, 'm&mdash;it's me, mum," she explained.  "I know I
hadn't ought to.  But I was lookin' at the doll, mum&mdash;an' I was
frightened when you come in&mdash;an' slipped under the table."</p>
<p>"You have been there all the time, listening," said Miss
Minchin.</p>
<p>"No, mum," Becky protested, bobbing curtsies.  "Not listenin'&mdash;I
thought I could slip out without your noticin', but I couldn't an' I had to
stay.  But I didn't listen, mum&mdash;I wouldn't for nothin'.  But I couldn't
help hearin'."  </p>

<pb n="81"/>
<p>Suddenly it seemed almost as if she lost all fear of the awful lady
before her.  She burst into fresh tears.</p>
<p>"Oh, please, 'm," she said; "I dare say you'll give me warnin,
mum&mdash;but I'm so sorry for poor Miss Sara&mdash;I'm so sorry!"</p>
<p>"Leave the room!" ordered Miss Minchin.</p>
<p>Becky curtsied again, the tears openly streaming down her
cheeks.</p>
<p>"Yes, 'm; I will, 'm," she said, trembling; "but oh, I just wanted
to arst you: Miss Sara&mdash;she's been such a rich young lady, an' she's been
waited on, 'and and foot; an' what will she do now, mum, without no
maid?  If&mdash;if, oh please, would you let me wait on her after I've done my
pots an' kettles?  I'd do 'em that quick&mdash;if you'd let me wait on her now
she's poor.  Oh," breaking out afresh, "poor little Miss Sara, mum&mdash;that
was called a princess."</p>
<p>Somehow, she made Miss Minchin feel more angry than ever.
That the very scullery maid should range herself on the side of this
child&mdash;whom she realized more fully than ever that she had never
liked&mdash;was too much.  She actually stamped her foot.</p>
<p>"No&mdash;certainly not," she said.  "She will wait on herself, and on
other people, too.  Leave the room this instant, or you'll leave your
place."</p>
<p>Becky threw her apron over her head and fled.  She ran out of the
room and down the steps into the scullery, and there she sat down
among her pots and kettles, and wept as if her heart would break.</p>

<p>"It's exactly like the ones in the stories," she wailed.  "Them pore
princess ones that was drove into the world."</p>
<p>Miss Minchin had never looked quite so still and hard as she did
when Sara came to her, a few hours later, in response to a message she
had sent her.  </p>

<pb n="82"/>
<p>Even by that time it seemed to Sara as if the birthday party had
either been a dream or a thing which had happened years ago, and had
happened in the life of quite another little girl.</p>
<p>Every sign of the festivities had been swept away; the holly had
been removed from the schoolroom walls, and the forms and desks put
back into their places.  Miss Minchin's sitting room looked as it always
did&mdash;all traces of the feast were gone, and Miss Minchin had resumed her
usual dress.  The pupils had been ordered to lay aside their party frocks;
and this having been done, they had returned to the schoolroom and
huddled together in groups, whispering and talking excitedly.</p>
<p>"Tell Sara to come to my room," Miss Minchin had said to her
sister.  "And explain to her clearly that I will have no crying or
unpleasant scenes."</p>
<p>"Sister," replied Miss Amelia, "she is the strangest child I ever
saw.  She has actually made no fuss at all.  You remember she made
none when Captain Crewe went back to India.  When I told her what had
happened, she just stood quite still and looked at me without making a
sound.  Her eyes seemed to get bigger and bigger, and she went quite
pale.  When I had finished, she still stood staring for a few seconds, and
then her chin began to shake, and she turned round and ran out of the
room and upstairs.  Several of the other children began to cry, but she
did not seem to hear them or to be alive to anything but just what I was
saying.  It made me feel quite queer not to be answered; and when you
tell anything sudden and strange, you expect people will say
something&mdash;whatever it is."</p>
<p>Nobody but Sara herself ever knew what had happened in her
room after she had run upstairs and locked her door.  In fact, she herself
scarcely remembered anything but that

<pb n="83"/> she walked up and down, saying over and over again to
herself in a voice which did not seem her own, "My papa is dead!  My
papa is dead!"</p>
<p>Once she stopped before Emily, who sat watching her from her
chair, and cried out wildly, "Emily!  Do you hear? Do you hear&mdash;papa is
dead?  He is dead in India&mdash;thousands of miles away."</p>
<p>When she came into Miss Minchin's sitting room in answer to her
summons, her face was white and her eyes had dark rings around them.
Her mouth was set as if she did not wish it to reveal what she had
suffered and was suffering.  She did not look in the least like the
rose-colored butterfly child who had flown about from one of her
treasures to the other in the decorated schoolroom.  She looked instead a
strange, desolate, almost grotesque little figure.</p>
<p>She had put on, without Mariette's help, the cast-aside black-velvet
frock.  It was too short and tight, and her slender legs looked long and
thin, showing themselves from beneath the brief skirt.  As she had not
found a piece of black ribbon, her short, thick, black hair tumbled
loosely about her face and contrasted strongly with its pallor.  She held
Emily tightly in one arm, and Emily was swathed in a piece of black
material.</p>
<p>"Put down your doll," said Miss Minchin.  "What do you mean by
bringing her here?"</p>
<p>"No," Sara answered.  "I will not put her down.  She is all I have.
My papa gave her to me."</p>
<p>She had always made Miss Minchin feel secretly uncomfortable,
and she did so now.  She did not speak with rudeness so much as with a
cold steadiness with which Miss Minchin felt it difficult to cope&mdash;perhaps
because she knew she was doing a heartless and inhuman thing.</p>
<p>"You will have no time for dolls in future," she said.

<pb n="84"/> "You will have to work and improve yourself and make
yourself useful."</p>
<p>Sara kept her big, strange eyes fixed on her, and said not a
word.</p>
<p>"Everything will be very different now," Miss Minchin went on.
"I suppose Miss Amelia has explained matters to you."</p>
<p>"Yes," answered Sara.  "My papa is dead.  He left me no money.
I am quite poor."</p>
<p>"You are a beggar," said Miss Minchin, her temper rising at the
recollection of what all this meant.  "It appears that you have no
relations and no home, and no one to take care of you."</p>
<p>For a moment the thin, pale little face twitched, but Sara again
said nothing.</p>
<p>"What are you staring at?" demanded Miss Minchin, sharply.
"Are you so stupid that you cannot understand?  I tell you that you are
quite alone in the world, and have no one to do anything for you, unless
I choose to keep you here out of charity."</p>
<p>"I understand," answered Sara, in a low tone; and there was a
sound as if she had gulped down something which rose in her throat.  "I
understand."</p>
<p>"That doll," cried Miss Minchin, pointing to the splendid birthday
gift seated near&mdash;"that ridiculous doll, with all her nonsensical,
extravagant things&mdash;I actually paid the bill for her!"</p>
<p>Sara turned her head toward the chair.</p>
<p>"The Last Doll," she said.  "The Last Doll."  And her little
mournful voice had an odd sound.</p>
<p>"The Last Doll, indeed!" said Miss Minchin.  "And she is mine,
not yours.  Everything you own is mine."</p>
<p>"Please take it away from me, then," said Sara.  "I do not want
it."  </p>

<pb n="85"/>
<p>If she had cried and sobbed and seemed frightened, Miss Minchin
might almost have had more patience with her.  She was a woman who
liked to domineer and feel her power, and as she looked at Sara's pale
little steadfast face and heard her proud little voice, she quite felt as if
her might was being set at naught.</p>
<p>"Don't put on grand airs," she said.  "The time for that sort of
thing is past.  You are not a princess any longer.  Your carriage and
your pony will be sent away&mdash;your maid will be dismissed.  You will
wear your oldest and plainest clothes&mdash;your extravagant ones are no
longer suited to your station.  You are like Becky&mdash;you must work for
your living."</p>
<p>To her surprise, a faint gleam of light came into the child's eyes&mdash;a
shade of relief.</p>
<p>"Can I work?" she said.  "If I can work it will not matter so
much.  What can I do?"</p>
<p>"You can do anything you are told," was the answer.  "You are a
sharp child, and pick up things readily.  If you make yourself useful I
may let you stay here.  You speak French well, and you can help with
the younger children."</p>
<p>"May I?" exclaimed Sara.  "Oh, please let me!  I know I can teach
them.  I like them, and they like me."</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense about people liking you," said Miss Minchin.
"You will have to do more than teach the little ones.  You will run
errands and help in the kitchen as well as in the schoolroom.  If you
don't please me, you will be sent away.  Remember that.  Now
go."</p>
<p>Sara stood still just a moment, looking at her.  In her young soul,
she was thinking deep and strange things.  Then she turned to leave the
room.</p>
<p>"Stop!" said Miss Minchin.  "Don't you intend to thank
me?"</p>
<p>Sara paused, and all the deep, strange thoughts surged up in her
breast.  </p>

<pb n="86"/>
<p>"What for?" she said.</p>
<p>"For my kindness to you," replied Miss Minchin.  "For my
kindness in giving you a home."</p>
<p>Sara made two or three steps toward her.  Her thin little chest
heaved up and down, and she spoke in a strange unchildishly fierce
way.</p>
<p>"You are not kind," she said.  "You are not kind, and it is not a
home."  And she had turned and run out of the room before Miss
Minchin could stop her or do anything but stare after her with stony
anger.</p>
<p>She went up the stairs slowly, but panting for breath and she held
Emily tightly against her side.</p>
<p>"I wish she could talk," she said to herself.  "If she could speak&mdash;if
she could speak!"</p>
<p>She meant to go to her room and lie down on the tiger-skin, with
her cheek upon the great cat's head, and look into the fire and think and
think and think.  But just before she reached the landing Miss Amelia
came out of the door and closed it behind her, and stood before it,
looking nervous and awkward.  The truth was that she felt secretly
ashamed of the thing she had been ordered to do.</p>
<p>"You&mdash;you are not to go in there," she said.</p>
<p>"Not go in?" exclaimed Sara, and she fell back a pace.</p>
<p>"That is not your room now," Miss Amelia answered, reddening a
little.</p>
<p>Somehow, all at once, Sara understood.  She realized that this was
the beginning of the change Miss Minchin had spoken of.</p>
<p>"Where is my room?" she asked, hoping very much that her voice
did not shake.</p>
<p>"You are to sleep in the attic next to Becky."</p>
<p>Sara knew where it was.  Becky had told her about it.  She turned,
and mounted up two flights of stairs.  The last

<pb n="88"/> one was narrow, and covered with shabby strips of old
carpet.  She felt as if she were walking away and leaving far behind her
the world in which that other child, who no longer seemed herself, had
lived.  This child, in her short, tight old frock, climbing the stairs to the
attic, was quite a different creature.</p>
<p>When she reached the attic door and opened it, her heart gave a
dreary little thump.  Then she shut the door and stood against it and
looked about her.</p>
<p>Yes, this was another world.  The room had a slanting roof and
was whitewashed.  The whitewash was dingy and had fallen off in
places.  There was a rusty grate, an old iron bedstead, and a hard bed
covered with a faded coverlet.  Some pieces of furniture too much worn
to be used downstairs had been sent up.  Under the skylight in the roof,
which showed nothing but an oblong piece of dull gray sky, there stood
an old battered red footstool.  Sara went to it and sat down.  She seldom
cried.  She did not cry now.  She laid Emily across her knees and put
her face down upon her and her arms around her, and sat there, her little
black head resting on the black draperies, not saying one word, not
making one sound.</p>
<p>And as she sat in this silence there came a low tap at the
door&mdash;such a low, humble one that she did not at first hear it, and,
indeed, was not roused until the door was timidly pushed open and a
poor tear-smeared face appeared peeping round it.  It was Becky's face,
and Becky had been crying furtively for hours and rubbing her eyes with
her kitchen apron until she looked strange indeed.</p>
<p>"Oh, miss," she said under her breath.  "Might I&mdash;would you allow
me&mdash;jest to come in?"</p>
<p>Sara lifted her head and looked at her.  She tried to begin a smile,
and somehow she could not.  Suddenly&mdash;and it was all through the loving
mournfulness of Becky's streaming

<pb n="89"/> eyes&mdash;her face looked more like a child's not so much too
old for her years.  She held out her hand and gave a little sob.</p>
<p>"Oh, Becky," she said.  "I told you we were just the same&mdash;only
two little girls&mdash;just two little girls.  You see how true it is.  There's no
difference now.  I'm not a princess anymore."</p>
<p>Becky ran to her and caught her hand, and hugged it to her breast,
kneeling beside her and sobbing with love and pain.</p>
<p>"Yes, miss, you are," she cried, and her words were all broken.
"Whats'ever 'appens to you&mdash;whats'ever&mdash;you'd be a princess all the
same&mdash;an' nothin' couldn't make you nothin' different."   </p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="8" id="d12"><pb n="90"/>
<head>In the Attic</head>
<p>The first night she spent in her attic was a thing Sara never forgot.
During its passing she lived through a wild, unchildlike woe of which
she never spoke to anyone about her.  There was no one who would
have understood.  It was, indeed, well for her that as she lay awake in
the darkness her mind was forcibly distracted, now and then, by the
strangeness of her surroundings.  It was, perhaps, well for her that she
was reminded by her small body of material things.  If this had not been
so, the anguish of her young mind might have been too great for a child
to bear.  But, really, while the night was passing she scarcely knew that
she had a body at all or remembered any other thing than one.</p>
<p>"My papa is dead!" she kept whispering to herself. "My papa is
dead!"</p>
<p>It was not until long afterward that she realized that her bed had
been so hard that she turned over and over in it to find a place to rest,
that the darkness seemed more intense than any she had ever known, and
that the wind howled

<pb n="91"/> over the roof among the chimneys like something which
wailed aloud.  Then there was something worse.  This was certain
scufflings and scratchings and squeakings in the walls and behind the
skirting boards.  She knew what they meant, because Becky had
described them.  They meant rats and mice who were either fighting
with each other
or playing together.  Once or twice she even heard sharp-toed feet
scurrying across the floor, and she remembered in those after days, when
she recalled things, that when first she heard them she started up in bed
and sat trembling, and when she lay down again covered her head with
the bedclothes.</p>
<p>The change in her life did not come about gradually, but was made
all at once.</p>
<p>"She must begin as she is to go on," Miss Minchin said to Miss
Amelia.  "She must be taught at once what she is to expect."</p>
<p>Mariette had left the house the next morning.  The glimpse Sara
caught of her sitting room, as she passed its open door, showed her that
everything had been changed.  Her ornaments and luxuries had been
removed, and a bed had been placed in a corner to transform it into a
new pupil's bedroom.</p>
<p>When she went down to breakfast she saw that her seat at Miss
Minchin's side was occupied by Lavinia, and Miss Minchin spoke to her
coldly.</p>
<p>"You will begin your new duties, Sara," she said, "by taking your
seat with the younger children at a smaller table.  You must keep them
quiet, and see that they behave well and do not waste their food.  You
ought to have been down earlier.  Lottie has already upset her
tea."</p>
<p>That was the beginning, and from day to day the duties given to
her were added to.  She taught the younger children French and heard
their other lessons, and these were the least of her labors.  It was found
that she could be made use of in

<pb n="92"/> numberless directions.  She could be sent on errands at
any time and in all weathers.  She could be told to do things other
people neglected.  The cook and the housemaids took their tone from
Miss Minchin, and rather enjoyed ordering about the "young one" who
had been made so much fuss over for so long.  They were not servants
of the best class, and had neither good manners nor good tempers, and it
was frequently convenient to have at hand someone on whom blame
could be laid.</p>
<p>During the first month or two, Sara thought that her willingness to
do things as well as she could, and her silence under reproof, might
soften those who drove her so hard.  In her proud little heart she wanted
them to see that she was trying to earn her living and not accepting
charity.  But the time came when she saw that no one was softened at
all; and the more willing she was to do as she was told, the more
domineering and exacting careless housemaids became, and the more
ready a scolding cook was to blame her.</p>
<p>If she had been older, Miss Minchin would have given her the
bigger girls to teach and saved money by dismissing an instructress; but
while she remained and looked like a child, she could be made more
useful as a sort of little superior errand girl and maid of all work.  An
ordinary errand boy would not have been so clever and reliable.  Sara
could be trusted with difficult commissions and complicated messages.
She could even go and pay bills, and she combined with this the ability
to dust a room well and to set things in order.</p>
<p>Her own lessons became things of the past.  She was taught
nothing, and only after long and busy days spent in running here and
there at everybody's orders was she grudgingly allowed to go into the
deserted schoolroom, with a pile of old books, and study alone at
night.</p>

<pb n="93"/>
<p>"If I do not remind myself of the things I have learned, perhaps I
may forget them," she said to herself.  "I am almost a scullery maid,
and if I am a scullery maid who knows nothing, I shall be like poor
Becky.  I wonder if I could quite forget and begin to drop my h's and
not remember that Henry the Eighth had six wives."</p>
<p>One of the most curious things in her new existence was her
changed position among the pupils.  Instead of being a sort of small
royal personage among them, she no longer seemed to be one of their
number at all.  She was kept so constantly at work that she scarcely ever
had an opportunity of speaking to any of them, and she could not avoid
seeing that Miss Minchin preferred that she should live a life apart from
that of the occupants of the schoolroom.</p>
<p>"I will not have her forming intimacies and talking to the other
children," that lady said.  "Girls like a grievance, and if she begins to
tell romantic stories about herself, she will become an ill-used heroine,
and parents will be given a wrong impression.  It is better that she
should live a separate life&mdash;one suited to her circumstances.  I am giving
her a home, and that is more than she has any right to expect from
me."</p>
<p>Sara did not expect much, and was far too proud to try to continue
to be intimate with girls who evidently felt rather awkward and uncertain
about her.  The fact was that Miss Minchin's pupils were a set of dull,
matter-of-fact young people.  They were accustomed to being rich and
comfortable, and as Sara's frocks grew shorter and shabbier and
queerer-looking, and it became an established fact that she wore shoes
with holes in them and was sent out to buy groceries and carry them
through the streets in a basket on her arm when the cook wanted them in
a hurry, they felt rather as if, when they spoke to her, they were
addressing an under servant.  </p>

<pb n="94"/>
<p>"To think that she was the girl with the diamond mines, Lavinia
commented.  "She does look an object.  And she's queerer than ever.  I
never liked her much, but I can't bear that way she has now of looking
at people without speaking&mdash;just as if she was finding them out."</p>
<p>"I am," said Sara, promptly, when she heard of this.  "That's what
I look at some people for.  I like to know about them.  I think them over
afterward."</p>
<p>The truth was that she had saved herself annoyance several times
by keeping her eye on Lavinia, who was quite ready to make mischief,
and would have been rather pleased to have made it for the ex-show
pupil.</p>
<p>Sara never made any mischief herself, or interfered with anyone.
She worked like a drudge; she tramped through the wet streets, carrying
parcels and baskets; she labored with the childish inattention of the little
ones' French lessons; as she became shabbier and more forlorn-looking,
she was told that she had better take her meals downstairs; she was
treated as if she was nobody's concern, and her heart grew proud and
sore, but she never told anyone what she felt.</p>
<p>"Soldiers don't complain," she would say between her small, shut
teeth, "I am not going to do it; I will pretend this is part of a
war."</p>
<p>But there were hours when her child heart might almost have
broken with loneliness but for three people.</p>
<p>The first, it must be owned, was Becky&mdash;just Becky.  Throughout
all that first night spent in the garret, she had felt a vague comfort in
knowing that on the other side of the wall in which the rats scuffled and
squeaked there was another young human creature.  And during the
nights that followed the sense of comfort grew.  They had little chance
to speak to each other during the day.  Each had her own tasks to
perform, and any attempt at conversation would

<pb n="95"/>  have been regarded as a tendency to loiter and lose
time. "Don't mind me, miss," Becky whispered during the first morning,
"if I don't say nothin' polite.  Some un'd be down on us if I did.  I
means 'please' an' 'thank you' an' 'beg pardon,' but I dassn't to take
time to say it."</p>
<p>But before daybreak she used to slip into Sara's attic and button
her dress and give her such help as she required before she went
downstairs to light the kitchen fire.  And when night came Sara always
heard the humble knock at her door which meant that her handmaid was
ready to help her again if she was needed.  During the first weeks of her
grief Sara felt as if she were too stupefied to talk, so it happened that
some time passed before they saw each other much or exchanged visits.
Becky's heart told her that it was best that people in trouble should be
left alone.</p>
<p>The second of the trio of comforters was Ermengarde, but odd
things happened before Ermengarde found her place.</p>
<p>When Sara's mind seemed to awaken again to the life about her,
she realized that she had forgotten that an Ermengarde lived in the
world.  The two had always been friends, but Sara had felt as if she
were years the older.  It could not be contested that Ermengarde was as
dull as she was affectionate.  She clung to Sara in a simple, helpless
way; she brought her lessons to her that she might be helped; she
listened to her every word and besieged her with requests for stories.
But she had nothing interesting to say herself, and she loathed books of
every description.  She was, in fact, not a person one would remember
when one was caught in the storm of a great trouble, and Sara forgot
her.</p>
<p>It had been all the easier to forget her because she had been
suddenly called home for a few weeks.  When she came back she did not
see Sara for a day or two, and when she met her for the first time she
encountered her coming down

<pb n="96"/> a corridor with her arms full of garments which were to
be taken downstairs to be mended.  Sara herself had already been taught
to mend them.  She looked pale and unlike herself, and she was attired
in the queer, outgrown frock whose shortness showed so much thin black
leg.</p>
<p>Ermengarde was too slow a girl to be equal to such a situation.
She could not think of anything to say.  She knew what had happened,
but, somehow, she had never imagined Sara could look like this&mdash;so odd
and poor and almost like a servant.  It made her quite miserable, and she
could do nothing but break into a short hysterical laugh and
exclaim&mdash;aimlessly and as if without any meaning, "Oh, Sara, is that
you?"</p>
<p>" Yes," answered Sara, and suddenly a strange thought passed
through her mind and made her face flush.  She held the pile of
garments in her arms, and her chin rested upon the top of it to keep it
steady.  Something in the look of her straight-gazing eyes made
Ermengarde lose her wits still more.  She felt as if Sara had changed
into a new kind of girl, and she had never known her before.  Perhaps it
was because she had suddenly grown poor and had to mend things and
work like Becky.</p>
<p>"Oh," she stammered.  "How&mdash;how are you?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," Sara replied.  "How are you?"</p>
<p>"I'm&mdash;I'm quite well," said Ermengarde, overwhelmed with
shyness.  Then spasmodically she thought of something to say which
seemed more intimate.  "Are you&mdash;are you very unhappy?" she said in a
rush.</p>
<p>Then Sara was guilty of an injustice.  Just at that moment her torn
heart swelled within her, and she felt that if anyone was as stupid as
that, one had better get away from her.</p>
<p>"What do you think?" she said.  "Do you think I am

<pb n="97"/>  very happy?"  And she marched past her without
another word.</p>
<p>In course of time she realized that if her wretchedness had not
made her forget things, she would have known that poor, dull
Ermengarde was not to be blamed for her unready, awkward ways.  She
was always awkward, and the more she felt, the more stupid she was
given to being.</p>
<p>But the sudden thought which had flashed upon her had made her
over-sensitive.</p>
<p>"She is like the others," she had thought.  "She does not really
want to talk to me.  She knows no one does."</p>
<p>So for several weeks a barrier stood between them.  When they
met by chance Sara looked the other way, and Ermengarde felt too stiff
and embarrassed to speak.  Sometimes they nodded to each other in
passing, but there were times when they did not even exchange a
greeting.</p>
<p>"If she would rather not talk to me," Sara thought, "I will keep out
of her way.  Miss Minchin makes that easy enough."</p>
<p>Miss Minchin made it so easy that at last they scarcely saw each
other at all.  At that time it was noticed that Ermengarde was more
stupid than ever, and that she looked listless and unhappy.  She used to
sit in the window-seat, huddled in a heap, and stare out of the window
without speaking.  Once Jessie, who was passing, stopped to look at her
curiously.</p>
<p>"What are you crying for, Ermengarde?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I'm not crying," answered Ermengarde, in a muffled, unsteady
voice.</p>
<p>"You are," said Jessie.  "A great big tear just rolled down the
bridge of your nose and dropped off at the end of it.  And there goes
another."</p>
<p>"Well," said Ermengarde, "I'm miserable&mdash;and no one

<pb n="98"/> need interfere."  And she turned her plump back and
took out her handkerchief and boldly hid her face in it.</p>
<p>That night, when Sara went to her attic, she was later than usual.
She had been kept at work until after the hour at which the pupils went
to bed, and after that she had gone to her lessons in the lonely
schoolroom.  When she reached the top of the stairs, she was surprised
to see a glimmer of light coming from under the attic door.</p>
<p>"Nobody goes there but myself," she thought quickly, "but
someone has lighted a candle."</p>
<p>Someone had, indeed, lighted a candle, and it was not burning in
the kitchen candlestick she was expected to use, but in one of those
belonging to the pupils' bedrooms.  The someone was sitting upon the
battered footstool, and was dressed in her nightgown and wrapped up in
a red shawl.  It was Ermengarde.</p>
<p>"Ermengarde!" cried Sara.  She was so startled that she was almost
frightened.  "You will get into trouble."</p>
<p>Ermengarde stumbled up from her footstool.  She shuffled across
the attic in her bedroom slippers, which were too large for her.  Her
eyes and nose were pink with crying.</p>
<p>"I know I shall&mdash;if I'm found out." she said.  "But I don't care&mdash;I
don't care a bit.  Oh, Sara, please tell me.  What is the matter?  Why
don't you like me any more?"</p>
<p>Something in her voice made the familiar lump rise in Sara's
throat.  It was so affectionate and simple&mdash;so like the old Ermengarde
who had asked her to be "best friends."  It sounded as if she had not
meant what she had seemed to mean during these past weeks.</p>
<p>"I do like you," Sara answered.  "I thought&mdash;you see, everything is
different now.  I thought you&mdash;were different.</p>
<p>Ermengarde opened her wet eyes wide. </p>
<p>"Why, it was you who were different!" she cried.  "You

<pb n="99"/>  didn't want to talk to me.  I didn't know what to do.  It
was you who were different after I came back."</p>
<p>Sara thought a moment.  She saw she had made a mistake.</p>
<p>"I am different," she explained, "though not in the way you think.
Miss Minchin does not want me to talk to the girls.  Most of them don't
want to talk to me.  I thought&mdash;perhaps&mdash;you didn't.  So I tried to keep
out of your way."</p>
<p>"Oh, Sara," Ermengarde almost wailed in her reproachful dismay.
And then after one more look they rushed into each other's arms.  It
must be confessed that Sara's small black head lay for some minutes on
the shoulder covered by the red shawl.  When Ermengarde had seemed
to desert her, she had felt horribly lonely.</p>
<p>Afterward they sat down upon the floor together, Sara clasping her
knees with her arms, and Ermengarde rolled up in her shawl.
Ermengarde looked at the odd, big-eyed little face adoringly.</p>
<p>"I couldn't bear it any more," she said.  "I dare say you could live
without me, Sara; but I couldn't live without you.  I was nearly dead.
So tonight, when I was crying under the bedclothes, I thought all at once
of creeping up here and just begging you to let us be friends
again."</p>
<p>"You are nicer than I am," said Sara.  "I was too proud to try and
make friends.  You see, now that trials have come, they have shown that
I am not a nice child.  I was afraid they would.  Perhaps"&mdash;wrinkling her
forehead wisely&mdash;"that is what they were sent for."</p>
<p>"I don't see any good in them," said Ermengarde stoutly.</p>
<p>"Neither do I&mdash;to speak the truth," admitted Sara, frankly.  "But I
suppose there might be good in things, even if we don't see it.  There
might"&mdash;doubtfully&mdash;"be good in Miss Minchin."  </p>

<pb n="100"/>
<p>Ermengarde looked round the attic with a rather fearsome
curiosity.</p>
<p>"Sara," she said, "do you think you can bear living here?"</p>
<p>Sara looked round also.</p>
<p>"If I pretend it's quite different, I can," she answered; "or if I
pretend it is a place in a story."</p>
<p>She spoke slowly.  Her imagination was beginning to work for
her.  It had not worked for her at all since her troubles had come upon
her.  She had felt as if it had been stunned.</p>
<p>"Other people have lived in worse places.  Think of the Count of
Monte Cristo in the dungeons of the Chateau d'If.  And think of the
people in the Bastille!"</p>
<p>"The Bastille," half whispered Ermengarde, watching her and
beginning to be fascinated.  She remembered stories of the French
Revolution which Sara had been able to fix in her mind by her dramatic
relation of them.  No one but Sara could have done it.</p>
<p>A well-known glow came into Sara's eyes.</p>
<p>"Yes," she said, hugging her knees, "that will be a good place to
pretend about.  I am a prisoner in the Bastille.  I have been here for
years and years&mdash;and years; and everybody has forgotten about me.  Miss
Minchin is the jailer&mdash;and Becky"&mdash;a sudden light adding itself to the
glow in her eyes&mdash;"Becky is the prisoner in the next cell."</p>
<p>She turned to Ermengarde, looking quite like the old Sara.</p>
<p>"I shall pretend that," she said; "and it will be a great
comfort."</p>
<p>Ermengarde was at once enraptured and awed.</p>
<p>"And will you tell me all about it?" she said.  "May I creep up
here at night, whenever it is safe, and hear the things

<pb n="101"/>  you have made up in the day?  It will seem as if we
were more 'best friends' than ever."</p>
<p>"Yes," answered Sara, nodding.  "Adversity tries people, and mine
has tried you and proved how nice you are."  </p>

</div1>

<div1 type="chapter" n="9" id="d13"><pb n="102"/>
<head>Melchisedec</head>
<p>The third person in the trio was Lottie.  She was a small thing and
did not know what adversity meant, and was much bewildered by the
alteration she saw in her young adopted mother.  She had heard it
rumored that strange things had happened to Sara, but she could not
understand why she looked different&mdash;why she wore an old black frock
and came into the schoolroom only to teach instead of to sit in her place
of honor and learn lessons herself.  There had been much whispering
among the little ones when it had been discovered that Sara no longer
lived in the rooms in which Emily had so long sat in state.  Lottie's chief
difficulty was that Sara said so little when one asked her questions.  At
seven mysteries must be made very clear if one is to understand
them.</p>
<p>"Are you very poor now, Sara?" she had asked confidentially the
first morning her friend took charge of the small French class.  "Are you
as poor as a beggar?"  She thrust a fat hand into the slim one and opened
round, tearful eyes.  "I don't want you to be as poor as a
beggar."</p>

<pb n="103"/>
<p>She looked as if she was going to cry.  And Sara hurriedly
consoled her.</p>
<p>"Beggars have nowhere to live," she said courageously.  "I have a
place to live in."</p>
<p>"Where do you live?" persisted Lottle.  "The new girl sleeps in
your room, and it isn't pretty any more."</p>
<p>"I live in another room," said Sara.</p>
<p>"Is it a nice one?" inquired Lottie.  "I want to go and see
it."</p>
<p>"You must not talk," said Sara.  "Miss Minchin is looking at us.
She will be angry with me for letting you whisper."</p>
<p>She had found out already that she was to be held accountable for
everything which was objected to.  If the children were not attentive, if
they talked, if they were restless, it was she who would be
reproved.</p>
<p>But Lottie was a determined little person.  If Sara would not tell
her where she lived, she would find out in some other way.  She talked
to her small companions and hung about the elder girls and listened
when they were gossiping; and acting upon certain information they had
unconsciously let drop, she started late one afternoon on a voyage of
discovery, climbing stairs she had never known the existence of, until
she reached the attic floor.  There she found two doors near each other,
and opening one, she saw her beloved Sara standing upon an old table
and looking out of a window.</p>
<p>"Sara!" she cried, aghast.  "Mamma Sara!"  She was aghast
because the attic was so bare and ugly and seemed so far away from all
the world.  Her short legs had seemed to have been mounting hundreds
of stairs.</p>
<p>Sara turned round at the sound of her voice.  It was her turn to be
aghast.  What would happen now?  If Lottie began to cry and any one
chanced to hear, they were both lost.  She jumped down from her table
and ran to the child.  </p>

<pb n="104"/>
<p>"Don't cry and make a noise," she implored.  "I shall be scolded
if you do, and I have been scolded all day.  It's&mdash;it's not such a bad
room, Lottie."</p>
<p>"Isn't it?" gasped Lottie, and as she looked round it she bit her lip.
She was a spoiled child yet, but she was fond enough of her adopted
parent to make an effort to control herself for her sake.  Then,
somehow, it was quite possible that any place in which Sara lived might
turn out to be nice.  "Why isn't it, Sara?" she almost whispered.</p>
<p>Sara hugged her close and tried to laugh.  There was a sort of
comfort in the warmth of the plump, childish body.  She had had a hard
day and had been staring out of the windows with hot eyes.</p>
<p>"You can see all sorts of things you can't see downstairs," she
said.</p>
<p>"What sort of things?" demanded Lottie, with that cunosity Sara
could always awaken even in bigger girls.</p>
<p>"Chimneys&mdash;quite close to us&mdash;with smoke curling up in wreaths
and clouds and going up into the sky&mdash;and sparrows hopping about and
talking to each other just as if they were people&mdash;and other attic windows
where heads may pop out any minute and you can wonder who they
belong to.  And it all feels as high up&mdash;as if it was another
world."</p>
<p>"Oh, let me see it!" cried Lottie.  "Lift me up!"</p>
<p>Sara lifted her up, and they stood on the old table together and
leaned on the edge of the flat window in the roof, and looked out.</p>

<p>Anyone who has not done this does not know what a different
world they saw.  The slates spread out on either side of them and slanted
down into the rain gutter-pipes.  The sparrows, being at home there,
twittered and hopped about quite without fear.  Two of them perched on
the chimney top nearest and quarrelled with each other fiercely until one
pecked the other and drove him away.  The garret window

<pb n="105"/> next to theirs was shut because the house next door was
empty.</p>
<p>"I wish someone lived there," Sara said.  "It is so close that if
there was a little girl in the attic, we could talk to each other through the
windows and climb over to see each other, if we were not afraid of
falling."</p>
<p>The sky seemed so much nearer than when one saw it from the
street, that Lottie was enchanted.  From the attic window, among the
chimney pots, the things which were happening in the world below
seemed almost unreal.  One scarcely believed in the existence of Miss
Minchin and Miss Amelia and the schoolroom, and the roll of wheels in
the square seemed a sound belonging to another existence.</p>
<p>"Oh, Sara!" cried Lottie, cuddling in her guarding arm.  "I like
this attic&mdash;I like it!  It is nicer than downstairs!"</p>
<p>"Look at that sparrow," whispered Sara.  "I wish I had some
crumbs to throw to him."</p>
<p>"I have some!" came in a little shriek from Lottie.  "I have part of
a bun in my pocket; I bought it with my penny yesterday, and I saved a
bit."</p>
<p>When they threw out a few crumbs the sparrow jumped and flew
away to an adjacent chimney top.  He was evidently not accustomed to
intimates in attics, and unexpected crumbs startled him.  But when Lottie
remained quite still and Sara chirped very softly&mdash;almost as if she were a
sparrow herself&mdash;he saw that the thing which had alarmed him
represented hospitality, after all.  He put his head on one side, and from
his perch on the chimney looked down at the crumbs with twinkling
eyes.  Lottie could scarcely keep still.</p>
<p>"Will he come?  Will he come?" she whispered.</p>
<p>"His eyes look as if he would," Sara whispered back.  "He is
thinking and thinking whether he dare.  Yes, he will! Yes, he is
coming!"  </p>

<pb n="106"/>
<p>He flew down and hopped toward the crumbs, but stopped a few
inches away from them, putting his head on one side again, as if
reflecting on the chances that Sara and Lottie might turn out to be big
cats and jump on him.  At last his heart told him they were really nicer
than they looked, and he hopped nearer and nearer, darted at the biggest
crumb with a lightning peck, seized it, and carried it away to the other
side of his chimney.</p>
<p>"Now he knows," said Sara.  "And he will come back for the
others."</p>
<p>He did come back, and even brought a friend, and the friend went
away and brought a relative, and among them they made a hearty meal
over which they twittered and chattered and exclaimed, stopping every
now and then to put their heads on one side and examine Lottie and
Sara.  Lottie was so delighted that she quite forgot her first shocked
impression of the attic.  In fact, when she was lifted down from the table
and returned to earthly things, as it were, Sara was able to point out to
her many beauties in the room which she herself would not have
suspected the existence of.</p>
<p>"It is so little and so high above everything," she said, "that it is
almost like a nest in a tree.  The slanting ceiling is so funny.  See, you
can scarcely stand up at this end of the room; and when the morning
begins to come I can lie in bed and look right up into the sky through
that flat window in the roof.  It is like a square patch of light.  If the sun
is going to shine, little pink clouds float about, and I feel as if I could
touch them.  And if it rains, the drops patter and patter as if they were
saying something nice.  Then if there are stars, you can lie and try to
count how many go into the patch.  It takes such a lot.  And just look at
that tiny, rusty grate in the corner.  If it was polished and there was a
fire in it, just

<pb n="107"/> think how nice it would be.  You see, it's really a
beautiful little room."</p>
<p>She was walking round the small place, holding Lottie's hand and
making gestures which described all the beauties she was making herself
see.  She quite made Lottie see them, too.  Lottie could always believe
in the things Sara made pictures of.</p>
<p>"You see," she said, "there could be a thick, soft blue Indian rug
on the floor; and in that corner there could be a soft little sofa, with
cushions to curl up on; and just over it could be a shelf full of books so
that one could reach them easily; and there could be a fur rug before the
fire, and hangings on the wall to cover up the whitewash, and pictures.
They would have to be little ones, but they could be beautiful; and there
could be a lamp with a deep rose-colored shade; and a table in the
middle, with things to have tea with; and a little fat copper kettle singing
on the hob; and the bed could be quite different.  It could be made soft
and covered with a lovely silk coverlet.  It could be beautiful.  And
perhaps we could coax the sparrows until we made such friends with
them that they would come and peck at the window and ask to be let
in."</p>
<p>"Oh, Sara!" cried Lottie.  "I should like to live here!"</p>
<p>When Sara had persuaded her to go downstairs again, and, after
setting her on her way, had come back to her attic, she stood in the
middle of it and looked about her.  The enchantment of her imaginings
for Lottie had died away.  The bed was hard and covered with its dingy
quilt.  The whitewashed wall showed its broken patches, the floor was
cold and bare, the grate was broken and rusty, and the battered footstool,
tilted sideways on its injured leg, the only seat in the room.  She sat
down on it for a few minutes and let her head drop in her hands.  The
mere fact that Lottie had

<pb n="108"/> come and gone away again made things seem a little
worse&mdash;just as perhaps prisoners feel a little more desolate after visitors
come and go, leaving them behind.</p>
<p>"It's a lonely place," she said.  "Sometimes it's the loneliest place
in the world."</p>
<p>She was sitting in this way when her attention was attracted by a
slight sound near her.  She lifted her head to see where it came from,
and if she had been a nervous child she would have left her seat on the
battered footstool in a great hurry.  A large rat was sitting up on his hind
quarters and sniffing the air in an interested manner.  Some of Lottie's
crumbs had dropped upon the floor and their scent had drawn him out of
his hole.</p>
<p>He looked so queer and so like a gray-whiskered dwarf or gnome
that Sara was rather fascinated.  He looked at her with his bright eyes,
as if he were asking a question.  He was evidently so doubtful that one
of the child's queer thoughts came into her mind.</p>
<p>"I dare say it is rather hard to be a rat," she mused.  "Nobody
likes you.  People jump and run away and scream out, 'Oh, a horrid
rat!'  I shouldn't like people to scream and jump and say, 'Oh, a horrid
Sara!' the moment they saw me.  And set traps for me, and pretend they
were dinner.  It's so different to be a sparrow.  But nobody asked this
rat if he wanted to be a rat when he was made.  Nobody said, 'Wouldn't
you rather be a sparrow?'"</p>
<p>She had sat so quietly that the rat had begun to take courage.  He
was very much afraid of her, but perhaps he had a heart like the sparrow
and it told him that she was not a thing which pounced.  He was very
hungry.  He had a wife and a large family in the wall, and they had had
frightfully bad luck for several days.  He had left the children crying
bitterly, and felt he would risk a good deal for a few crumbs, so he
cautiously dropped upon his feet.  </p>

<pb n="109"/>
<p>"Come on," said Sara; "I'm not a trap.  You can have them, poor
thing!  Prisoners in the Bastille used to make friends with rats.  Suppose
I make friends with you."</p>
<p>How it is that animals understand things I do not know, but it is
certain that they do understand.  Perhaps there is a language which is not
made of words and everything in the world understands it.  Perhaps
there is a soul hidden in everything and it can always speak, without
even making a sound, to another soul.  But whatsoever was the reason,
the rat knew from that moment that he was safe&mdash;even though he was a
rat.  He knew that this young human being sitting on the red footstool
would not jump up and terrify him with wild, sharp noises or throw
heavy objects at him which, if they did not fall and crush him, would
send him limping in his scurry back to his hole.  He was really a very
nice rat, and did not mean the least harm.  When he had stood on his
hind legs and sniffed the air, with his bright eyes fixed on Sara, he had
hoped that she would understand this, and would not begin by hating him
as an enemy.  When the mysterious thing which speaks without saying
any words told him that she would not, he went softly toward the crumbs
and began to eat them.  As he did it he glanced every now and then at
Sara, just as the sparrows had done, and his expression was so very
apologetic that it touched her heart.</p>
<p>She sat and watched him without making any movement.  One
crumb was very much larger than the others&mdash;in fact, it could scarcely be
called a crumb.  It was evident that he wanted that piece very much, but
it lay quite near the footstool and he was still rather timid.</p>
<p>"I believe he wants it to carry to his family in the wall," Sara
thought.  "If I do not stir at all, perhaps he will come and get it."</p>

<p>She scarcely allowed herself to breathe, she was so deeply
interested.  The rat shuffled a little nearer and ate a few more

<pb n="110"/>
<pb n="111"/> crumbs, then he stopped and sniffed delicately, giving a
side glance at the occupant of the footstool; then he darted at the piece of
bun with something very like the sudden boldness of the sparrow, and
the instant he had possession of it fled back to the wall, slipped down a
crack in the skirting board, and was gone.</p>
<p>"I knew he wanted it for his children," said Sara.  "I do believe I
could make friends with him."</p>
<p>A week or so afterward, on one of the rare nights when
Ermengarde found it safe to steal up to the attic, when she tapped on the
door with the tips of her fingers Sara did not come to her for two or
three minutes.  There was, indeed, such a silence in the room at first
that Ermengarde wondered if she could have fallen asleep.  Then, to her
surprise, she heard her utter a little, low laugh and speak coaxingly to
someone.</p>
<p>"There!" Ermengarde heard her say.  "Take it and go home,
Melchisedec!  Go home to your wife!"</p>
<p>Almost immediately Sara opened the door, and when she did so
she found Ermengarde standing with alarmed eyes upon the
threshold.</p>
<p>"Who&mdash;who are you talking to, Sara?" she gasped out.</p>
<p>Sara drew her in cautiously, but she looked as if something pleased
and amused her.</p>
<p>"You must promise not to be frightened&mdash;not to scream the least
bit, or I can't tell you," she answered.</p>
<p>Ermengarde felt almost inclined to scream on the spot, but
managed to control herself.  She looked all round the attic and saw no
one.  And yet Sara had certainly been speaking to someone.  She thought
of ghosts.</p>
<p>"Is it&mdash;something that will frighten me?" she asked
timorously.</p>
<p>"Some people are afraid of them," said Sara.  "I was at first&mdash;but I
am not now."  </p>

<pb n="112"/>
<p>"Was it&mdash;a ghost?" quaked Ermengarde.</p>
<p>"No," said Sara, laughing.  "It was my rat."</p>
<p>Ermengarde made one bound, and landed in the middle of the little
dingy bed.  She tucked her feet under her nightgown and the red shawl.
She did not scream, but she gasped with fright.</p>
<p>"Oh!  Oh!" she cried under her breath.  "A rat!  A rat!"</p>
<p>"I was afraid you would be frightened," said Sara.  "But you
needn't be.  I am making him tame.  He actually knows me and comes
out when I call him.  Are you too frightened to want to see him?"</p>

<p>The truth was that, as the days had gone on and, with the aid of
scraps brought up from the kitchen, her curious friendship had
developed, she had gradually forgotten that the timid creature she was
becoming familiar with was a mere rat.</p>
<p>At first Ermengarde was too much alarmed to do anything but
huddle in a heap upon the bed and tuck up her feet, but the sight of
Sara's composed little countenance and the story of Melchisedec's first
appearance began at last to rouse her curiosity, and she leaned forward
over the edge of the bed and watched Sara go and kneel down by the
hole in the skirting board.</p>
<p>"He&mdash;he won't run out quickly and jump on the bed, will he?" she
said.</p>
<p>"No," answered Sara.  "He's as polite as we are.  He is just like a
person.  Now watch!"</p>
<p>She began to make a low, whistling sound&mdash;so low and coaxing that
it could only have been heard in entire stillness.  She did it several
times, looking entirely absorbed in it.  Ermengarde thought she looked
as if she were working a spell.  And at last, evidently in response to it, a
gray-whiskered, bright-eyed head peeped out of the hole.  Sara had some


<pb n="113"/> crumbs in her hand.  She dropped them, and
Melchisedec came quietly forth and ate them.  A piece of larger size
than the rest he took and carried in the most businesslike manner back to
his home.</p>
<p>"You see," said Sara, "that is for his wife and children.  He is
very nice.  He only eats the little bits.  After he goes back I can always
hear his family squeaking for joy.  There are three kinds of squeaks.
One kind is the children's, and one is Mrs. Melchisedec's, and one is
Melchisedec's own."</p>
<p>Ermengarde began to laugh.</p>
<p>"Oh, Sara!" she said.  "You are queer&mdash;but you are nice."</p>
<p>"I know I am queer," admitted Sara, cheerfully; "and I try to be
nice."  She rubbed her forehead with her little brown paw, and a
puzzled, tender look came into her face.  "Papa always laughed at me,"
she said; "but I liked it.  He thought I was queer, but he liked me to
make up things.  I&mdash;I can't help making up things.  If I didn't, I don't
believe I could live."  She paused and glanced around the attic.  "I'm
sure I couldn't live here," she added in a low voice.</p>
<p>Ermengarde was interested, as she always was.  "When you talk
about things," she said, "they seem as if they grew real.  You talk about
Melchisedec as if he was a person."</p>
<p>"He is a person," said Sara.  "He gets hungry and frightened, just
as we do; and he is married and has children.  How do we know he
doesn't think things, just as we do?  His eyes look as if he was a person.
That was why I gave him a name."</p>
<p>She sat down on the floor in her favorite attitude, holding her
knees.</p>
<p>"Besides," she said, "he is a Bastille rat sent to be my friend.  I
can always get a bit of bread the cook has thrown away, and it is quite
enough to support him."</p>
<p>"Is it the Bastille yet?" asked Ermengarde, eagerly.  "Do you
always pretend it is the Bastille?"  </p>

<pb n="114"/>
<p>"Nearly always," answered Sara.  "Sometimes I try to pretend it is
another kind of place; but the Bastille is generally easiest&mdash;particularly
when it is cold."</p>
<p>Just at that moment Ermengarde almost jumped off the bed, she
was so startled by a sound she heard.  It was like two distinct knocks on
the wall.</p>
<p>"What is that?" she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Sara got up from the floor and answered quite dramatically:</p>

<p>"It is the prisoner in the next cell."</p>
<p>"Becky!" cried Ermengarde, enraptured.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Sara.  "Listen; the two knocks meant, 'Prisoner, are
you there?'"</p>
<p>She knocked three times on the wall herself, as if in answer.</p>

<p>"That means, 'Yes, I am here, and all is well.'"</p>
<p>Four knocks came from Becky's side of the wall.</p>
<p>"That means," explained Sara, "'Then, fellow-sufferer, we will
sleep in peace.  Good night.'"</p>
<p>Ermengarde quite beamed with delight.</p>
<p>"Oh, Sara!" she whispered joyfully.  "It is like a story!"</p>
<p>"It is a story," said Sara.  "Everything's a story.  You are a
story&mdash;I am a story.  Miss Minchin is a story."</p>
<p>And she sat down again and talked until Ermengarde forgot that
she was a sort of escaped prisoner herself, and had to be reminded by
Sara that she could not remain in the Bastille all night, but must steal
noiselessly downstairs again and creep back into her deserted bed.

<head>The Indian Gentleman</head>
<p>But it was a perilous thing for Ermengarde and Lottie to make
pilgrimages to the attic.  They could never be quite sure when Sara
would be there, and they could scarcely ever be certain that Miss Amelia
would not make a tour of inspection through the bedrooms after the
pupils were supposed to be asleep.  So their visits were rare ones, and
Sara lived a strange and lonely life.  It was a lonelier life when she was
downstairs than when she was in her attic.  She had no one to talk to;
and when she was sent out on errands and walked through the streets, a
forlorn little figure carrying a basket or a parcel, trying to hold her hat
on when the wind was blowing, and feeling the water soak through her
shoes when it was raining, she felt as if the crowds hurrying past her
made her loneliness greater.  When she had been the Princess

<pb n="116"/> Sara, driving through the streets in her brougham, or
walking, attended by Mariette, the sight of her bright, eager little face
and picturesque coats and hats had often caused people to look after her.
A happy, beautifully cared for little girl naturally attracts attention.
Shabby, poorly dressed children are not rare enough and pretty enough
to make people turn around to look at them and smile.  No one looked at
Sara in these days, and no one seemed to see her as she hurried along
the crowded pavements.  She had begun to grow very fast, and, as she
was dressed only in such clothes as the plainer remnants of her wardrobe
would supply, she knew she looked very queer, indeed.  All her valuable
garments had been disposed of, and such as had been left for her use she
was expected to wear so long as she could put them on at all.
Sometimes, when she passed a shop window with a mirror in it, she
almost laughed outright on catching a glimpse of herself, and sometimes
her face went red and she bit her lip and turned away.</p>
<p>In the evening, when she passed houses whose windows were
lighted up, she used to look into the warm rooms and amuse herself by
imagining things about the people she saw sitting before the fires or
about the tables.  It always interested her to catch glimpses of rooms
before the shutters were closed.  There were several families in the
square in which Miss Minchin lived, with which she had become quite
familiar in a way of her own.  The one she liked best she called the
Large Family.  She called it the Large Family not because the members
of it were big&mdash;for, indeed, most of them were little&mdash;but because there
were so many of them.  There were eight children in the Large Family,
and a stout, rosy mother, and a stout, rosy father, and a stout, rosy
grandmother, and any number of servants.  The eight children were
always either being taken out to walk or to ride in perambulators

<pb n="117"/> by comfortable nurses, or they were going to drive with
their mamma, or they were flying to the door in the evening to meet
their papa and kiss him and dance around him and drag off his overcoat
and look in the pockets for packages, or they were crowding about the
nursery windows and looking out and pushing each other and
laughing&mdash;in fact, they were always doing something enjoyable and suited
to the tastes of a large family.  Sara was quite fond of them, and had
given them names out of books&mdash;quite romantic names.  She called them
the Montmorencys when she did not call them the Large Family.  The
fat, fair baby with the lace cap was Ethelberta Beauchamp
Montmorency; the next baby was Violet Cholmondeley Montmorency;
the little boy who could just stagger and who had such round legs was
Sydney Cecil Vivian Montmorency; and then came Lilian Evangeline
Maud Marion, Rosalind Gladys, Guy Clarence, Veronica Eustacia, and
Claude Harold Hector.</p>
<p>One evening a very funny thing happened&mdash;though, perhaps, in one
sense it was not a funny thing at all.</p>
<p>Several of the Montmorencys were evidently going to a children's
party, and just as Sara was about to pass the door they were crossing the
pavement to get into the carriage which was waiting for them.  Veronica
Eustacia and Rosalind Gladys, in white-lace frocks and lovely sashes,
had just got in, and Guy Clarence, aged five, was following them.  He
was such a pretty fellow and had such rosy cheeks and blue eyes, and
such a darling little round head covered with curls, that Sara forgot her
basket and shabby cloak altogether&mdash;in fact, forgot everything but that
she wanted to look at him for a moment.  So she paused and
looked.</p>
<p>It was Christmas time, and the Large Family had been hearing
many stories about children who were poor and had

<pb n="118"/> no mammas and papas to fill their stockings and take
them to the pantomime&mdash;children who were, in fact, cold and thinly clad
and hungry.  In the stories, kind people&mdash;sometimes little boys and girls
with tender hearts&mdash;invariably saw the poor children and gave them
money or rich gifts, or took them home to beautiful dinners.  Guy
Clarence had been affected to tears that very afternoon by the reading of
such a story, and he had burned with a desire to find such a poor child
and give her a certain sixpence he possessed, and thus provide for her
for life.  An entire sixpence, he was sure, would mean affluence for
evermore.  As he crossed the strip of red carpet laid across the pavement
from the door to the carriage, he had this very sixpence in the pocket of
his very short man-o-war trousers; And just as Rosalind Gladys got into
the vehicle and jumped on the seat in order to feel the cushions spring
under her, he saw Sara standing on the wet pavement in her shabby
frock and hat, with her old basket on her arm, looking at him
hungrily.</p>
<p>He thought that her eyes looked hungry because she had perhaps
had nothing to eat for a long time.  He did not know that they looked so
because she was hungry for the warm, merry life his home held and his
rosy face spoke of, and that she had a hungry wish to snatch him in her
arms and kiss him.  He only knew that she had big eyes and a thin face
and thin legs and a common basket and poor clothes.  So he put his hand
in his pocket and found his sixpence and walked up to her
benignly.</p>
<p>"Here, poor little girl," he said.  "Here is a sixpence.  I will give
it to you."</p>
<p>Sara started, and all at once realized that she looked exactly like
poor children she had seen, in her better days, waiting on the pavement
to watch her as she got out of her brougham.  And she had given them
pennies many a time.</p>

<pb n="119"/>
<pb n="120"/> <p>Her face went red and then it went pale, and for a
second she felt as if she could not take the dear little sixpence.</p>
<p>"Oh, no!" she said.  "Oh, no, thank you; I mustn't take it, indeed!
"</p>
<p>Her voice was so unlike an ordinary street child's voice and her
manner was so like the manner of a well-bred little person that Veronica
Eustacia (whose real name was Janet) and Rosalind Gladys (who was
really called Nora) leaned forward to listen.</p>
<p>But Guy Clarence was not to be thwarted in his benevolence.  He
thrust the sixpence into her hand.</p>
<p>"Yes, you must take it, poor little girl!" he insisted stoutly.  "You
can buy things to eat with it.  It is a whole sixpence!"</p>
<p>There was something so honest and kind in his face, and he looked
so likely to be heartbrokenly disappointed if she did not take it, that Sara
knew she must not refuse him.  To be as proud as that would be a cruel
thing.  So she actually put her pride in her pocket, though it must be
admitted her cheeks burned.</p>
<p>"Thank you," she said.  "You are a kind, kind little darling thing."
And as he scrambled joyfully into the carriage she went away, trying to
smile, though she caught her breath quickly and her eyes were shining
through a mist.  She had known that she looked odd and shabby, but
until now she had not known that she might be taken for a beggar.</p>

<p>As the Large Family's carriage drove away, the children inside it
were talking with interested excitement.</p>
<p>"Oh, Donald," (this was Guy Clarence's name), Janet exclaimed
alarmedly, "why did you offer that little girl your sixpence?  I'm sure
she is not a beggar!"</p>
<p>"She didn't speak like a beggar!" cried Nora.  "And her face
didn't really look like a beggar's face!"  </p>

<pb n="121"/>
<p>"Besides, she didn't beg," said Janet.  "I was so afraid she might
be angry with you.  You know, it makes people angry to be taken for
beggars when they are not beggars."</p>
<p>"She wasn't angry," said Donald, a trifle dismayed, but still firm.
"She laughed a little, and she said I was a kind, kind little darling thing.
And I was!"&mdash;stoutly.  "It was my whole sixpence."</p>
<p>Janet and Nora exchanged glances.</p>
<p>"A beggar girl would never have said that," decided Janet.  "She
would have said, 'Thank yer kindly, little gentleman&mdash;thank yer, sir;' and
perhaps she would have bobbed a curtsy."</p>
<p>Sara knew nothing about the fact, but from that time the Large
Family was as profoundly interested in her as she was in it.  Faces used
to appear at the nursery windows when she passed, and many discussions
concerning her were held round the fire.</p>
<p>"She is a kind of servant at the seminary," Janet said.  "I don't
believe she belongs to anybody.  I believe she is an orphan.  But she is
not a beggar, however shabby she looks."</p>
<p>And afterward she was called by all of them,
"The-little-girl-who-is-not-a-beggar," which was, of course, rather a long
name, and sounded very funny sometimes when the youngest ones said it
in a hurry.</p>
<p>Sara managed to bore a hole in the sixpence and hung it on an old
bit of narrow ribbon round her neck.  Her affection for the Large Family
increased&mdash;as, indeed, her affection for everything she could love
increased.  She grew fonder and fonder of Becky, and she used to look
forward to the two mornings a week when she went into the schoolroom
to give the little ones their French lesson.  Her small pupils loved her,
and strove with each other for the privilege of standing close to her and
insinuating their small hands

<pb n="122"/> into hers.  It fed her hungry heart to feel them nestling
up to her.  She made such friends with the sparrows that when she stood
upon the table, put her head and shoulders out of the attic window, and
chirped, she heard almost immediately a flutter of wings and answering
twitters, and a little flock of dingy town birds appeared and alighted on
the slates to talk to her and make much of the crumbs she scattered.
With Melchisedec she had become so intimate that he actually brought
Mrs. Melchisedec with him sometimes, and now and then one or two of
his children.  She used to talk to him, and, somehow, he looked quite as
if he understood.</p>
<p>There had grown in her mind rather a strange feeling about Emily,
who always sat and looked on at everything.  It arose in one of her
moments of great desolateness.  She would have liked to believe or
pretend to believe that Emily understood and sympathized with her.  She
did not like to own to herself that her only companion could feel and
hear nothing.  She used to put her in a chair sometimes and sit opposite
to her on the old red footstool, and stare and pretend about her until her
own eyes would grow large with something which was almost like
fear&mdash;particularly at night when everything was so still, when the only
sound in the attic was the occasional sudden scurry and squeak of
Melchisedec's family in the wall.  One of her "pretends" was that Emily
was a kind of good witch who could protect her.  Sometimes, after she
had stared at her until she was wrought up to the highest pitch of
fancifulness, she would ask her questions and find herself almost feeling
as if she would presently answer.  But she never did.</p>
<p>"As to answering, though," said Sara, trying to console herself, "I
don't answer very often.  I never answer when I can help it.  When
people are insulting you, there is nothing so good for them as not to say
a word&mdash;just to look at them

<pb n="123"/> and think.  Miss Minchin turns pale with rage when I
do it, Miss Amelia looks frightened, and so do the girls.  When you will
not fly into a passion people know you are stronger than they are,
because you are strong enough to hold in your rage, and they are not,
and they say stupid things they wish they hadn't said afterward.  There's
nothing so strong as rage, except what makes you hold it in&mdash;that's
stronger.  It's a good thing not to answer your enemies.  I scarcely ever
do.  Perhaps Emily is more like me than I am like myself.  Perhaps she
would rather not answer her friends, even.  She keeps it all in her
heart."</p>
<p>But though she tried to satisfy herself with these arguments, she
did not find it easy.  When, after a long, hard day, in which she had
been sent here and there, sometimes on long errands through wind and
cold and rain, she came in wet and hungry, and was sent out again
because nobody chose to remember that she was only a child, and that
her slim legs might be tired and her small body might be chilled; when
she had been given only harsh words and cold, slighting looks for
thanks; when the cook had been vulgar and insolent; when Miss Minchin
had been in her worst mood, and when she had seen the girls sneering
among themselves at her shabbiness&mdash;then she was not always able to
comfort her sore, proud, desolate heart with fancies when Emily merely
sat upright in her old chair and stared.</p>
<p>One of these nights, when she came up to the attic cold and
hungry, with a tempest raging in her young breast, Emily's stare seemed
so vacant, her sawdust legs and arms so inexpressive, that Sara lost all
control over herself.  There was nobody but Emily&mdash;no one in the world.
And there she sat.</p>
<p>"I shall die presently," she said at first.</p>
<p>Emily simply stared.</p>

<pb n="124"/>
<p>"I can't bear this," said the poor child, trembling.  "I know I shall
die.  I'm cold; I'm wet; I'm starving to death. I've walked a thousand
miles today, and they have done nothing but scold me from morning
until night.  And because I could not find that last thing the cook sent me
for, they would not give me any supper.  Some men laughed at me
because my old shoes made me slip down in the mud.  I'm covered with
mud now.  And they laughed.  Do you hear?"</p>
<p>She looked at the staring glass eyes and complacent face, and
suddenly a sort of heartbroken rage seized her.  She lifted her little
savage hand and knocked Emily off the chair, bursting into a passion of
sobbing&mdash;Sara who never cried.</p>
<p>"You are nothing but a doll!" she cried.  "Nothing but a
doll&mdash;doll&mdash;doll! You care for nothing.  You are stuffed with sawdust.
You never had a heart.  Nothing could ever make you feel.  You are a
doll!"</p>
<p>Emily lay on the floor, with her legs ignominiously doubled up
over her head, and a new flat place on the end of her nose; but she was
calm, even dignified.  Sara hid her face in her arms.  The rats in the
wall began to fight and bite each other and squeak and scramble.
Melchisedec was chastising some of his family.</p>
<p>Sara's sobs gradually quieted themselves.  It was so unlike her to
break down that she was surprised at herself.  After a while she raised
her face and looked at Emily, who seemed to be gazing at her round the
side of one angle, and, somehow, by this time actually with a kind of
glassy-eyed sympathy.  Sara bent and picked her up.  Remorse overtook
her.  She even smiled at herself a very little smile.</p>
<p>"You can't help being a doll," she said with a resigned sigh, "any
more than Lavinia and Jessie can help not having any sense.  We are not
all made alike.  Perhaps you do your sawdust best."  And she kissed her
and shook her clothes straight, and put her back upon her chair.  </p>


<pb n="125"/>
<p>She had wished very much that some one would take the empty
house next door.  She wished it because of the attic window which was
so near hers.  It seemed as if it would be so nice to see it propped open
someday and a head and shoulders rising out of the square
aperture.</p>
<p>"If it looked a nice head," she thought, "I might begin by saying,
'Good morning,' and all sorts of things might happen.  But, of course,
it's not really likely that anyone but under servants would sleep
there."</p>
<p>One morning, on turning the corner of the square after a visit to
the grocer's, the butcher's, and the baker's, she saw, to her great
delight, that during her rather prolonged absence, a van full of furniture
had stopped before the next house, the front doors were thrown open,
and men in shirt sleeves were going in and out carrying heavy packages
and pieces of furniture.</p>
<p>"It's taken!" she said.  "It really is taken!  Oh, I do hope a nice
head will look out of the attic window!"</p>
<p>She would almost have liked to join the group of loiterers who had
stopped on the pavement to watch the things carried in.  She had an idea
that if she could see some of the furniture she could guess something
about the people it belonged to.</p>
<p>"Miss Minchin's tables and chairs are just like her," she thought;
"I remember thinking that the first minute I saw her, even though I was
so little.  I told papa afterward, and he laughed and said it was true.  I
am sure the Large Family have fat, comfortable armchairs and sofas, and
I can see that their red-flowery wallpaper is exactly like them.  It's warm
and cheerful and kind-looking and happy."</p>
<p>She was sent out for parsley to the greengrocer's later in the day,
and when she came up the area steps her heart gave quite a quick beat of
recognition.  Several pieces of furniture had been set out of the van upon
the pavement.

<pb n="126"/> There was a beautiful table of elaborately wrought
teakwood, and some chairs, and a screen covered with rich Oriental
embroidery.  The sight of them gave her a weird, homesick feeling.  She
had seen things so like them in India.  One of the things Miss Minchin
had taken from her was a carved teakwood desk her father had sent
her.</p>
<p>"They are beautiful things," she said; "they look as if they ought
to belong to a nice person.  All the things look rather grand.  I suppose
it is a rich family."</p>
<p>The vans of furniture came and were unloaded and gave place to
others all the day.  Several times it so happened that Sara had an
opportunity of seeing things carried in.  It became plain that she had
been right in guessing that the newcomers were people of large means.
All the furniture was rich and beautiful, and a great deal of it was
Oriental.  Wonderful rugs and draperies and ornaments were taken from
the vans, many pictures, and books enough for a library.  Among other
things there was a superb god Buddha in a splendid shrine.</p>
<p>"Someone in the family must have been in India," Sara thought.
"They have got used to Indian things and like them.  I am glad.  I shall
feel as if they were friends, even if a head never looks out of the attic
window."</p>
<p>When she was taking in the evening's milk for the cook (there was
really no odd job she was not called upon to do), she saw something
occur which made the situation more interesting than ever.  The
handsome, rosy man who was the father of the Large Family walked
across the square in the most matter-of-fact manner, and ran up the steps
of the next-door house.  He ran up them as if he felt quite at home and
expected to run up and down them many a time in the future.  He stayed
inside quite a long time, and several times came out and gave directions
to the workmen, as if he had a right to do so.  It was quite certain that
he was in some intimate way connected with the newcomers and was
acting for them.  </p>

<pb n="127"/>
<p>"If the new people have children," Sara speculated, "the Large
Family children will be sure to come and play with them, and they might
come up into the attic just for fun."</p>
<p>At night, after her work was done, Becky came in to see her
fellow prisoner and bring her news.</p>
<p>"It's a' Nindian gentleman that's comin' to live next door, miss,"
she said.  "I don't know whether he's a black gentleman or not, but he's
a Nindian one.  He's very rich, an' he's ill, an' the gentleman of the
Large Family is his lawyer.  He's had a lot of trouble, an' it's made him
ill an' low in his mind.  He worships idols, miss.  He's an 'eathen an'
bows down to wood an' stone.  I seen a' idol bein' carried in for him to
worship.  Somebody had oughter send him a trac'.  You can get a trac'
for a penny."</p>
<p>Sara laughed a little.</p>
<p>"I don't believe he worships that idol," she said; "some people like
to keep them to look at because they are interesting.  My papa had a
beautiful one, and he did not worship it."</p>
<p>But Becky was rather inclined to prefer to believe that the new
neighbor was "an 'eathen."  It sounded so much more romantic than that
he should merely be the ordinary kind of gentleman who went to church
with a prayer book.  She sat and talked long that night of what he would
be like, of what his wife would be like if he had one, and of what his
children would be like if they had children.  Sara saw that privately she
could not help hoping very much that they would all be black, and would
wear turbans, and, above all, that&mdash;like their parent&mdash;they would all be
"'eathens."</p>
<p>"I never lived next door to no 'eathens, miss," she said; "I should
like to see what sort o' ways they'd have."</p>
<p>It was several weeks before her curiosity was satisfied, and then it
was revealed that the new occupant had neither wife nor children.  He
was a solitary man with no family at

<pb n="128"/> all, and it was evident that he was shattered in health
and unhappy in mind.</p>
<p>A carriage drove up one day and stopped before the house.  When
the footman dismounted from the box and opened the door the gentleman
who was the father of the Large Family got out first.  After him there
descended a nurse in uniform, then came down the steps two
men-servants.  They came to assist their master, who, when he was
helped out of the carriage, proved to be a man with a haggard, distressed
face, and a skeleton body wrapped in furs.  He was carried up the steps,
and the head of the Large Family went with him, looking very anxious.
Shortly afterward a doctor's carriage arrived, and the doctor went
in&mdash;plainly to take care of him.</p>
<p>"There is such a yellow gentleman next door, Sara," Lottie
whispered at the French class afterward.  "Do you think he is a Chinee?
The geography says the Chinee men are yellow."</p>
<p>"No, he is not Chinese," Sara whispered back; "he is very ill.  Go
on with your exercise, Lottie.  'Non, monsieur.  Je n'ai pas le canif de
mon oncle.'"</p>
<p>That was the beginning of the story of the Indian gentleman.

<head>Ram Dass</head>
<p>There were fine sunsets even in the square, sometimes.  One could
only see parts of them, however, between the chimneys and over the
roofs.  From the kitchen windows one could not see them at all, and
could only guess that they were going on because the bricks looked
warm and the air rosy or yellow for a while, or perhaps one saw a
blazing glow strike a particular pane of glass somewhere.  There was,
however, one place from which one could see all the splendor of them:
the piles of red or gold clouds in the west; or the purple ones edged with
dazzling brightness; or the little fleecy, floating ones, tinged with
rose-color and looking like flights of pink doves scurrying across the
blue in a great hurry if there was a wind.  The place where one could
see all this, and seem at the same time to breathe a purer air, was, of
course, the attic window.  When the square suddenly seemed

<pb n="130"/> to begin to glow in an enchanted way and look
wonderful in spite of its sooty trees and railings, Sara knew something
was going on in the sky; and when it was at all possible to leave the
kitchen without being missed or called back, she invariably stole away
and crept up the flights of stairs, and, climbing on the old table, got her
head and body as far out of the window as possible.  When she had
accomplished this, she always drew a long breath and looked all round
her.  It used to seem as if she had all the sky and the world to herself.
No one else ever looked out of the other attics.  Generally the skylights
were closed; but even if they were propped open to admit air, no one
seemed to come near them.  And there Sara would stand, sometimes
turning her face upward to the blue which seemed so friendly and
near&mdash;just like a lovely vaulted ceiling&mdash;sometimes watching the west and
all the wonderful things that happened there: the clouds melting or
drifting or waiting softly to be changed pink or crimson or snow-white
or purple or pale dove-gray.  Sometimes they made islands or great
mountains enclosing lakes of deep turquoise-blue, or liquid amber, or
chrysoprase-green; sometimes dark headlands jutted into strange, lost
seas; sometimes slender strips of wonderful lands joined other wonderful
lands together.  There were places where it seemed that one could run or
climb or stand and wait to see what next was coming&mdash;until, perhaps, as
it all melted, one could float away.  At least it seemed so to Sara, and
nothing had ever been quite so beautiful to her as the things she saw as
she stood on the table&mdash;her body half out of the skylight&mdash;the sparrows
twittering with sunset softness on the slates.  The sparrows always
seemed to her to twitter with a sort of subdued softness just when these
marvels were going on.</p>
<p>There was such a sunset as this a few days after the Indian
gentleman was brought to his new home; and, as it fortunately happened
that the afternoon's work was done in

<pb n="131"/> the kitchen and nobody had ordered her to go anywhere
or perform any task, Sara found it easier than usual to slip away and go
upstairs.</p>
<p>She mounted her table and stood looking out. lt was a wonderful
moment.  There were floods of molten gold covering the west, as if a
glorious tide was sweeping over the world.  A deep, rich yellow light
filled the air; the birds flying across the tops of the houses showed quite
black against it.</p>
<p>"It's a Splendid one," said Sara, softly, to herself.  "It makes me
feel almost afraid&mdash;as if something strange was just going to happen.
The Splendid ones always make me feel like that."</p>
<p>She suddenly turned her head because she heard a sound a few
yards away from her.  It was an odd sound like a queer little squeaky
chattering.  It came from the window of the next attic.  Someone had
come to look at the sunset as she had.  There was a head and a part of a
body emerging from the skylight, but it was not the head or body of a
little girl or a housemaid; it was the picturesque white-swathed form and
dark-faced, gleaming-eyed, white-turbaned head of a native Indian
man-servant&mdash;"a Lascar," Sara said to herself quickly&mdash;and the sound she
had heard came from a small monkey he held in his arms as if he were
fond of it, and which was snuggling and chattering against his
breast.</p>
<p>As Sara looked toward him he looked toward her.  The first thing
she thought was that his dark face looked sorrowful and homesick.  She
felt absolutely sure he had come up to look at the sun, because he had
seen it so seldom in England that he longed for a sight of it.  She looked
at him interestedly for a second, and then smiled across the slates.  She
had learned to know how comforting a smile, even from a stranger, may
be.</p>
<p>Hers was evidently a pleasure to him.  His whole expression
altered, and he showed such gleaming white teeth as he

<pb n="132"/> smiled back that it was as if a light had been
illuminated in his dusky face.  The friendly look in Sara's eyes was
always very effective when people felt tired or dull.</p>
<p>It was perhaps in making his salute to her that he loosened his hold
on the monkey.  He was an impish monkey and always ready for
adventure, and it is probable that the sight of a little girl excited him.
He suddenly broke loose, jumped on to the slates, ran across them
chattering, and actually leaped on to Sara's shoulder, and from there
down into her attic room.  It made her laugh and delighted her; but she
knew he must be restored to his master&mdash;if the Lascar was his
master&mdash;and she wondered how this was to be done.  Would he let her
catch him, or would he be naughty and refuse to be caught, and perhaps
get away and run off over the roofs and be lost?  That would not do at
all.  Perhaps he belonged to the Indian gentleman, and the poor man was
fond of him.</p>
<p>She turned to the Lascar, feeling glad that she remembered still
some of the Hindustani she had learned when she lived with her father.
She could make the man understand.  She spoke to him in the language
he knew.</p>
<p>"Will he let me catch him?" she asked.</p>
<p>She thought she had never seen more surprise and delight than the
dark face expressed when she spoke in the familiar tongue.  The truth
was that the poor fellow felt as if his gods had intervened, and the kind
little voice came from heaven itself.  At once Sara saw that he had been
accustomed to European children.  He poured forth a flood of respectful
thanks.  He was the servant of Missee Sahib.  The monkey was a good
monkey and would not bite; but, unfortunately, he was difficult to catch.
He would flee from one spot to another, like the lightning.  He was
disobedient, though not evil.  Ram Dass knew him as if he were his
child,

<pb n="133"/> and Ram Dass he would sometimes obey, but not
always.  If Missee Sahib would permit Ram Dass, he himself could cross
the roof to her room, enter the windows, and regain the unworthy little
animal.  But he was evidently afraid Sara might think he was taking a
great liberty and perhaps would not let him come.</p>
<p>But Sara gave him leave at once.</p>
<p>"Can you get across?" she inquired.</p>
<p>"In a moment," he answered her.</p>
<p>"Then come," she said; "he is flying from side to side of the room
as if he was frightened."</p>
<p>Ram Dass slipped through his attic window and crossed to hers as
steadily and lightly as if he had walked on roofs all his life.  He slipped
through the skylight and dropped upon his feet without a sound.  Then
he turned to Sara and salaamed again.  The monkey saw him and uttered
a little scream.  Ram Dass hastily took the precaution of shutting the
skylight, and then went in chase of him.  It was not a very long chase.
The monkey prolonged it a few minutes evidently for the mere fun of it,
but presently he sprang chattering on to Ram Dass's shoulder and sat
there chattering and clinging to his neck with a weird little skinny
arm.</p>
<p>Ram Dass thanked Sara profoundly.  She had seen that his quick
native eyes had taken in at a glance all the bare shabbiness of the room,
but he spoke to her as if he were speaking to the little daughter of a
rajah, and pretended that he observed nothing.  He did not presume to
remain more than a few moments after he had caught the monkey, and
those moments were given to further deep and grateful obeisance to her
in return for her indulgence.  This little evil one, he said, stroking the
monkey, was, in truth, not so evil as he seemed, and his master, who
was ill, was sometimes amused by him.  He would have been made sad
if his favorite

<pb n="134"/> had run away and been lost.  Then he salaamed once
more and got through the skylight and across the slates again with as
much agility as the monkey himself had displayed.</p>
<p>When he had gone Sara stood in the middle of her attic and
thought of many things his face and his manner had brought back to her.
The sight of his native costume and the profound reverence of his
manner stirred all her past memories.  It seemed a strange thing to
remember that she&mdash;the drudge whom the cook had said insulting things
to an hour ago&mdash;had only a few years ago been surrounded by people
who all treated her as Ram Dass had treated her; who salaamed when
she went by, whose foreheads almost touched the ground when she spoke
to them, who were her servants and her slaves.  It was like a sort of
dream.  It was all over, and it could never come back.  It certainly
seemed that there was no way in which any change could take place.
She knew what Miss Minchin intended that her future should be.  So
long as she was too young to be used as a regular teacher, she would be
used as an errand girl and servant and yet expected to remember what
she had learned and in some mysterious way to learn more.  The greater
number of her evenings she was supposed to spend at study, and at
various indefinite intervals she was examined and knew she would have
been severely admonished if she had not advanced as was expected of
her.  The truth, indeed, was that Miss Minchin knew that she was too
anxious to learn to require teachers.  Give her books, and she would
devour them and end by knowing them by heart.  She might be trusted to
be equal to teaching a good deal in the course of a few years.  This was
what would happen: when she was older she would be expected to
drudge in the schoolroom as she drudged now in various parts of the
house; they would be obliged to give her more respectable clothes, but
they would be sure to

<pb n="135"/>
<pb n="136"/> be plain and ugly and to make her look somehow like a
servant.  That was all there seemed to be to look forward to, and Sara
stood quite still for several minutes and thought it over.</p>
<p>Then a thought came back to her which made the color rise in her
cheek and a spark light itself in her eyes.  She straightened her thin little
body and lifted her head.</p>
<p>"Whatever comes," she said, "cannot alter one thing.  If I am a
princess in rags and tatters, I can be a princess inside. It would be easy
to be a princess if I were dressed in cloth of gold, but it is a great deal
more of a triumph to be one all the time when no one knows it.  There
was Marie Antoinette when she was in prison and her throne was gone
and she had only a black gown on, and her hair was white, and they
insulted her and called her Widow Capet.  She was a great deal more
like a queen then than when she was so gay and everything was so
grand.  I like her best then.  Those howling mobs of people did not
frighten her.  She was stronger than they were, even when they cut her
head off."</p>
<p>This was not a new thought, but quite an old one, by this time.  It
had consoled her through many a bitter day, and she had gone about the
house with an expression in her face which Miss Minchin could not
understand and which was a source of great annoyance to her, as it
seemed as if the child were mentally living a life which held her above
he rest of the world.  It was as if she scarcely heard the rude and acid
things said to her; or, if she heard them, did not care for them at all.
Sometimes, when she was in the midst of some harsh, domineering
speech, Miss Minchin would find the still, unchildish eyes fixed upon
her with something like a proud smile in them.  At such times she did
not know that Sara was saying to herself:</p>
<p>"You don't know that you are saying these things to a

<pb n="137"/> princess, and that if I chose I could wave my hand and
order you to execution.  I only spare you because I am a princess, and
you are a poor, stupid, unkind, vulgar old thing, and don't know any
better."</p>
<p>This used to interest and amuse her more than anything else; and
queer and fanciful as it was, she found comfort in it and it was a good
thing for her.  While the thought held possession of her, she could not
be made rude and malicious by the rudeness and malice of those about
her.</p>
<p>"A princess must be polite," she said to herself.</p>
<p>And so when the servants, taking their tone from their mistress,
were insolent and ordered her about, she would hold her head erect and
reply to them with a quaint civility which often made them stare at
her.</p>
<p>"She's got more airs and graces than if she come from
Buckingham Palace, that young one," said the cook, chuckling a little
sometimes.  "I lose my temper with her often enough, but I will say she
never forgets her manners.  'If you please, cook'; 'Will you be so kind,
cook?' 'I beg your pardon, cook'; 'May I trouble you, cook?'  She drops
'em about the kitchen as if they was nothing."</p>
<p>The morning after the interview with Ram Dass and his monkey,
Sara was in the schoolroom with her small pupils.  Having finished
giving them their lessons, she was putting the French exercise-books
together and thinking, as she did it, of the various things royal
personages in disguise were called upon to do: Alfred the Great, for
instance, burning the cakes and getting his ears boxed by the wife of the
neat-herd.  How frightened she must have been when she found out what
she had done.  If Miss Minchin should find out that she&mdash;Sara, whose
toes were almost sticking out of her boots&mdash;was a princess&mdash;a real one!
The look in her eyes was exactly the look which Miss Minchin most
disliked.  She would not

<pb n="138"/> have it; she was quite near her and was so enraged that
she actually flew at her and boxed her ears&mdash;exactly as the neat-herd's
wife had boxed King Alfred's.  It made Sara start.  She wakened from
her dream at the shock, and, catching her breath, stood still a second.
Then, not knowing she was going to do it, she broke into a little
laugh.</p>
<p>"What are you laughing at, you bold, impudent child?" Miss
Minchin exclaimed.</p>
<p>It took Sara a few seconds to control herself sufficiently to
remember that she was a princess.  Her cheeks were red and smarting
from the blows she had received.</p>
<p>"I was thinking," she answered.</p>
<p>"Beg my pardon immediately," said Miss Minchin.</p>
<p>Sara hesitated a second before she replied.</p>
<p>"I will beg your pardon for laughing, if it was rude," she said
then; "but I won't beg your pardon for thinking."</p>
<p>"What were you thinking?" demanded Miss Minchin. </p>
<p>"How dare you think?  What were you thinking?"</p>
<p>Jessie tittered, and she and Lavinia nudged each other in unison.
All the girls looked up from their books to listen.  Really, it always
interested them a little when Miss Minchin attacked Sara.  Sara always
said something queer, and never seemed the least bit frightened.  She
was not in the least frightened now, though her boxed ears were scarlet
and her eyes were as bright as stars.</p>
<p>"I was thinking," she answered grandly and politely, "that you did
not know what you were doing."</p>
<p>"That I did not know what I was doing?" Miss Minchin fairly
gasped.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Sara, "and I was thinking what would happen if I were
a princess and you boxed my ears&mdash;what I should do to you.  And I was
thinking that if I were one, you would never dare to do it, whatever I
said or did.  And

<pb n="139"/> I was thinking how surprised and frightened you would
be if you suddenly found out&mdash;"</p>
<p>She had the imagined future so clearly before her eyes that she
spoke in a manner which had an effect even upon Miss Minchin.  It
almost seemed for the moment to her narrow, unimaginative mind that
there must be some real power hidden behind this candid daring.</p>
<p>"What?" she exclaimed.  "Found out what?"</p>
<p>"That I really was a princess," said Sara, "and could do
anything&mdash;anything I liked."</p>
<p>Every pair of eyes in the room widened to its full limit.  Lavinia
leaned forward on her seat to look.</p>
<p>"Go to your room," cried Miss Minchin, breathlessly, "this
instant!  Leave the schoolroom!  Attend to your lessons, young
ladies!"</p>
<p>Sara made a little bow.</p>
<p>"Excuse me for laughing if it was impolite," she said, and walked
out of the room, leaving Miss Minchin struggling with her rage, and the
girls whispering over their books.</p>
<p>"Did you see her?  Did you see how queer she looked?" Jessie
broke out.  "I shouldn't be at all surprised if she did turn out to be
something.  Suppose she should!"  </p>

<head>The Other Side of the Wall</head>
<p>When one lives in a row of houses, it is interesting to think of the
things which are being done and said on the other side of the wall of the
very rooms one is living in.  Sara was fond of amusing herself by trying
to imagine the things hidden by the wall which divided the Select
Seminary from the Indian gentleman's house.  She knew that the
schoolroom was next to the Indian gentleman's study, and she hoped that
the wall was thick so that the noise made sometimes after lesson hours
would not disturb him.</p>
<p>"I am growing quite fond of him," she said to Ermengarde; "I
should not like him to be disturbed.  I have adopted him for a friend.
You can do that with people you never speak to at all.  You can just
watch them, and think about them and be sorry for them, until they seem
almost like relations.  I'm quite anxious sometimes when I see the doctor
call twice a day."</p>
<p>"I have very few relations," said Ermengarde, reflectively,

<pb n="141"/> "and I'm very glad of it.  I don't like those I have.  My
two aunts are always saying, 'Dear me, Ermengarde! You are very fat.
You shouldn't eat sweets,' and my uncle is always asking me things like,
'When did Edward the Third ascend the throne?' and, 'Who died of a
surfeit of lampreys?'"</p>
<p>Sara laughed.</p>
<p>"People you never speak to can't ask you questions like that," she
said; "and I'm sure the Indian gentleman wouldn't even if he was quite
intimate with you.  I am fond of him."</p>
<p>She had become fond of the Large Family because they looked
happy; but she had become fond of the Indian gentleman because he
looked unhappy.  He had evidently not fully recovered from some very
severe illness.  In the kitchen&mdash;where, of course, the servants, through
some mysterious means, knew everything&mdash;there was much discussion of
his case.  He was not an Indian gentleman really, but an Englishman
who had lived in India.  He had met with great misfortunes which had
for a time so imperilled his whole fortune that he had thought himself
ruined and disgraced forever.  The shock had been so great that he had
almost died of brain fever; and ever since he had been shattered in
health, though his fortunes had changed and all his possessions had been
restored to him.  His trouble and peril had been connected with
mines.</p>
<p>"And mines with diamonds in 'em!" said the cook.  "No savin's of
mine never goes into no mines&mdash;particular diamond ones"&mdash;with a side
glance at Sara.  "We all know somethin' of them."</p>
<p>"He felt as my papa felt," Sara thought.  "He was ill as my papa
was; but he did not die."</p>
<p>So her heart was more drawn to him than before.  When she was
sent out at night she used sometimes to feel quite

<pb n="142"/> glad, because there was always a chance that the
curtains of the house next door might not yet be closed and she could
look into the warm room and see her adopted friend.  When no one was
about she used sometimes to stop, and, holding to the iron railings, wish
him good night as if he could hear her.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you can feel if you can't hear," was her fancy.  "Perhaps
kind thoughts reach people somehow, even through windows and doors
and walls.  Perhaps you feel a little warm and comforted, and don't
know why, when I am standing here in the cold and hoping you will get
well and happy again.  I am so sorry for you," she would whisper in an
intense little voice.  "I wish you had a 'Little Missus' who could pet you
as I used to pet papa when he had a headache.  I should like to be your
'Little Missus' myself, poor dear!  Good night&mdash;good night.  God bless
you!"</p>
<p>She would go away, feeling quite comforted and a little warmer
herself.  Her sympathy was so strong that it seemed as if it must reach
him somehow as he sat alone in his armchair by the fire, nearly always
in a great dressing gown, and nearly always with his forehead resting in
his hand as he gazed hopelessly into the fire.  He looked to Sara like a
man who had a trouble on his mind still, not merely like one whose
troubles lay all in the past.</p>
<p>"He always seems as if he were thinking of something that hurts
him now," she said to herself, "but he has got his money back and he
will get over his brain fever in time, so he ought not to look like that.  I
wonder if there is something else."</p>
<p>If there was something else&mdash;something even servants did not hear
of&mdash;she could not help believing that the father of the Large Family knew
it&mdash;the gentleman she called Mr. Montmorency.  Mr. Montmorency went
to see him often, and Mrs. Montmorency and all the little Montmorencys
went,

<pb n="143"/> too, though less often.  He seemed particularly fond of
the two elder little girls&mdash;the Janet and Nora who had been so alarmed
when their small brother Donald had given Sara his sixpence.  He had,
in fact, a very tender place in his heart for all children, and particularly
for little girls.  Janet and Nora were as fond of him as he was of them,
and looked forward with the greatest pleasure to the afternoons when
they were allowed to cross the square and make their well-behaved little
visits to him.  They were extremely decorous little visits because he was
an invalid.</p>
<p>"He is a poor thing," said Janet, "and he says we cheer him up.
We try to cheer him up very quietly."</p>
<p>Janet was the head of the family, and kept the rest of it in order.
It was she who decided when it was discreet to ask the Indian gentleman
to tell stories about India, and it was she who saw when  was tired and it
was the time to steal quietly away and tell Ram Dass to go to him.  They
were very fond of Ram Dass.  He could have told any number of stories
if he had been able to speak anything but Hindustani.  The Indian
gentleman's real name was Mr. Carrisford, and Janet told Mr.
Carrisford about the encounter with the little-girl-who-was-not-a-beggar.
He was very much interested, and all the more so when he heard from
Ram Dass of the adventure of the monkey on the roof.  Ram Dass made
for him a very clear picture of the attic and its desolateness&mdash;of the bare
floor and broken plaster, the rusty, empty grate, and the hard, narrow
bed.</p>
<p>"Carmichael," he said to the father of the Large Family, after he
had heard this description, "I wonder how many of the attics in this
square are like that one, and how many wretched little servant girls sleep
on such beds, while I toss on my down pillows, loaded and harassed by
wealth that is, most of it&mdash;not mine."</p>

<pb n="144"/>
<p>"My dear fellow," Mr. Carmichael answered cheerily, "the sooner
you cease tormenting yourself the better it will be for you.  If you
possessed all the wealth of all the Indies, you could not set right all the
discomforts in the world, and if you began to refurnish all the attics in
this square, there would still remain all the attics in all the other squares
and streets to put in order.  And there you are!"</p>
<p>Mr. Carrisford sat and bit his nails as he looked into the glowing
bed of coals in the grate.</p>
<p>"Do you suppose," he said slowly, after a pause&mdash;"do you think it
is possible that the other child&mdash;the child I never cease thinking of, I
believe&mdash;could be&mdash;could possibly be reduced to any such condition as the
poor little soul next door?"</p>
<p>Mr. Carmichael looked at him uneasily.  He knew that the worst
thing the man could do for himself, for his reason and his health, was to
begin to think in the particular way of this particular subject.</p>
<p>"If the child at Madame Pascal's school in Paris was the one you
are in search of," he answered soothingly, "she would seem to be in the
hands of people who can afford to take care of her.  They adopted her
because she had been the favorite companion of their little daughter who
died.  They had no other children, and Madame Pascal said that they
were extremely well-to-do Russians."</p>
<p>"And the wretched woman actually did not know where they had
taken her!" exclaimed Mr. Carrisford.</p>
<p>Mr. Carmichael shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"She was a shrewd, worldly Frenchwoman, and was evidently only
too glad to get the child so comfortably off her hands when the father's
death left her totally unprovided for.  Women of her type do not trouble
themselves about the futures of children who might prove burdens.  The
adopted parents apparently disappeared and left no trace."  </p>

<pb n="145"/>
<p>"But you say 'if' the child was the one I am in search of.  You say
'if.'  We are not sure.  There was a difference in the name."</p>
<p>"Madame Pascal pronounced it as if it were Carew instead of
Crewe&mdash;but that might be merely a matter of pronunciation.  The
circumstances were curiously similar.  An English officer in India had
placed his motherless little girl at the school.  He had died suddenly after
losing his fortune." Mr. Carmichael paused a moment, as if a new
thought had occurred to him.  "Are you sure the child was left at a
school in Paris?  Are you sure it was Paris?"</p>
<p>"My dear fellow," broke forth Carrisford, with restless bitterness,
"I am sure of nothing.  I never saw either the child or her mother.
Ralph Crewe and I loved each other as boys, but we had not met since
our school days, until we met in India.  I was absorbed in the
magnificent promise of the mines.  He became absorbed, too.  The
whole thing was so huge and glittering that we half lost our heads.
When we met we scarcely spoke of anything else.  I only knew that the
child had been sent to school somewhere.  I do not even remember,
now, how I knew it."</p>
<p>He was beginning to be excited.  He always became excited when
his still weakened brain was stirred by memories of the catastrophes of
the past.</p>
<p>Mr. Carmichael watched him anxiously.  It was necessary to ask
some questions, but they must be put quietly and with caution.</p>
<p>"But you had reason to think the school was in Paris?"</p>
<p>"Yes," was the answer, "because her mother was a Frenchwoman,
and I had heard that she wished her child to be educated in Paris.  It
seemed only likely that she would be there."</p>
<p>"Yes," Mr. Carmichael said, "it seems more than probable."
</p>

<pb n="146"/>
<p>The Indian gentleman leaned forward and struck the table with a
long, wasted hand.</p>
<p>"Carmichael," he said, "I must find her.  If she is alive, she is
somewhere.  If she is friendless and penniless, it is through my fault.
How is a man to get back his nerve with a thing like that on his mind?
This sudden change of luck at the mines has made realities of all our
most fantastic dreams, and poor Crewe's child may be begging in the
street!"</p>
<p>"No, no," said Carmichael.  "Try to be calm.  Console yourself
with the fact that when she is found you have a fortune to hand over to
her."</p>
<p>"Why was I not man enough to stand my ground when things
looked black?" Carrisford groaned in petulant misery.  "I believe I
should have stood my ground if I had not been responsible for other
people's money as well as my own.  Poor Crewe had put into the
scheme every penny that he owned.  He trusted me&mdash;he loved me.  And
he died thinking I had ruined him&mdash;I&mdash;Tom Carrisford, who played
cricket at Eton with him.  What a villain he must have thought
me!"</p>
<p>"Don't reproach yourself so bitterly."</p>
<p>"I don't reproach myself because the speculation threatened to
fail&mdash;I reproach myself for losing my courage.  I ran away like a
swindler and a thief, because I could not face my best friend and tell him
I had ruined him and his child."</p>
<p>The good-hearted father of the Large Family put his hand on his
shoulder comfortingly.</p>
<p>"You ran away because your brain had given way under the strain
of mental torture," he said.  "You were half delirious already.  If you
had not been you would have stayed and fought it out.  You were in a
hospital, strapped down in bed, raving with brain fever, two days after
you left the place.  Remember that."</p>
<p>Carrisford dropped his forehead in his hands.</p>

<pb n="147"/>
<p>"Good God!  Yes," he said.  "I was driven mad with dread and
horror.  I had not slept for weeks.  The night I staggered out of my
house all the air seemed full of hideous things mocking and mouthing at
me."</p>
<p>"That is explanation enough in itself," said Mr. Carmichael.
"How could a man on the verge of brain fever judge sanely!"</p>
<p>Carrisford shook his drooping head.</p>
<p>"And when I returned to consciousness poor Crewe was dead&mdash;and
buried.  And I seemed to remember nothing.  I did not remember the
child for months and months.  Even when I began to recall her existence
everything seemed in a sort of haze."</p>
<p>He stopped a moment and rubbed his forehead.  "It sometimes
seems so now when I try to remember.  Surely I must sometime have
heard Crewe speak of the school she was sent to.  Don't you think
so?"</p>
<p>"He might not have spoken of it definitely.  You never seem even
to have heard her real name."</p>
<p>"He used to call her by an odd pet name he had invented.  He
called her his 'Little Missus.'  But the wretched mines drove everything
else out of our heads.  We talked of nothing else.  If he spoke of the
school, I forgot&mdash;I forgot.  And now I shall never remember."</p>
<p>"Come, come," said Carmichael.  "We shall find her yet.  We will
continue to search for Madame Pascal's good-natured Russians.  She
seemed to have a vague idea that they lived in Moscow.  We will take
that as a clue.  I will go to Moscow."</p>
<p>"If I were able to travel, I would go with you," said Carrisford;
"but I can only sit here wrapped in furs and stare at the fire.  And when
I look into it I seem to see Crewe's gay young face gazing back at me.
He looks as if he were

<pb n="148"/> asking me a question.  Sometimes I dream of him at
night, and he always stands before me and asks the same question in
words.  Can you guess what he says, Carmichael?"</p>
<p>Mr. Carmichael answered him in a rather low voice. </p>
<p>"Not exactly," he said.</p>
<p>"He always says, 'Tom, old man&mdash;Tom&mdash;where is the Little
Missus?'"  He caught at Carmichael's hand and clung to it.  "I must be
able to answer him&mdash;I must!" he said.  "Help me to find her.  Help
me."</p>
<p>On the other side of the wall Sara was sitting in her garret talking
to Melchisedec, who had come out for his evening meal.</p>
<p>"It has been hard to be a princess today, Melchisedec," she said.
"It has been harder than usual.  It gets harder as the weather grows
colder and the streets get more sloppy.  When Lavinia laughed at my
muddy skirt as I passed her in the hall, I thought of something to say all
in a flash&mdash;and I only just stopped myself in time.  You can't sneer back
at people like that&mdash;if you are a princess.  But you have to bite your
tongue to hold yourself in.  I bit mine.  It was a cold afternoon,
Melchisedec.  And it's a cold night."</p>
<p>Quite suddenly she put her black head down in her arms, as she
often did when she was alone.</p>
<p>"Oh, papa," she whispered, "what a long time it seems since I was
your 'Little Missus'!"</p>
<p>This was what happened that day on both sides of the wall.
</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="13" id="d17"><pb n="149"/>
<head>One of the Populace</head>
<p>The winter was a wretched one.  There were days on which Sara
tramped through snow when she went on her errands; there were worse
days when the snow melted and combined itself with mud to form slush;
there were others when the fog was so thick that the lamps in the street
were lighted all day and London looked as it had looked the afternoon,
several years ago, when the cab had driven through the thoroughfares
with Sara tucked up on its seat, leaning against her father's shoulder.
On such days the windows of the house of the Large Family always
looked delightfully cozy and alluring, and the study in which the Indian
gentleman sat glowed with warmth and rich color.  But the attic

<pb n="150"/> was dismal beyond words.  There were no longer
sunsets or sunrises to look at, and scarcely ever any stars, it seemed to
Sara.  The clouds hung low over the skylight and were either gray or
mud-color, or dropping heavy rain.  At four o'clock in the afternoon,
even when there was no special fog, the daylight was at an end.  If it
was necessary to go to her attic for anything, Sara was obliged to light a
candle.  The women in the kitchen were depressed, and that made them
more illtempered than ever.  Becky was driven like a little slave.</p>
<p>"'Twarn't for you, miss," she said hoarsely to Sara one night when
she had crept into the attic&mdash;"'twarn't for you, an' the Bastille, an' bein'
the prisoner in the next cell, I should die.  That there does seem real
now, doesn't it?  The missus is more like the head jailer every day she
lives.  I can jest see them big keys you say she carries.  The cook she's
like one of the under-jailers.  Tell me some more, please, miss&mdash;tell me
about the subt'ranean passage we've dug under the walls."</p>
<p>"I'll tell you something warmer," shivered Sara.  "Get your
coverlet and wrap it round you, and I'll get mine, and we will huddle
close together on the bed, and I'll tell you about the tropical forest where
the Indian gentleman's monkey used to live.  When I see him sitting on
the table near the window and looking out into the street with that
mournful expression, I always feel sure he is thinking about the tropical
forest where he used to swing by his tail from coconut trees.  I wonder
who caught him, and if he left a family behind who had depended on
him for coconuts."</p>
<p>"That is warmer, miss," said Becky, gratefully; "but, someways,
even the Bastille is sort of heatin' when you gets to tellin' about
it."</p>
<p>"That is because it makes you think of something else," said Sara,
wrapping the coverlet round her until only her small dark face was to be
seen looking out of it.  "I've noticed

<pb n="151"/> this.  What you have to do with your mind, when your

body is miserable, is to make it think of something else."</p>
<p>"Can you do it, miss?" faltered Becky, regarding her with
admiring eyes.</p>
<p>Sara knitted her brows a moment.</p>
<p>"Sometimes I can and sometimes I can't," she said stoutly.  "But
when I can I'm all right.  And what I believe is that we always could&mdash;if
we practiced enough.  I've been practicing a good deal lately, and it's
beginning to be easier than it used to be.  When things are horrible&mdash;just
horrible&mdash;I think as hard as ever I can of being a princess.  I say to
myself, 'I am a princess, and I am a fairy one, and because I am a fairy
nothing can hurt me or make me uncomfortable.'  You don't know how
it makes you forget"&mdash;with a laugh.</p>
<p>She had many opportunities of making her mind think of
something else, and many opportunities of proving to herself whether or
not she was a princess.  But one of the strongest tests she was ever put
to came on a certain dreadful day which, she often thought afterward,
would never quite fade out of her memory even in the years to
come.</p>
<p>For several days it had rained continuously; the streets were chilly
and sloppy and full of dreary, cold mist; there was mud
everywhere&mdash;sticky London mud&mdash;and over everything the pall of drizzle
and fog.  Of course there were several long and tiresome errands to be
done&mdash;there always were on days like this&mdash;and Sara was sent out again
and again, until her shabby clothes were damp through.  The absurd old
feathers on her forlorn hat were more draggled and absurd than ever,
and her downtrodden shoes were so wet that they could not hold any
more water.  Added to this, she had been deprived of her dinner,
because Miss Minchin had chosen to punish her.  She was so cold and
hungry and tired that her face began to have a pinched look, and now

<pb n="152"/> and then some kind-hearted person passing her in the
street glanced at her with sudden sympathy.  But she did not know that.
She hurried on, trying to make her mind think of something else.  It was
really very necessary.  Her way of doing it was to "pretend" and
"suppose" with all the strength that was left in her.  But really this time
it was harder than she had ever found it, and once or twice she thought it
almost made her more cold and hungry instead of less so.  But she
persevered obstinately, and as the muddy water squelched through her
broken shoes and the wind seemed trying to drag her thin jacket from
her, she talked to herself as she walked, though she did not speak aloud
or even move her lips.</p>
<p>"Suppose I had dry clothes on," she thought.  "Suppose I had good
shoes and a long, thick coat and merino stockings and a whole umbrella.
And suppose&mdash;suppose&mdash;just when I was near a baker's where they sold
hot buns, I should find sixpence&mdash;which belonged to nobody.  Suppose, if
I did, I should go into the shop and buy six of the hottest buns and eat
them all without stopping."</p>
<p>Some very odd things happen in this world sometimes.</p>
<p>It certainly was an odd thing that happened to Sara.  She had to
cross the street just when she was saying this to herself The mud was
dreadful&mdash;she almost had to wade.  She picked her way as carefully as
she could, but she could not save herself much; only, in picking her
way, she had to look down at her feet and the mud, and in looking
down&mdash;just as she reached the pavement&mdash;she saw something shining in
the gutter.  It was actually a piece of silver&mdash;a tiny piece trodden upon by
many feet, but still with spirit enough left to shine a little.  Not quite a
sixpence, but the next thing to it&mdash;a fourpenny piece.</p>
<p>In one second it was in her cold little red-and-blue hand.</p>

<pb n="153"/>
<p>"Oh," she gasped, "it is true!  It is true!"</p>
<p>And then, if you will believe me, she looked straight at the shop
directly facing her.  And it was a baker's shop, and a cheerful, stout,
motherly woman with rosy cheeks was putting into the window a tray of
delicious newly baked hot buns, fresh from the oven&mdash;large, plump,
shiny buns, with currants in them.</p>
<p>It almost made Sara feel faint for a few seconds&mdash;the shock, and
the sight of the buns, and the delightful odors of warm bread floating up
through the baker's cellar window.</p>
<p>She knew she need not hesitate to use the little piece of money.  It
had evidently been lying in the mud for some time, and its owner was
completely lost in the stream of passing people who crowded and jostled
each other all day long.</p>
<p>"But I'll go and ask the baker woman if she has lost anything," she
said to herself, rather faintly.  So she crossed the pavement and put her
wet foot on the step.  As she did so she saw something that made her
stop.</p>
<p>It was a little figure more forlorn even than herself&mdash;a little figure
which was not much more than a bundle of rags, from which small,
bare, red muddy feet peeped out, only because the rags with which their
owner was trying to cover them were not long enough.  Above the rags
appeared a shock head of tangled hair, and a dirty face with big, hollow,
hungry eyes.</p>
<p>Sara knew they were hungry eyes the moment she saw them, and
she felt a sudden sympathy.</p>
<p>"This," she said to herself, with a little sigh, "is one of the
populace&mdash;and she is hungrier than I am."</p>
<p>The child&mdash;this "one of the populace"&mdash;stared up at Sara, and
shuffled herself aside a little, so as to give her room

<pb n="154"/> to pass.  She was used to being made to give room to
everybody.  She knew that if a policeman chanced to see her he would
tell her to "move on."</p>
<p>Sara clutched her little fourpenny piece and hesitated for a few
seconds.  Then she spoke to her.</p>
<p>"Are you hungry?" she asked.</p>
<p>The child shuffled herself and her rags a little more.</p>
<p>"Ain't I jist?" she said in a hoarse voice.  "Jist ain't I?"</p>
<p>"Haven't you had any dinner?" said Sara.</p>
<p>"No dinner," more hoarsely still and with more shuffling.  "Nor
yet no bre'fast&mdash;nor yet no supper.  No nothin'.</p>
<p>"Since when?" asked Sara.</p>
<p>"Dunno.  Never got nothin' today&mdash;nowhere.  I've axed an'
axed."</p>
<p>Just to look at her made Sara more hungry and faint.  But those
queer little thoughts were at work in her brain, and she was talking to
herself, though she was sick at heart.</p>
<p>"If I'm a princess," she was saying, "if I'm a princess&mdash;when they
were poor and driven from their thrones&mdash;they always shared&mdash;with the
populace&mdash;if they met one poorer and hungrier than themselves.  They
always shared.  Buns are a penny each.  If it had been sixpence I could
have eaten six.  It won't be enough for either of us.  But it will be better
than nothing."</p>
<p>"Wait a minute," she said to the beggar child.</p>
<p>She went into the shop.  It was warm and smelled deliciously.
The woman was just going to put some more hot buns into the
window.</p>
<p>"If you please," said Sara, "have you lost fourpence&mdash;a silver
fourpence?"  And she held the forlorn little piece of money out to
her.</p>
<p>The woman looked at it and then at her&mdash;at her intense little face
and draggled, once fine clothes.</p>
<p>"Bless us, no," she answered.  "Did you find it?"</p>

<pb n="155"/>
<p>"Yes," said Sara.  "In the gutter."</p>
<p>"Keep it, then," said the woman.  "It may have been there for a
week, and goodness knows who lost it.  You could never find
out."</p>
<p>"I know that," said Sara, "but I thought I would ask you."</p>
<p>"Not many would," said the woman, looking puzzled and
interested and good-natured all at once.</p>
<p>"Do you want to buy something?" she added, as she saw Sara
glance at the buns.</p>
<p>"Four buns, if you please," said Sara.  "Those at a penny
each."</p>
<p>The woman went to the window and put some in a paper
bag.</p>
<p>Sara noticed that she put in six.</p>
<p>"I said four, if you please," she explained.  "I have only
fourpence."</p>
<p>"I'll throw in two for makeweight," said the woman with her
good-natured look.  "I dare say you can eat them sometime.  Aren't you
hungry?"</p>
<p>A mist rose before Sara's eyes.</p>
<p>"Yes," she answered.  "I am very hungry, and I am much obliged
to you for your kindness; and"&mdash;she was going to add&mdash;"there is a child
outside who is hungrier than I am." But just at that moment two or three
customers came in at once, and each one seemed in a hurry, so she
could only thank the woman again and go out.</p>
<p>The beggar girl was still huddled up in the corner of the step.  She
looked frightful in her wet and dirty rags.  She was staring straight
before her with a stupid look of suffering, and Sara saw her suddenly
draw the back of her roughened black hand across her eyes to rub away
the tears which seemed to have surprised her by forcing their way from
under her lids.  She was muttering to herself.  </p>

<pb n="156"/>
<p>Sara opened the paper bag and took out one of the hot buns, which
had already warmed her own cold hands a little.</p>
<p>"See," she said, putting the bun in the ragged lap, "this is nice and
hot.  Eat it, and you will not feel so hungry."</p>
<p>The child started and stared up at her, as if such sudden, amazing
good luck almost frightened her; then she snatched up the bun and began
to cram it into her mouth with great wolfish bites.</p>
<p>"Oh, my!  Oh, my!" Sara heard her say hoarsely, in wild delight.
"Oh, my!"</p>
<p>Sara took out three more buns and put them down.</p>
<p>The sound in the hoarse, ravenous voice was awful.</p>
<p>"She is hungrier than I am," she said to herself.  "She's starving."
But her hand trembled when she put down the fourth bun.  "I'm not
starving," she said&mdash;and she put down the fifth.</p>
<p>The little ravening London savage was still snatching and
devouring when she turned away. She was too ravenous to give any
thanks, even if she had ever been taught politeness&mdash;which she had not.
She was only a poor little wild animal.</p>
<p>"Good-bye," said Sara.</p>
<p>When she reached the other side of the street she looked back.
The child had a bun in each hand and had stopped in the middle of a bite
to watch her.  Sara gave her a little nod, and the child, after another
stare&mdash;a curious lingering stare&mdash;jerked her shaggy head in response, and
until Sara was out of sight she did not take another bite or even finish
the one she had begun.</p>
<p>At that moment the baker-woman looked out of her shop
window.</p>
<p>"Well, I never!" she exclaimed.  "If that young un hasn't given her
buns to a beggar child!  It wasn't because she didn't

<pb n="157"/> want them, either.  Well, well, she looked hungry
enough. I'd give something to know what she did it for."</p>
<p>She stood behind her window for a few moments and pondered.
Then her curiosity got the better of her.  She went to the door and spoke
to the beggar child.</p>
<p>"Who gave you those buns?" she asked her. The child nodded her
head toward Sara's vanishing figure.</p>
<p>"What did she say?" inquired the woman.</p>
<p>"Axed me if I was 'ungry," replied the hoarse voice.</p>
<p>"What did you say?"</p>
<p>"Said I was jist."</p>
<p>"And then she came in and got the buns, and gave them to you,
did she?"</p>
<p>The child nodded.</p>
<p>"How many?"</p>
<p>"Five."</p>
<p>The woman thought it over.</p>
<p>"Left just one for herself," she said in a low voice.  "And she
could have eaten the whole six&mdash;I saw it in her eyes."</p>
<p>She looked after the little draggled far-away figure and felt more
disturbed in her usually comfortable mind than she had felt for many a
day.</p>
<p>"I wish she hadn't gone so quick," she said.  "I'm blest if she
shouldn't have had a dozen."  Then she turned to the child.</p>
<p>"Are you hungry yet?" she said.</p>
<p>"I'm allus hungry," was the answer, "but 't ain't as bad as it
was."</p>
<p>"Come in here," said the woman, and she held open the shop
door.</p>
<p>The child got up and shuffled in.  To be invited into a warm place
full of bread seemed an incredible thing.  She
<pb n="158"/>
<pb n="159"/> did not know what was going to happen.  She did not
care, even.</p>
<p>"Get yourself warm," said the woman, pointing to a fire in the tiny
back room.  "And look here; when you are hard up for a bit of bread,
you can come in here and ask for it. I'm blest if I won't give it to you
for that young one's sake."</p>
<p>Sara found some comfort in her remaining bun.  At all events, it
was very hot, and it was better than nothing.  As she walked along she
broke off small pieces and ate them slowly to make them last
longer.</p>
<p>"Suppose it was a magic bun," she said, "and a bite was as much
as a whole dinner.  I should be overeating myself if I went on like
this."</p>
<p>It was dark when she reached the square where the Select
Seminary was situated.  The lights in the houses were all lighted.  The
blinds were not yet drawn in the windows of the room where she nearly
always caught glimpses of members of the Large Family.  Frequently at
this hour she could see the gentleman she called Mr. Montmorency
sitting in a big chair, with a small swarm round him, talking, laughing,
perching on the arms of his seat or on his knees or leaning against them.
This evening the swarm was about him, but he was not seated.  On the
contrary, there was a good deal of excitement going on.  It was evident
that a journey was to be taken, and it was Mr. Montmorency who was to
take it.  A brougham stood before the door, and a big portmanteau had
been strapped upon it.  The children were dancing about, chattering and
hanging on to their father.  The pretty rosy mother was standing near
him, talking as if she was asking final questions.  Sara paused a moment
to see the little ones lifted up and kissed and the bigger ones bent over
and kissed also.</p>

<pb n="160"/>
<p>"I wonder if he will stay away long," she thought.  "The
portmanteau is rather big.  Oh, dear, how they will miss him! I shall
miss him myself&mdash;even though he doesn't know I am alive."</p>
<p>When the door opened she moved away&mdash;remembering the
sixpence&mdash;but she saw the traveler come out and stand against the
background of the warmly-lighted hall, the older children still hovering
about him.</p>
<p>"Will Moscow be covered with snow?" said the little girl Janet.
"Will there be ice everywhere?"</p>
<p>"Shall you drive in a drosky?" cried another.  "Shall you see the
Czar?"</p>
<p>"I will write and tell you all about it," he answered, laughing.
"And I will send you pictures of muzhiks and things.  Run into the
house.  It is a hideous damp night.  I would rather stay with you than go
to Moscow.  Good night! Good night, duckies!  God bless you!"  And he
ran down the steps and jumped into the brougham.</p>
<p>"If you find the little girl, give her our love," shouted Guy
Clarence, jumping up and down on the door mat.</p>
<p>Then they went in and shut the door.</p>
<p>"Did you see," said Janet to Nora, as they went back to the
room&mdash;"the little-girl-who-is-not-a-beggar was passing?  She looked all
cold and wet, and I saw her turn her head over her shoulder and look at
us.  Mamma says her clothes always look as if they had been given her
by someone who was quite rich&mdash;someone who only let her have them
because they were too shabby to wear.  The people at the school always
send her out on errands on the horridest days and nights there
are."</p>
<p>Sara crossed the square to Miss Minchin's area steps, feeling faint
and shaky.</p>
<p>"I wonder who the little girl is," she thought&mdash;"the little girl he is
going to look for."  </p>

<pb n="161"/>
<p>And she went down the area steps, lugging her basket and finding
it very heavy indeed, as the father of the Large Family drove quickly on
his way to the station to take the train which was to carry him to
Moscow, where he was to make his best efforts to search for the lost
little daughter of Captain Crewe.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="14" id="d18"><pb n="162"/>
<head>What Melchisedec Heard and Saw</head>
<p>On this very afternoon, while Sara was out, a strange thing
happened in the attic.  Only Melchisedec saw and heard it; and he was
so much alarmed and mystified that he scuttled back to his hole and hid
there, and really quaked and trembled as he peeped out furtively and
with great caution to watch what was going on.</p>
<p>The attic had been very still all the day after Sara had left it in the
early morning.  The stillness had only been broken by the pattering of
the rain upon the slates and the skylight.  Melchisedec had, in fact,
found it rather dull; and when the rain ceased to patter and perfect
silence reigned, he decided to come out and reconnoiter, though
experience

<pb n="163"/> taught him that Sara would not return for some time.
He had been rambling and sniffing about, and had just found a totally
unexpected and unexplained crumb left from his last meal, when his
attention was attracted by a sound on the roof.  He stopped to listen with
a palpitating heart.  The sound suggested that something was moving on
the roof.  It was approaching the skylight; it reached the skylight.  The
skylight was being mysteriously opened.  A dark face peered into the
attic; then another face appeared behind it, and both looked in with signs
of caution and interest.  Two men were outside on the roof, and were
making silent preparations to enter through the skylight itself.  One was
Ram Dass and the other was a young man who was the Indian
gentleman's secretary; but of course Melchisedec did not know this.  He
only knew that the men were invading the silence and privacy of the
attic; and as the one with the dark face let himself down through the
aperture with such lightness and dexterity that he did not make the
slightest sound, Melchisedec turned tail and fled precipitately back to his
hole.  He was frightened to death.  He had ceased to be timid with Sara,
and knew she would never throw anything but crumbs, and would never
make any sound other than the soft, low, coaxing whistling; but strange
men were dangerous things to remain near.  He lay close and flat near
the entrance of his home, just managing to peep through the crack with a
bright, alarmed eye.  How much he understood of the talk he heard I am
not in the least able to say; but, even if he had understood it all, he
would probably have remained greatly mystified.</p>
<p>The secretary, who was light and young, slipped through the
skylight as noiselessly as Ram Dass had done; and he caught a last
glimpse of Melchisedec's vanishing tail.</p>
<p>"Was that a rat?" he asked Ram Dass in a whisper.</p>

<pb n="164"/>
<p>"Yes; a rat, Sahib," answered Ram Dass, also whispering.  "There
are many in the walls."</p>
<p>"Ugh!" exclaimed the young man.  "It is a wonder the child is not
terrified of them."</p>
<p>Ram Dass made a gesture with his hands.  He also smiled
respectfully.  He was in this place as the intimate exponent of Sara,
though she had only spoken to him once.</p>
<p>"The child is the little friend of all things, Sahib," he answered.
"She is not as other children.  I see her when she does not see me.  I
slip across the slates and look at her many nights to see that she is safe.
I watch her from my window when she does not know I am near.  She
stands on the table there and looks out at the sky as if it spoke to her.
The sparrows come at her call.  The rat she has fed and tamed in her
loneliness.  The poor slave of the house comes to her for comfort.
There is a little child who comes to her in secret; there is one older who
worships her and would listen to her forever if she might.  This I have
seen when I have crept across the roof.  By the mistress of the
house&mdash;who is an evil woman&mdash;she is treated like a pariah; but she has the
bearing of a child who is of the blood of kings!"</p>
<p>"You seem to know a great deal about her," the secretary
said.</p>
<p>"All her life each day I know," answered Ram Dass.  "Her going
out I know, and her coming in; her sadness and her poor joys; her
coldness and her hunger.  I know when she is alone until midnight,
learning from her books; I know when her secret friends steal to her and
she is happier&mdash;as children can be, even in the midst of poverty&mdash;because
they come and she may laugh and talk with them in whispers.  If she
were ill I should know, and I would come and serve her if it might be
done."</p>
<p>"You are sure no one comes near this place but herself,

<pb n="165"/> and that she will not return and surprise us.  She would
be frightened if she found us here, and the Sahib Carrisford's plan would
be spoiled."</p>
<p>Ram Dass crossed noiselessly to the door and stood close to
it.</p>
<p>"None mount here but herself, Sahib," he said.  "She has gone out
with her basket and may be gone for hours.  If I stand here I can hear
any step before it reaches the last flight of the stairs."</p>
<p>The secretary took a pencil and a tablet from his breast
pocket.</p>
<p>"Keep your ears open," he said; and he began to walk slowly and
softly round the miserable little room, making rapid notes on his tablet
as he looked at things.</p>
<p>First he went to the narrow bed.  He pressed his hand upon the
mattress and uttered an exclamation.</p>
<p>"As hard as a stone," he said.  "That will have to be altered some
day when she is out.  A special journey can be made to bring it across.
It cannot be done tonight."  He lifted the covering and examined the one
thin pillow.</p>
<p>"Coverlet dingy and worn, blanket thin, sheets patched and
ragged," he said.  "What a bed for a child to sleep in&mdash;and in a house
which calls itself respectable!  There has not been a fire in that grate for
many a day," glancing at the rusty fireplace.</p>
<p>"Never since I have seen it," said Ram Dass.  "The mistress of the
house is not one who remembers that another than herself may be
cold."</p>
<p>The secretary was writing quickly on his tablet.  He looked up
from it as he tore off a leaf and slipped it into his breast pocket.</p>
<p>"It is a strange way of doing the thing," he said.  "Who planned
it?"</p>

<pb n="166"/>
<p>Ram Dass made a modestly apologetic obeisance.</p>
<p>"It is true that the first thought was mine, Sahib," he said; "though
it was naught but a fancy.  I am fond of this child; we are both lonely.
It is her way to relate her visions to her secret friends.  Being sad one
night, I lay close to the open skylight and listened.  The vision she
related told what this miserable room might be if it had comforts in it.
She seemed to see it as she talked, and she grew cheered and warmed as
she spoke.  Then she came to this fancy; and the next day, the Sahib
being ill and wretched, I told him of the thing to amuse him.  It seemed
then but a dream, but it pleased the Sahib.  To hear of the child's doings
gave him entertainment.  He became interested in her and asked
questions.  At last he began to please himself with the thought of making
her visions real things."</p>
<p>"You think that it can be done while she sleeps?  Suppose she
awakened," suggested the secretary; and it was evident that whatsoever
the plan referred to was, it had caught and pleased his fancy as well as
the Sahib Carrisford's.</p>
<p>"I can move as if my feet were of velvet," Ram Dass replied; "and
children sleep soundly&mdash;even the unhappy ones. I could have entered this
room in the night many times, and without causing her to turn upon her
pillow.  If the other bearer passes to me the things through the window,
I can do all and she will not stir.  When she awakens she will think a
magician has been here."</p>
<p>He smiled as if his heart warmed under his white robe, and the
secretary smiled back at him.</p>
<p>"It will be like a story from the Arabian Nights,"  he said.  "Only
an Oriental could have planned it.  It does not belong to London
fogs."</p>
<p>They did not remain very long, to the great relief of Melchisedec,
who, as he probably did not comprehend their

<pb n="167"/> conversation, felt their movements and whispers
ominous.  The young secretary seemed interested in everything.  He
wrote down things about the floor, the fireplace, the broken footstool,
the old table, the walls&mdash;which last he touched with his hand again and
again, seeming much pleased when he found that a number of old nails
had been driven in various places.</p>
<p>"You can hang things on them," he said.</p>
<p>Ram Dass smiled mysteriously.</p>
<p>"Yesterday, when she was out," he said, "I entered, bringing with
me small, sharp nails which can be pressed into the wall without blows
from a hammer.  I placed many in the plaster where I may need them.
They are ready."</p>
<p>The Indian gentleman's secretary stood still and looked round him
as he thrust his tablets back into his pocket.</p>
<p>"I think I have made notes enough; we can go now," he said.
"The Sahib Carrisford has a warm heart.  It is a thousand pities that he
has not found the lost child."</p>
<p>"If he should find her his strength would be restored to him," said
Ram Dass.  "His God may lead her to him yet."</p>
<p>Then they slipped through the skylight as noiselessly as they had
entered it.  And, after he was quite sure they had gone, Melchisedec was
greatly relieved, and in the course of a few minutes felt it safe to emerge
from his hole again and scuffle about in the hope that even such alarming
human beings as these might have chanced to carry crumbs in their
pockets and drop one or two of them.</p>
</div1>


<div1 type="chapter" n="15" id="d19"><pb n="168"/>
<head>The Magic</head>
<p>When Sara had passed the house next door she had seen Ram Dass
closing the shutters, and caught her glimpse of this room also.</p>
<p>"It is a long time since I saw a nice place from the inside," was
the thought which crossed her mind.</p>
<p>There was the usual bright fire glowing in the grate, and the Indian
gentleman was sitting before it.  His head was resting in his hand, and
he looked as lonely and unhappy as ever.</p>
<p>"Poor man!" said Sara.  "I wonder what you are
supposing."</p>
<p>And this was what he was "supposing" at that very moment.</p>


<pb n="169"/>
<p>"Suppose," he was thinking, "suppose&mdash;even if Carmichael traces
the people to Moscow&mdash;the little girl they took from Madame Pascal's
school in Paris is not the one we are in search of.  Suppose she proves to
be quite a different child.  What steps shall I take next?"</p>
<p>When Sara went into the house she met Miss Minchin, who had
come downstairs to scold the cook.</p>
<p>"Where have you wasted your time?" she demanded.  "You have
been out for hours."</p>
<p>"It was so wet and muddy," Sara answered, "it was hard to walk,
because my shoes were so bad and slipped about."</p>
<p>"Make no excuses," said Miss Minchin, "and tell no
falsehoods."</p>
<p>Sara went in to the cook.  The cook had received a severe lecture
and was in a fearful temper as a result.  She was only too rejoiced to
have someone to vent her rage on, and Sara was a convenience, as
usual.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you stay all night?" she snapped.</p>
<p>Sara laid her purchases on the table.</p>
<p>"Here are the things," she said.</p>
<p>The cook looked them over, grumbling.  She was in a very savage
humor indeed.</p>
<p>"May I have something to eat?" Sara asked rather faintly.</p>
<p>"Tea's over and done with," was the answer.  "Did you expect me
to keep it hot for you?"</p>
<p>Sara stood silent for a second.</p>
<p>"I had no dinner," she said next, and her voice was quite low.
She made it low because she was afraid it would tremble.</p>
<p>"There's some bread in the pantry," said the cook.  "That's all
you'll get at this time of day."</p>
<p>Sara went and found the bread.  It was old and hard and

<pb n="170"/>   dry.  The cook was in too vicious a humor to give her
anything to eat with it.  It was always safe and easy to vent her spite on
Sara.  Really, it was hard for the child to climb the three long flights of
stairs leading to her attic.  She often found them long and steep when
she was tired; but tonight it seemed as if she would never reach the top.
Several times she was obliged to stop to rest.  When she reached the top
landing she was glad to see the glimmer of a light coming from under
her door.  That meant that Ermengarde had managed to creep up to pay
her a visit.  There was some comfort in that.  It was better than to go
into the room alone and find it empty and desolate.  The mere presence
of plump, comfortable Ermengarde, wrapped in her red shawl, would
warm it a little.</p>
<p>Yes; there Ermengarde was when she opened the door.  She was
sitting in the middle of the bed, with her feet tucked safely under her.
She had never become intimate with Melchisedec and his family, though
they rather fascinated her.  When she found herself alone in the attic she
always preferred to sit on the bed until Sara arrived.  She had, in fact,
on this occasion had time to become rather nervous, because
Melchisedec had appeared and sniffed about a good deal, and once had
made her utter a repressed squeal by sitting up on his hind legs and,
while he looked at her, sniffing pointedly in her direction.</p>
<p>"Oh, Sara," she cried out, "I am glad you have come.  Melchy
would sniff about so.  I tried to coax him to go back, but he wouldn't
for such a long time.  I like him, you know; but it does frighten me
when he sniffs right at me.  Do you think he ever would jump?"</p>
<p>"No," answered Sara.</p>
<p>Ermengarde crawled forward on the bed to look at her. </p>
<p>"You do look tired, Sara," she said; "you are quite pale."</p>
<p>"I am tired," said Sara, dropping on to the lopsided

<pb n="171"/> footstool.  "Oh, there's Melchisedec, poor thing.  He's
come to ask for his supper."</p>
<p>Melchisedec had come out of his hole as if he had been listening
for her footstep.  Sara was quite sure he knew it.  He came forward with
an affectionate, expectant expression as Sara put her hand in her pocket
and turned it inside out, shaking her head.</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry," she said.  "I haven't one crumb left.  Go home,
Melchisedec, and tell your wife there was nothing in my pocket.  I'm
afraid I forgot because the cook and Miss Minchin were so
cross."</p>
<p>Melchisedec seemed to understand.  He shuffled resignedly, if not
contentedly, back to his home.</p>
<p>"I did not expect to see you tonight, Ermie," Sara said.
Ermengarde hugged herself in the red shawl.</p>
<p>"Miss Amelia has gone out to spend the night with her old aunt,"
she explained.  "No one else ever comes and looks into the bedrooms
after we are in bed.  I could stay here until morning if I wanted
to."</p>
<p>She pointed toward the table under the skylight.  Sara had not
looked toward it as she came in.  A number of books were piled upon it.
Ermengarde's gesture was a dejected one.</p>
<p>"Papa has sent me some more books, Sara," she said.  "There they
are."</p>
<p>Sara looked round and got up at once.  She ran to the table, and
picking up the top volume, turned over its leaves quickly.  For the
moment she forgot her discomforts.</p>
<p>"Ah," she cried out, "how beautiful!  Carlyle's French Revolution.
I have so wanted to read that!"</p>
<p>"I haven't," said Ermengarde.  "And papa will be so cross if I
don't.  He'll expect me to know all about it when I go home for the
holidays.  What shall I do?"</p>
<p>Sara stopped turning over the leaves and looked at her with an
excited flush on her cheeks.  </p>

<pb n="172"/>
<p>"Look here," she cried, "if you'll lend me these books, I'll read
them&mdash;and tell you everything that's in them afterward&mdash;and I'll tell it so
that you will remember it, too."</p>
<p>"Oh, goodness!" exclaimed Ermengarde.  "Do you think you
can?"</p>
<p>"I know I can," Sara answered.  "The little ones always remember
what I tell them."</p>
<p>"Sara," said Ermengarde, hope gleaming in her round face, "if
you'll do that, and make me remember, I'll&mdash;I'll give you
anything."</p>
<p>"I don't want you to give me anything," said Sara.  "I want your
books&mdash;I want them!"  And her eyes grew big, and her chest
heaved.</p>
<p>"Take them,  then," said Ermengarde.  "I wish I wanted them&mdash;but
I don't.  I'm not clever, and my father is, and he thinks I ought to
be."</p>
<p>Sara was opening one book after the other.  "What are you going
to tell your father?" she asked, a slight doubt dawning in her
mind.</p>
<p>"Oh, he needn't know," answered Ermengarde.  "He'll think I've
read them."</p>
<p>Sara put down her book and shook her head slowly.  "That's
almost like telling lies," she said.  "And lies&mdash;well, you see, they are not
only wicked&mdash;they're vulgar.  Sometimes"&mdash;reflectively&mdash;"I've thought
perhaps I might do something wicked&mdash;I might suddenly fly into a rage
and kill Miss Minchin, you know, when she was ill-treating me&mdash;but I
couldn't be vulgar.  Why can't you tell your father I read them?"</p>

<p>"He wants me to read them," said Ermengarde, a little discouraged
by this unexpected turn of affairs.</p>
<p>"He wants you to know what is in them," said Sara.  "And if I can
tell it to you in an easy way and make you remember it, I should think
he would like that." </p>

<pb n="173"/>
<p>"He'll like it if I learn anything in any way," said rueful
Ermengarde.  "You would if you were my father."</p>
<p>"It's not your fault that&mdash;" began Sara.  She pulled herself up and
stopped rather suddenly.  She had been going to say, "It's not your fault
that you are stupid."</p>
<p>"That what?" Ermengarde asked.</p>
<p>"That you can't learn things quickly," amended Sara.  "If you
can't, you can't.  If I can&mdash;why, I can; that's all."</p>
<p>She always felt very tender of Ermengarde, and tried not to let her
feel too strongly the difference between being able to learn anything at
once, and not being able to learn anything at all.  As she looked at her
plump face, one of her wise, old-fashioned thoughts came to her.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she said, "to be able to learn things quickly isn't
everything.  To be kind is worth a great deal to other people.  If Miss
Minchin knew everything on earth and was like what she is now, she'd
still be a detestable thing, and everybody would hate her.  Lots of clever
people have done harm and have been wicked.  Look at
Robespierre&mdash;"</p>
<p>She stopped and examined Ermengarde's countenance, which was
beginning to look bewildered.  "Don't you remember?" she demanded.
"I told you about him not long ago.  I believe you've forgotten."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't remember all of it," admitted Ermengarde.</p>
<p>"Well, you wait a minute," said Sara, "and I'll take off my wet
things and wrap myself in the coverlet and tell you over again."</p>
<p>She took off her hat and coat and hung them on a nail against the
wall, and she changed her wet shoes for an old pair of slippers.  Then
she jumped on the bed, and drawing the coverlet about her shoulders, sat
with her arms round her knees.     "Now, listen," she said.</p>

<pb n="174"/>
<p>She plunged into the gory records of the French Revolution, and
told such stories of it that Ermengarde's eyes grew round with alarm and
she held her breath.  But though she was rather terrified, there was a
delightful thrill in listening, and she was not likely to forget Robespierre
again, or to have any doubts about the Princesse de Lamballe.</p>
<p>"You know they put her head on a pike and danced round it," Sara
explained.  "And she had beautiful floating blonde hair; and when I think
of her, I never see her head on her body, but always on a pike, with
those furious people dancing and howling."</p>
<p>It was agreed that Mr. St. John was to be told the plan they had
made, and for the present the books were to be left in the attic.</p>
<p>"Now let's tell each other things," said Sara.  "How are you
getting on with your French lessons?"</p>
<p>"Ever so much better since the last time I came up here and you
explained the conjugations.  Miss Minchin could not understand why I
did my exercises so well that first morning."</p>
<p>Sara laughed a little and hugged her knees.</p>
<p>"She doesn't understand why Lottie is doing her sums so well,"
she said; "but it is because she creeps up here, too, and I help her."  She
glanced round the room.  "The attic would be rather nice&mdash;if it wasn't so
dreadful," she said, laughing again.  "It's a good place to pretend
in."</p>
<p>The truth was that Ermengarde did not know anything of the
sometimes almost unbearable side of life in the attic and she had not a
sufficiently vivid imagination to depict it for herself.  On the rare
occasions that she could reach Sara's room she only saw the side of it
which was made exciting by things which were "pretended" and stories
which were told.  Her visits partook of the character of adventures; and

<pb n="175"/> though sometimes Sara looked rather pale, and it was
not to be denied that she had grown very thin, her proud little spirit
would not admit of complaints.  She had never confessed that at times
she was almost ravenous with hunger, as she was tonight.  She was
growing rapidly, and her constant walking and running about would have
given her a keen appetite even if she had had abundant and regular meals
of a much more nourishing nature than the unappetizing, inferior food
snatched at such odd times as suited the kitchen convenience.  She was
growing used to a certain gnawing feeling in her young stomach.</p>
<p>"I suppose soldiers feel like this when they are on a long and
weary march," she often said to herself.  She liked the sound of the
phrase, "long and weary march."  It made her feel rather like a soldier.
She had also a quaint sense of being a hostess in the attic.</p>
<p>"If I lived in a castle," she argued, "and Ermengarde was the lady
of another castle, and came to see me, with knights and squires and
vassals riding with her, and pennons flying, when I heard the clarions
sounding outside the drawbridge I should go down to receive her, and I
should spread feasts in the banquet hall and call in minstrels to sing and
play and relate romances.  When she comes into the attic I can't spread
feasts, but I can tell stories, and not let her know disagreeable things.  I
dare say poor chatelaines had to do that in time of famine, when their
lands had been pillaged." She was a proud, brave little chatelaine, and
dispensed generously the one hospitality she could offer&mdash;the dreams she
dreamed&mdash;the visions she saw&mdash;the imaginings which were her joy and
comfort.</p>
<p>So, as they sat together, Ermengarde did not know that she was
faint as well as ravenous, and that while she talked she now and then
wondered if her hunger would let her sleep

<pb n="176"/> when she was left alone.  She felt as if she had never
been quite so hungry before.</p>
<p>"I wish I was as thin as you, Sara," Ermengarde said suddenly.  "I
believe you are thinner than you used to be.  Your eyes look so big, and
look at the sharp little bones sticking out of your elbow!"</p>
<p>Sara pulled down her sleeve, which had pushed itself up.</p>
<p>"I always was a thin child," she said bravely, "and I always had
big green eyes."</p>
<p>"I love your queer eyes," said Ermengarde, looking into them with
affectionate admiration.  "They always look as if they saw such a long
way.  I love them&mdash;and I love them to be green&mdash;though they look black
generally."</p>
<p>"They are cat's eyes," laughed Sara; "but I can't see in the dark
with them&mdash;because I have tried, and I couldn't&mdash;I wish I could."</p>
<p>It was just at this minute that something happened at the skylight
which neither of them saw.  If either of them had chanced to turn and
look, she would have been startled by the sight of a dark face which
peered cautiously into the room and disappeared as quickly and almost as
silently as it had appeared.  Not quite as silently, however.  Sara, who
had keen ears, suddenly turned a little and looked up at the roof.</p>
<p>"That didn't sound like Melchisedec," she said.  "It wasn't
scratchy enough."</p>
<p>"What?" said Ermengarde, a little startled.</p>
<p>"Didn't you think you heard something?" asked Sara.</p>
<p>"N-no," Ermengarde faltered.  "Did you?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps I didn't," said Sara; "but I thought I did.  It sounded as
if something was on the slates&mdash;something that dragged softly."  </p>

<pb n="177"/>
<p>"What could it be?" said Ermengarde.  "Could it
be&mdash;robbers?"</p>
<p>"No," Sara began cheerfully.  "There is nothing to steal&mdash;"</p>
<p>She broke off in the middle of her words.  They both heard the
sound that checked her.  It was not on the slates, but on the stairs below,
and it was Miss Minchin's angry voice.  Sara sprang off the bed, and put
out the candle.</p>
<p>"She is scolding Becky," she whispered, as she stood in the
darkness.  "She is making her cry."</p>
<p>"Will she come in here?" Ermengarde whispered back,
panic-stricken.</p>
<p>"No.  She will think I am in bed.  Don't stir."</p>
<p>It was very seldom that Miss Minchin mounted the last flight of
stairs.  Sara could only remember that she had done it once before.  But
now she was angry enough to be coming at least part of the way up, and
it sounded as if she was driving Becky before her.</p>
<p>"You  impudent, dishonest child!" they heard her say. "Cook tells
me she has missed things repeatedly."</p>
<p>"'T warn't me, mum," said Becky sobbing.  "I was 'ungry
enough, but 't warn't me&mdash;never!"</p>
<p>"You deserve to be sent to prison," said Miss Minchin's voice.
"Picking and stealing!  Half a meat pie, indeed!"</p>
<p>"'T warn't me," wept Becky.  "I could 'ave eat a whole un&mdash;but I
never laid a finger on it."</p>
<p>Miss Minchin was out of breath between temper and mounting the
stairs.  The meat pie had been intended for her special late supper.  It
became apparent that she boxed Becky's ears.</p>
<p>"Don't tell falsehoods," she said.  "Go to your room this
instant."</p>
<p>Both Sara and Ermengarde heard the slap, and then

<pb n="178"/> heard Becky run in her slipshod shoes up the stairs and
into her attic.  They heard her door shut, and knew that she threw
herself upon her bed.</p>
<p>"I could 'ave e't two of 'em," they heard her cry into her pillow.
"An' I never took a bite.  'T was cook give it to her policeman."</p>

<p>Sara stood in the middle of the room in the darkness.  She was
clenching her little teeth and opening and shutting fiercely her
outstretched hands.  She could scarcely stand still, but she dared not
move until Miss Minchin had gone down the stairs and all was
still.</p>
<p>"The wicked, cruel thing!" she burst forth.  "The cook takes things
herself and then says Becky steals them.  She doesn't!  She doesn't!
She's so hungry sometimes that she eats crusts out of the ash barrel!"
She pressed her hands hard against her face and burst into passionate
little sobs, and Ermengarde, hearing this unusual thing, was overawed by
it.  Sara was crying!  The unconquerable Sara!  It seemed to denote
something new&mdash;some mood she had never known.  Suppose&mdash;suppose&mdash;a
new dread possibility presented itself to her kind, slow, little mind all at
once.  She crept off the bed in the dark and found her way to the table
where the candle stood.  She struck a match and lit the candle.  When
she had lighted it, she bent forward and looked at Sara, with her new
thought growing to definite fear in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Sara," she said in a timid, almost awe-stricken voice,
are&mdash;are&mdash;you never told me&mdash;I don't want to be rude, but&mdash;are you ever
hungry?"</p>
<p>It was too much just at that moment.  The barrier broke down.
Sara lifted her face from her hands.</p>
<p>"Yes," she said in a new passionate way.  "Yes, I am.  I'm so
hungry now that I could almost eat you.  And it makes it worse to hear
poor Becky.  She's hungrier than I am."  </p>

<pb n="179"/>
<p>Ermengarde gasped.</p>
<p>"Oh, oh!" she cried woefully.  "And I never knew!"</p>
<p>"I didn't want you to know," Sara said.  "It would have made me
feel like a street beggar.  I know I look like a street beggar."</p>
<p>"No, you don't&mdash;you don't!" Ermengarde broke in.  "Your clothes
are a little queer&mdash;but you couldn't look like a street beggar.  You
haven't a street-beggar face."</p>
<p>"A little boy once gave me a sixpence for charity," said Sara, with
a short little laugh in spite of herself.  "Here it is." And she pulled out
the thin ribbon from her neck.  "He wouldn't have given me his
Christmas sixpence if I hadn't looked as if I needed it."</p>
<p>Somehow the sight of the dear little sixpence was good for both of
them.  It made them laugh a little, though they both had tears in their
eyes.</p>
<p>"Who was he?" asked Ermengarde, looking at it quite as if it had
not been a mere ordinary silver sixpence.</p>
<p>"He was a darling little thing going to a party," said Sara.  " He
was one of the Large Family, the little one with the round legs&mdash;the one I
call Guy Clarence.  I suppose his nursery was crammed with Christmas
presents and hampers full of cakes and things, and he could see I had
nothing."</p>
<p>Ermengarde gave a little jump backward.  The last sentences had
recalled something to her troubled mind and given her a sudden
inspiration.</p>
<p>"Oh, Sara!" she cried.  "What a silly thing I am not to have
thought of it!"</p>
<p>"Of what?"</p>
<p>"Something splendid!" said Ermengarde, in an excited hurry.
"This very afternoon my nicest aunt sent me a box.  It is full of good
things.  I never touched it, I had so much

<pb n="180"/> pudding at dinner, and I was so bothered about papa's
books." Her words began to tumble over each other.  "It's got cake in it,
and little meat pies, and jam tarts and buns, and oranges and red-currant
wine, and figs and chocolate.  I'll creep back to my room and get it this
minute, and we'll eat it now."</p>
<p>Sara almost reeled.  When one is faint with hunger the mention of
food has sometimes a curious effect.  She clutched Ermengarde's
arm.</p>
<p>"Do you think&mdash;you could?" she ejaculated.</p>
<p>"I know I could," answered Ermengarde, and she ran to the
door&mdash;opened it softly&mdash;put her head out into the darkness, and listened.
Then she went back to Sara.  "The lights are out.  Everybody's in bed.
I can creep&mdash;and creep&mdash;and no one will hear."</p>
<p>It was so delightful that they caught each other's hands and a
sudden light sprang into Sara's eyes.</p>
<p>"Ermie!" she said.  "Let us pretend!  Let us pretend it's a party!
And oh, won't you invite the prisoner in the next cell?"</p>
<p>"Yes!  Yes!  Let us knock on the wall now.  The jailer won't
hear."</p>
<p>Sara went to the wall.  Through it she could hear poor Becky
crying more softly.  She knocked four times.</p>
<p>"That means, 'Come to me through the secret passage under the
wall,' she explained.  'I have something to communicate.'"</p>
<p>Five quick knocks answered her.</p>
<p>"She is coming," she said.</p>
<p>Almost immediately the door of the attic opened and Becky
appeared.  Her eyes were red and her cap was sliding off, and when she
caught sight of Ermengarde she began to rub her face nervously with her
apron.</p>
<p>"Don't mind me a bit, Becky!" cried Ermengarde.</p>

<pb n="181"/>
<p>"Miss Ermengarde has asked you to come in," said Sara, "because
she is going to bring a box of good things up here to us."</p>
<p>Becky's cap almost fell off entirely, she broke in with such
excitement.</p>
<p>"To eat, miss?" she said.  "Things that's good to eat?"</p>
<p>"Yes," answered Sara, "and we are going to pretend a
party."</p>
<p>"And you shall have as much as you want to eat," put in
Ermengarde.  "I'll go this minute!"</p>
<p>She was in such haste that as she tiptoed out of the attic she
dropped her red shawl and did not know it had fallen.  No one saw it for
a minute or so.  Becky was too much overpowered by the good luck
which had befallen her.</p>
<p>"Oh, miss! oh, miss!" she gasped; "I know it was you that asked
her to let me come.  It&mdash;it makes me cry to think of it."  And she went
to Sara's side and stood and looked at her worshipingly.</p>
<p>But in Sara's hungry eyes the old light had begun to glow and
transform her world for her.  Here in the attic&mdash;with the cold night
outside&mdash;with the afternoon in the sloppy streets barely passed&mdash;with the
memory of the awful unfed look in the beggar child's eyes not yet
faded&mdash;this simple, cheerful thing had happened like a thing of
magic.</p>
<p>She caught her breath.</p>
<p>"Somehow, something always happens," she cried, "just before
things get to the very worst.  It is as if the Magic did it.  If I could only
just remember that always.  The worst thing never quite comes."</p>
<p>She gave Becky a little cheerful shake.</p>
<p>"No, no!  You mustn't cry!" she said.  "We must make haste and
set the table."</p>

<pb n="182"/>
<p>"Set the table, miss?" said Becky, gazing round the room.
"What'll we set it with?"</p>
<p>Sara looked round the attic, too.</p>
<p>"There doesn't seem to be much," she answered, half
laughing.</p>
<p>That moment she saw something and pounced upon it.  It was
Ermengarde's red shawl which lay upon the floor.</p>
<p>"Here's the shawl," she cried.  "I know she won't mind it.  It will
make such a nice red tablecloth."</p>
<p>They pulled the old table forward, and threw the shawl over it.
Red is a wonderfully kind and comfortable color.  It began to make the
room look furnished directly.</p>
<p>"How nice a red rug would look on the floor!" exclaimed Sara.
"We must pretend there is one!"</p>
<p>Her eye swept the bare boards with a swift glance of admiration.
The rug was laid down already.</p>
<p>"How soft and thick it is!" she said, with the little laugh which
Becky knew the meaning of; and she raised and set her foot down again
delicately, as if she felt something under lt.</p>
<p>"Yes, miss," answered Becky, watching her with serious rapture.
She was always quite serious.</p>
<p>"What next, now?" said Sara, and she stood still and put her hands
over her eyes.  "Something will come if I think and wait a little"&mdash;in a
soft, expectant voice.  "The Magic will tell me."</p>
<p>One of her favorite fancies was that on "the outside," as she called
it, thoughts were waiting for people to call them.  Becky had seen her
stand and wait many a time before, and knew that in a few seconds she
would uncover an enlightened, laughing face.</p>
<p>In a moment she did.</p>
<p>"There!" she cried.  "It has come!  I know now!  I must

<pb n="183"/> look among the things in the old trunk I had when I was
a princess."</p>
<p>She flew to its corner and kneeled down.  It had not been put in
the attic for her benefit, but because there was no room for it elsewhere.
Nothing had been left in it but rubbish.  But she knew she should find
something.  The Magic always arranged that kind of thing in one way or
another.</p>
<p>In a corner lay a package so insignificant-looking that it had been
overlooked, and when she herself had found it she had kept it as a relic.
It contained a dozen small white handkerchiefs.  She seized them joyfully
and ran to the table.  She began to arrange them upon the red
table-cover, patting and coaxing them into shape with the narrow lace
edge curling outward, her Magic working its spells for her as she did
it.</p>
<p>"These are the plates," she said.  "They are golden plates.  These
are the richly embroidered napkins.  Nuns worked them in convents in
Spain."</p>
<p>"Did they, miss?" breathed Becky, her very soul uplifted by the
information.</p>
<p>"You must pretend it," said Sara.  "If you pretend it enough, you
will see them."</p>
<p>"Yes, miss," said Becky; and as Sara returned to the trunk she
devoted herself to the effort of accomplishing an end so much to be
desired.</p>
<p>Sara turned suddenly to find her standing by the table, looking
very queer indeed.  She had shut her eyes, and was twisting her face in
strange convulsive contortions, her hands hanging stiffly clenched at her
sides.  She looked as if she was trying to lift some enormous
weight.</p>
<p>"What is the matter, Becky?" Sara cried.  "What are you
doing?"</p>
<p>Becky opened her eyes with a start.  </p>

<pb n="184"/>
<p>I was a-'pretendin',' miss," she answered a little sheepishly; "I
was tryin' to see it like you do.  I almost did," with a hopeful grin.
"But it takes a lot o' stren'th."</p>
<p>"Perhaps it does if you are not used to it," said Sara, with friendly
sympathy; "but you don't know how easy it is when you've done it
often.  I wouldn't try so hard just at first.  It will come to you after a
while.  I'll just tell you what things are.  Look at these."</p>
<p>She held an old summer hat in her hand which she had fished out
of the bottom of the trunk.  There was a wreath of flowers on it.  She
pulled the wreath off.</p>
<p>"These are garlands for the feast," she said grandly.  "They fill all
the air with perfume.  There's a mug on the wash-stand, Becky.
Oh&mdash;and bring the soap dish for a centerpiece."</p>
<p>Becky handed them to her reverently.</p>
<p>"What are they now, miss?" she inquired.  "You'd think they was
made of crockery&mdash;but I know they ain't."</p>
<p>"This is a carven flagon," said Sara, arranging tendrils of the
wreath about the mug.  "And this"&mdash;bending tenderly over the soap dish
and heaping it with roses&mdash;"is purest alabaster encrusted with
gems."</p>
<p>She touched the things gently, a happy smile hovering about her
lips which made her look as if she were a creature in a dream.</p>
<p>"My, ain't it lovely!" whispered Becky.</p>
<p>"If we just had something for bonbon dishes," Sara murmured.
"There!"&mdash;darting to the trunk again.  "I remember I saw something this
minute."</p>
<p>It was only a bundle of wool wrapped in red and white tissue
paper, but the tissue paper was soon twisted into the form of little
dishes, and was combined with the remaining flowers to ornament the
candlestick which was to light the

<pb n="185"/> feast.  Only the Magic could have made it more than an
old table covered with a red shawl and set with rubbish from a
long-unopened trunk.  But Sara drew back and gazed at it, seeing
wonders; and Becky, after staring in delight, spoke with bated
breath.</p>
<p>"This 'ere," she suggested, with a glance round the attic&mdash;"is it the
Bastille now&mdash;or has it turned into somethin' different?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, yes!" said Sara.  "Quite different.  It is a banquet
hall!"</p>
<p>"My eye, miss!" ejaculated Becky.  "A blanket 'all!" and she
turned to view the splendors about her with awed bewilderment.</p>
<p>"A banquet hall," said Sara.  "A vast chamber where feasts are
given.  It has a vaulted roof, and a minstrels' gallery, and a huge
chimney filled with blazing oaken logs, and it is brilliant with waxen
tapers twinkling on every side."</p>
<p>"My eye, Miss Sara!" gasped Becky again.</p>
<p>Then the door opened, and Ermengarde came in, rather staggering
under the weight of her hamper.  She started back with an exclamation
of joy.  To enter from the chill darkness outside, and find one's self
confronted by a totally unanticipated festal board, draped with red,
adorned with white napery, and wreathed with flowers, was to feel that
the preparations were brilliant indeed.</p>
<p>"Oh, Sara!" she cried out.  "You are the cleverest girl I ever
saw!"</p>
<p>"Isn't it nice?" said Sara.  "They are things out of my old trunk.  I
asked my Magic, and it told me to go and look."</p>
<p>"But oh, miss," cried Becky, "wait till she's told you what they
are!  They ain't just&mdash;oh, miss, please tell her," appealing to Sara.</p>

<p>So Sara told her, and because her Magic helped her she

<pb n="186"/> made her almost see it all: the golden platters&mdash;the
vaulted spaces&mdash;the blazing logs&mdash;the twinkling waxen tapers.  As the
things were taken out of the hamper&mdash;the frosted cakes&mdash;the fruits&mdash;the
bonbons and the wine&mdash;the feast became a splendid thing.</p>
<p>"It's like a real party!" cried Ermengarde.</p>
<p>"It's like a queen's table," sighed Becky.</p>
<p>Then Ermengarde had a sudden brilliant thought.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you what, Sara," she said.  "Pretend you are a princess
now and this is a royal feast."</p>
<p>"But it's your feast," said Sara; "you must be the princess, and we
will be your maids of honor."</p>
<p>"Oh, I can't," said Ermengarde.  "I'm too fat, and I don't know
how.  You be her."</p>
<p>"Well, if you want me to," said Sara.</p>
<p>But suddenly she thought of something else and ran to the rusty
grate.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of paper and rubbish stuffed in here!" she
exclaimed.  "If we light it, there will be a bright blaze for a few
minutes, and we shall feel as if it was a real fire." She struck a match
and lighted it up with a great specious glow which illuminated the
room.</p>
<p>"By the time it stops blazing," Sara said, "we shall forget about its
not being real."</p>
<p>She stood in the dancing glow and smiled.</p>
<p>"Doesn't it look real?" she said.  "Now we will begin the
party."</p>
<p>She led the way to the table.  She waved her hand graciously to
Ermengarde and Becky.  She was in the midst of her dream.</p>
<p>"Advance, fair damsels," she said in her happy dream-voice, "and
be seated at the banquet table.  My noble father, the king, who is absent
on a long journey, has commanded

<pb n="187"/> me to feast you."  She turned her head slightly toward
the corner of the room.  "What, ho, there, minstrels!  Strike up with
your viols and bassoons.  Princesses," she explained rapidly to
Ermengarde and Becky, "always had minstrels to play at their feasts.
Pretend there is a minstrel gallery up there in the corner.  Now we will
begin."</p>
<p>They had barely had time to take their pieces of cake into their
hands&mdash;not one of them had time to do more, when&mdash;they all three sprang
to their feet and turned pale faces toward the
door&mdash;listening&mdash;listening.</p>
<p>Someone was coming up the stairs.  There was no mistake about
it.  Each of them recognized the angry, mounting tread and knew that
the end of all things had come.</p>
<p>"It's&mdash;the missus!" choked Becky, and dropped her piece of cake
upon the floor.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Sara, her eyes growing shocked and large in her small
white face.  "Miss Minchin has found us out."</p>
<p>Miss Minchin struck the door open with a blow of her hand.  She
was pale herself, but it was with rage.  She looked from the frightened
faces to the banquet table, and from the banquet table to the last flicker
of the burnt paper in the grate.</p>
<p>"I have been suspecting something of this sort," she exclaimed;
"but I did not dream of such audacity.  Lavinia was telling the
truth."</p>
<p>So they knew that it was Lavinia who had somehow guessed their
secret and had betrayed them.  Miss Minchin strode over to Becky and
boxed her ears for a second time.</p>
<p>"You impudent creature!" she said.  "You leave the house in the
morning!"</p>
<p>Sara stood quite still, her eyes growing larger, her face paler.
Ermengarde burst into tears.</p>

<pb n="188"/>
<pb n="189"/>
<p>"Oh, don't send her away," she sobbed.  "My aunt sent me the
hamper.  We're&mdash;only&mdash;having a party."</p>
<p>"So I see," said Miss Minchin, witheringly.  "With the Princess
Sara at the head of the table."  She turned fiercely on Sara.  "It is your
doing, I know," she cried.  "Ermengarde would never have thought of
such a thing.  You decorated the table, I suppose&mdash;with this rubbish."
She stamped her foot at Becky.  "Go to your attic!" she commanded, and
Becky stole away, her face hidden in her apron, her shoulders
shaking.</p>
<p>Then it was Sara's turn again.</p>
<p>"I will attend to you tomorrow.  You shall have neither breakfast,
dinner, nor supper!"</p>
<p>"I have not had either dinner or supper today, Miss Minchin," said
Sara, rather faintly.</p>
<p>"Then all the better.  You will have something to remember.
Don't stand there.  Put those things into the hamper again."</p>
<p>She began to sweep them off the table into the hamper herself, and
caught sight of Ermengarde's new books.</p>
<p>"And you"&mdash;to Ermengarde&mdash;"have brought your beautiful new
books into this dirty attic.  Take them up and go back to bed.  You will
stay there all day tomorrow, and I shall write to your papa.  What would
he say if he knew where you are tonight?"</p>
<p>Something she saw in Sara's grave, fixed gaze at this moment
made her turn on her fiercely.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking of?" she demanded.  "Why do you look at
me like that?"</p>
<p>"I was wondering," answered Sara, as she had answered that
notable day in the schoolroom.</p>
<p>"What were you wondering?"</p>
<p>It was very like the scene in the schoolroom.  There was

<pb n="190"/>
no pertness in Sara's manner.  It was only sad and quiet.</p>
<p>"I was wondering," she said in a low voice, "what my papa would
say if he knew where I am tonight."</p>
<p>Miss Minchin was infuriated just as she had been before and her
anger expressed itself, as before, in an intemperate fashion.  She flew at
her and shook her.</p>
<p>"You insolent, unmanageable child!" she cried.  "How dare you!
How dare you!"</p>
<p>She picked up the books, swept the rest of the feast back into the
hamper in a jumbled heap, thrust it into Ermengarde's arms, and pushed
her before her toward the door.</p>
<p>"I will leave you to wonder," she said.  "Go to bed this instant."
And she shut the door behind herself and poor stumbling Ermengarde,
and left Sara standing quite alone.</p>
<p>The dream was quite at an end.  The last spark had died out of the
paper in the grate and left only black tinder; the table was left bare, the
golden plates and richly embroidered napkins, and the garlands were
transformed again into old handkerchiefs, scraps of red and white paper,
and discarded artificial flowers all scattered on the floor; the minstrels in
the minstrel gallery had stolen away, and the viols and bassoons were
still.  Emily was sitting with her back against the wall, staring very hard.
Sara saw her, and went and picked her up with trembling hands.</p>
<p>"There isn't any banquet left, Emily," she said.  "And there isn't
any princess.  There is nothing left but the prisoners in the Bastille."
And she sat down and hid her face.</p>
<p>What would have happened if she had not hidden it just then, and
if she had chanced to look up at the skylight at the wrong moment, I do
not know&mdash;perhaps the end of this chapter might have been quite
different&mdash;because if she had glanced at the skylight she would certainly
have been startled by what she would have seen.  She would have seen
exactly

<pb n="191"/> the same face pressed against the glass and peering in at
her as it had peered in earlier in the evening when she had been talking
to Ermengarde.</p>
<p>But she did not look up.  She sat with her little black head in her
arms for some time.  She always sat like that when she was trying to
bear something in silence.  Then she got up and went slowly to the
bed.</p>
<p>"I can't pretend anything else&mdash;while I am awake," she said.
"There wouldn't be any use in trying.  If I go to sleep, perhaps a dream
will come and pretend for me."</p>
<p>She suddenly felt so tired&mdash;perhaps through want of food&mdash;that she
sat down on the edge of the bed quite weakly.</p>
<p>"Suppose there was a bright fire in the grate, with lots of little
dancing flames," she murmured.  "Suppose there was a comfortable
chair before it&mdash;and suppose there was a small table near, with a little
hot&mdash;hot supper on it.  And suppose"&mdash;as she drew the thin coverings
over her&mdash;"suppose this was a beautiful soft bed, with fleecy blankets and
large downy pillows.  Suppose&mdash;suppose&mdash;"  And her very weariness was
good to her, for her eyes closed and she fell fast asleep.</p>
<p>She did not know how long she slept.  But she had been tired
enough to sleep deeply and profoundly&mdash;too deeply and soundly to be
disturbed by anything, even by the squeaks and scamperings of
Melchisedec's entire family, if all his sons and daughters had chosen to
come out of their hole to fight and tumble and play.</p>
<p>When she awakened it was rather suddenly, and she did not know
that any particular thing had called her out of her sleep.  The truth was,
however, that it was a sound which had called her back&mdash;a real
sound&mdash;the click of the skylight as it fell in closing after a lithe white
figure which slipped

<pb n="192"/> through it and crouched down close by upon the slates
of the roof&mdash;just near enough to see what happened in the attic, but not
near enough to be seen.</p>
<p>At first she did not open her eyes.  She felt too sleepy
and&mdash;curiously enough&mdash;too warm and comfortable.  She was so warm
and comfortable, indeed, that she did not believe she was really awake.
She never was as warm and cozy as this except in some lovely
vision.</p>
<p>"What a nice dream!" she murmured.  "I feel quite warm.
I&mdash;don't&mdash;want&mdash;to&mdash;wake&mdash;up."</p>
<p>Of course it was a dream.  She felt as if warm, delightful
bedclothes were heaped upon her.  She could actually feel blankets, and
when she put out her hand it touched something exactly like a
satin-covered eider-down quilt.  She must not awaken from this
delight&mdash;she must be quite still and make it last.</p>
<p>But she could not&mdash;even though she kept her eyes closed tightly,
she could not.  Something was forcing her to awaken&mdash;something in the
room.  It was a sense of light, and a sound&mdash;the sound of a crackling,
roaring little fire.</p>
<p>"Oh, I am awakening," she said mournfully.  "I can't help it&mdash;I
can't."</p>
<p>Her eyes opened in spite of herself.  And then she actually
smiled&mdash;for what she saw she had never seen in the attic before, and
knew she never should see.</p>
<p>"Oh, I haven't awakened," she whispered, daring to rise on her
elbow and look all about her.  "I am dreaming yet." She knew it must be
a dream, for if she were awake such things could not&mdash;could not
be.</p>
<p>Do you wonder that she felt sure she had not come back to earth?
This is what she saw.  In the grate there was a glowing, blazing fire; on
the hob was a little brass kettle hissing and boiling; spread upon the floor
was a thick, warm

<pb n="193"/> crimson rug; before the fire a folding-chair, unfolded,
and with cushions on it; by the chair a small folding-table, unfolded,
covered with a white cloth, and upon it spread small covered dishes, a
cup, a saucer, a teapot; on the bed were new warm coverings and a
satin-covered down quilt; at the foot a curious wadded silk robe, a pair
of quilted slippers, and some books.  The room of her dream seemed
changed into fairyland&mdash;and it was flooded with warm light, for a bright
lamp stood on the table covered with a rosy shade.</p>
<p>She sat up, resting on her elbow, and her breathing came short and
fast.</p>
<p>"It does not&mdash;melt away," she panted.  "Oh, I never had such a
dream before."  She scarcely dared to stir; but at last she pushed the
bedclothes aside, and put her feet on the floor with a rapturous
smile.</p>
<p>"I am dreaming&mdash;I am getting out of bed," she heard her own voice
say; and then, as she stood up in the midst of it all, turning slowly from
side to side&mdash;"I am dreaming it stays&mdash;real!  I'm dreaming it feels real.
It's bewitched&mdash;or I'm bewitched.  I only think I see it all."  Her words
began to hurry themselves.  "If I can only keep on thinking it," she
cried, "I don't care!  I don't care!"</p>
<p>She stood panting a moment longer, and then cried out
again.</p>
<p>"Oh, it isn't true!" she said.  "It can't be true!  But oh, how true it
seems!"</p>
<p>The blazing fire drew her to it, and she knelt down and held out
her hands close to it&mdash;so close that the heat made her start back.</p>
<p>"A fire I only dreamed wouldn't be hot," she cried.</p>
<p>She sprang up, touched the table, the dishes, the rug; she went to
the bed and touched the blankets.  She took up

<pb n="194"/> the soft wadded dressing-gown, and suddenly clutched it
to her breast and held it to her cheek.</p>
<p>"It's warm.  It's soft!" she almost sobbed.  "It's real.  It must
be!"</p>
<p>She threw it over her shoulders, and put her feet into the
slippers.</p>
<p>"They are real, too.  It's all real!" she cried.  "I am not&mdash;I am not
dreaming!"</p>
<p>She almost staggered to the books and opened the one which lay
upon the top.  Something was written on the flyleaf&mdash;just a few words,
and they were these:</p>
<p>"To the little girl in the attic.  From a friend."</p>
<p>When she saw that&mdash;wasn't it a strange thing for her to do&mdash;she put
her face down upon the page and burst into tears.</p>
<p>"I don't know who it is," she said; "but somebody cares for me a
little.  I have a friend."</p>
<p>She took her candle and stole out of her own room and into
Becky's, and stood by her bedside.</p>
<p>"Becky, Becky!" she whispered as loudly as she dared.  "Wake
up!"</p>
<p>When Becky wakened, and she sat upright staring aghast, her face
still smudged with traces of tears, beside her stood a little figure in a
luxurious wadded robe of crimson silk.  The face she saw was a shining,
wonderful thing.  The Princess Sara&mdash;as she remembered her&mdash;stood at
her very bedside, holding a candle in her hand.</p>
<p>"Come," she said.  "Oh, Becky, come!"</p>
<p>Becky was too frightened to speak.  She simply got up and
followed her, with her mouth and eyes open, and without a word.</p>

<p>And when they crossed the threshold, Sara shut the door gently
and drew her into the warm, glowing midst of things

<pb n="195"/> which made her brain reel and her hungry senses faint.
  "It's true!  It's true!" she cried.  "I've touched them all. They are as
real as we are.  The Magic has come and done it, Becky, while we were
asleep&mdash;the Magic that won't let those worst things ever quite happen."

<head>The Visitor</head>
<p>Imagine, if you can, what the rest of the evening was like.  How
they crouched by the fire which blazed and leaped and made so much of
itself in the little grate.  How they removed the covers of the dishes, and
found rich, hot, savory soup, which was a meal in itself, and sandwiches
and toast and muffins enough for both of them.  The mug from the
washstand was used as Becky's tea cup, and the tea was so delicious that
it was not necessary to pretend that it was anything but tea.  They were
warm and full-fed and happy, and it was just like Sara that, having found
her strange good fortune real, she should give herself up to the
enjoyment of it to the utmost.  She had lived such a life of imaginings
that she was quite equal to accepting any wonderful thing that

<pb n="197"/> happened, and almost to cease, in a short time, to find
it bewildering.</p>
<p>"I don't know anyone in the world who could have done it," she
said; "but there has been someone.  And here we are sitting by their
fire&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;it's true!  And whoever it is&mdash;wherever they are&mdash;I have a
friend, Becky&mdash;someone is my friend."</p>
<p>It cannot be denied that as they sat before the blazing fire, and ate
the nourishing, comfortable food, they felt a kind of rapturous awe, and
looked into each other's eyes with something like doubt.</p>
<p>"Do you think," Becky faltered once, in a whisper, "do you think
it could melt away, miss?  Hadn't we better be quick?"  And she hastily
crammed her sandwich into her mouth.  If it was only a dream, kitchen
manners would be overlooked.</p>
<p>"No, it won't melt away," said Sara.  "I am eating this muffin,
and I can taste it.  You never really eat things in dreams.  You only
think you are going to eat them.  Besides, I keep giving myself pinches;
and I touched a hot piece of coal just now, on purpose."</p>
<p>The sleepy comfort which at length almost overpowered them was
a heavenly thing.  It was the drowsiness of happy, well-fed childhood,
and they sat in the fire glow and luxuriated in it until Sara found herself
turning to look at her transformed bed.</p>
<p>There were even blankets enough to share with Becky.  The
narrow couch in the next attic was more comfortable that night than its
occupant had ever dreamed that it could be.</p>
<p>As she went out of the room, Becky turned upon the threshold and
looked about her with devouring eyes.</p>
<p>"If it ain't here in the mornin', miss," she said, "it's

<pb n="198"/> been here tonight, anyways, an' I shan't never forget
it." She looked at each particular thing, as if to commit it to memory.
"The fire was there," pointing with her finger, "an' the table was before
it; an' the lamp was there, an' the light looked rosy red; an' there was a
satin cover on your bed, an' a warm rug on the floor, an' everythin'
looked beautiful; an'"&mdash;she paused a second, and laid her hand on her
stomach tenderly&mdash;"there was soup an' sandwiches an' muffins&mdash;there
was."  And, with this conviction a reality at least, she went away.</p>

<p>Through the mysterious agency which works in schools and among
servants, it was quite well known in the morning that Sara Crewe was in
horrible disgrace, that Ermengarde was under punishment, and that
Becky would have been packed out of the house before breakfast, but
that a scullery maid could not be dispensed with at once.  The servants
knew that she was allowed to stay because Miss Minchin could not easily
find another creature helpless and humble enough to work like a bounden
slave for so few shillings a week.  The elder girls in the schoolroom
knew that if Miss Minchin did not send Sara away it was for practical
reasons of her own.</p>
<p>"She's growing so fast and learning such a lot, somehow," said
Jessie to Lavinia, "that she will be given classes soon, and Miss Minchin
knows she will have to work for nothing.  It was rather nasty of you,
Lavvy, to tell about her having fun in the garret.  How did you find it
out?"</p>
<p>"I got it out of Lottie.  She's such a baby she didn't know she was
telling me.  There was nothing nasty at all in speaking to Miss Minchin.
I felt it my duty"&mdash;priggishly.  "She was being deceitful.  And it's
ridiculous that she should look so grand, and be made so much of, in her
rags and tatters!"</p>
<p>"What were they doing when Miss Minchin caught them?"  </p>


<pb n="199"/>
<p>"Pretending some silly thing.  Ermengarde had taken up her
hamper to share with Sara and Becky.  She never invites us to share
things.  Not that I care, but it's rather vulgar of her to share with servant
girls in attics.  I wonder Miss Minchin didn't turn Sara out&mdash;even if she
does want her for a teacher."</p>
<p>"If she was turned out where would she go?" inquired Jessie, a
trifle anxiously.</p>
<p>"How do I know?" snapped Lavinia.  "She'll look rather queer
when she comes into the schoolroom this morning, I should think&mdash;after
what's happened.  She had no dinner yesterday, and she's not to have
any today."</p>
<p>Jessie was not as ill-natured as she was silly.  She picked up her
book with a little jerk.</p>
<p>"Well, I think it's horrid," she said.  "They've no right to starve
her to death."</p>
<p>When Sara went into the kitchen that morning the cook looked
askance at her, and so did the housemaids; but she passed them
hurriedly.  She had, in fact, overslept herself a little, and as Becky had
done the same, neither had had time to see the other, and each had come
downstairs in haste.</p>
<p>Sara went into the scullery.  Becky was violently scrubbing a
kettle, and was actually gurgling a little song in her throat.  She looked
up with a wildly elated face.</p>
<p>"It was there when I wakened, miss&mdash;the blanket," she whispered
excitedly.  "It was as real as it was last night."</p>
<p>"So was mine," said Sara.  "It is all there now&mdash;all of it.  While I
was dressing I ate some of the cold things we left."</p>
<p>"Oh, laws!  Oh, laws!" Becky uttered the exclamation in a sort of
rapturous groan, and ducked her head over her kettle just in time, as the
cook came in from the kitchen.</p>
<p>Miss Minchin had expected to see in Sara, when she appeared in
the schoolroom, very much what Lavinia had

<pb n="200"/> expected to see.  Sara had always been an annoying
puzzle to her, because severity never made her cry or look frightened.
When she was scolded she stood still and listened politely with a grave
face; when she was punished she performed her extra tasks or went
without her meals, making no complaint or outward sign of rebellion.
The very fact that she never made an impudent answer seemed to Miss
Minchin a kind of impudence in itself.  But after yesterday's deprivation
of meals, the violent scene of last night, the prospect of hunger today,
she must surely have broken down.  It would be strange indeed if she
did not come downstairs with pale cheeks and red eyes and an unhappy,
humbled face.</p>
<p>Miss Minchin saw her for the first time when she entered the
schoolroom to hear the little French class recite its lessons and
superintend its exercises.  And she came in with a springing step, color
in her cheeks, and a smile hovering about the corners of her mouth.  It
was the most astonishing thing Miss Minchin had ever known.  It gave
her quite a shock.  What was the child made of?  What could such a
thing mean?  She called her at once to her desk.</p>
<p>"You do not look as if you realize that you are in disgrace," she
said.  "Are you absolutely hardened?"</p>
<p>The truth is that when one is still a child&mdash;or even if one is grown
up&mdash;and has been well fed, and has slept long and softly and warm; when
one has gone to sleep in the midst of a fairy story, and has wakened to
find it real, one cannot be unhappy or even look as if one were; and one
could not, if one tried, keep a glow of joy out of one's eyes.  Miss
Minchin was almost struck dumb by the look of Sara's eyes when she
made her perfectly respectful answer.</p>
<p>"I beg your pardon, Miss Minchin," she said; "I know that I am in
disgrace."</p>
<p>"Be good enough not to forget it and look as if you had

<pb n="201"/> come into a fortune.  It is an impertinence.  And
remember you are to have no food today."</p>
<p>"Yes, Miss Minchin," Sara answered; but as she turned away her
heart leaped with the memory of what yesterday had been.  "If the
Magic had not saved me just in time," she thought, "how horrible it
would have been!"</p>
<p>"She can't be very hungry," whispered Lavinia.  "Just look at her.
Perhaps she is pretending she has had a good breakfast"&mdash;with a spiteful
laugh.</p>
<p>"She's different from other people," said Jessie, watching Sara
with her class.  "Sometimes I'm a bit frightened of her."</p>
<p>"Ridiculous thing!" ejaculated Lavinia.</p>
<p>All through the day the light was in Sara's face, and the color in
her cheek.  The servants cast puzzled glances at her, and whispered to
each other, and Miss Amelia's small blue eyes wore an expression of
bewilderment.  What such an audacious look of well-being, under august
displeasure could mean she could not understand.  It was, however, just
like Sara's singular obstinate way.  She was probably determined to
brave the matter out.</p>
<p>One thing Sara had resolved upon, as she thought things over.
The wonders which had happened must be kept a secret, if such a thing
were possible.  If Miss Minchin should choose to mount to the attic
again, of course all would be discovered.  But it did not seem likely that
she would do so for some time at least, unless she was led by suspicion.
Ermengarde and Lottie would be watched with such strictness that they
would not dare to steal out of their beds again.  Ermengarde could be
told the story and trusted to keep it secret.  If Lottie made any
discoveries, she could be bound to secrecy also.  Perhaps the Magic
itself would help to hide its own marvels.</p>

<pb n="202"/>
<p>"But whatever happens," Sara kept saying to herself all
day&mdash;"whatever happens, somewhere in the world there is a heavenly
kind person who is my friend&mdash;my friend.  If I never know who it is&mdash;if I
never can even thank him&mdash;I shall never feel quite so lonely.  Oh, the
Magic was good to me!"</p>
<p>If it was possible for weather to be worse than it had been the day
before, it was worse this day&mdash;wetter, muddier, colder.  There were
more errands to be done, the cook was more irritable, and, knowing that
Sara was in disgrace, she was more savage.  But what does anything
matter when one's Magic has just proved itself one's friend.  Sara's
supper of the night before had given her strength, she knew that she
should sleep well and warmly, and, even though she had naturally begun
to be hungry again before evening, she felt that she could bear it until
breakfast-time on the following day, when her meals would surely be
given to her again.  It was quite late when she was at last allowed to go
upstairs.  She had been told to go into the schoolroom and study until ten
o'clock, and she had become interested in her work, and remained over
her books later.</p>
<p>When she reached the top flight of stairs and stood before the attic
door, it must be confessed that her heart beat rather fast.</p>
<p>"Of course it might all have been taken away," she whispered,
trying to be brave.  "It might only have been lent to me for just that one
awful night.  But it was lent to me&mdash;I had it.  It was real."</p>
<p>She pushed the door open and went in.  Once inside, she gasped
slightly, shut the door, and stood with her back against it looking from
side to side.</p>
<p>The Magic had been there again.  It actually had, and it had done
even more than before.  The fire was blazing, in

<pb n="203"/> lovely leaping flames, more merrily than ever.  A
number of new things had been brought into the attic which so altered
the look of it that if she had not been past doubting she would have
rubbed her eyes.  Upon the low table another supper stood&mdash;this time
with cups and plates for Becky as well as herself; a piece of bright,
heavy, strange embroidery covered the battered mantel, and on it some
ornaments had been placed.  All the bare, ugly things which could be
covered with draperies had been concealed and made to look quite
pretty.  Some odd materials of rich colors had been fastened against the
wall with fine, sharp tacks&mdash;so sharp that they could be pressed into the
wood and plaster without hammering.  Some brilliant fans were pinned
up, and there were several large cushions, big and substantial enough to
use as seats.  A wooden box was covered with a rug, and some cushions
lay on it, so that it wore quite the air of a sofa.</p>
<p>Sara slowly moved away from the door and simply sat down and
looked and looked again.</p>
<p>"It is exactly like something fairy come true," she said.  "There
isn't the least difference.  I feel as if I might wish for
anything&mdash;diamonds or bags of gold&mdash;and they would appear!  That
wouldn't be any stranger than this.  Is this my garret?  Am I the same
cold, ragged, damp Sara?  And to think I used to pretend and pretend
and wish there were fairies! The one thing I always wanted was to see a
fairy story come true.  I am living in a fairy story.  I feel as if I might
be a fairy myself, and able to turn things into anything else."</p>
<p>She rose and knocked upon the wall for the prisoner in the next
cell, and the prisoner came.</p>
<p>When she entered she almost dropped in a heap upon the floor.
For a few seconds she quite lost her breath.</p>
<p>"Oh, laws!" she gasped.  "Oh, laws, miss!"</p>
<p>"You see," said Sara.  </p>

<pb n="204"/>
<p>On this night Becky sat on a cushion upon the hearth rug and had a
cup and saucer of her own.</p>
<p>When Sara went to bed she found that she had a new thick
mattress and big downy pillows.  Her old mattress and pillow had been
removed to Becky's bedstead, and, consequently, with these additions
Becky had been supplied with unheard-of comfort.</p>
<p>"Where does it all come from?" Becky broke forth once.  "Laws,
who does it, miss?"</p>
<p>"Don't let us even ask," said Sara.  "If it were not that I want to
say, 'Oh, thank you,' I would rather not know.  It makes it more
beautiful."</p>
<p>From that time life became more wonderful day by day.  The fairy
story continued.  Almost every day something new was done.  Some new
comfort or ornament appeared each time Sara opened the door at night,
until in a short time the attic was a beautiful little room full of all sorts
of odd and luxurious things.  The ugly walls were gradually entirely
covered with pictures and draperies, ingenious pieces of folding furniture
appeared, a bookshelf was hung up and filled with books, new comforts
and conveniences appeared one by one, until there seemed nothing left to
be desired.  When Sara went downstairs in the morning, the remains of
the supper were on the table; and when she returned to the attic in the
evening, the magician had removed them and left another nice little
meal.  Miss Minchin was as harsh and insulting as ever, Miss Amelia as
peevish, and the servants were as vulgar and rude.  Sara was sent on
errands in all weathers, and scolded and driven hither and thither; she
was scarcely allowed to speak to Ermengarde and Lottie; Lavinia sneered
at the increasing shabbiness of her clothes; and the other girls stared
curiously at her when she appeared in the schoolroom.  But what did it
all matter while she was living in this wonderful mysterious

<pb n="205"/>
<pb n="206"/> story?  It was more romantic and delightful than
anything she had ever invented to comfort her starved young soul and
save herself from despair.  Sometimes, when she was scolded, she could
scarcely keep from smiling.</p>
<p>"If you only knew!" she was saying to herself.  "If you only
knew!"</p>
<p>The comfort and happiness she enjoyed were making her stronger,
and she had them always to look forward to.  If she came home from her
errands wet and tired and hungry, she knew she would soon be warm
and well fed after she had climbed the stairs.  During the hardest day she
could occupy herself blissfully by thinking of what she should see when
she opened the attic door, and wondering what new delight had been
prepared for her.  In a very short time she began to look less thin.
Color came into her cheeks, and her eyes did not seem so much too big
for her face.</p>
<p>"Sara Crewe looks wonderfully well," Miss Minchin remarked
disapprovingly to her sister.</p>
<p>"Yes," answered poor, silly Miss Amelia.  "She is absolutely
fattening.  She was beginning to look like a little starved crow."</p>
<p>"Starved!" exclaimed Miss Minchin, angrily.  "There was no
reason why she should look starved.  She always had plenty to
eat!"</p>
<p>"Of&mdash;of course," agreed Miss Amelia, humbly, alarmed to find that
she had, as usual, said the wrong thing.</p>
<p>"There is something very disagreeable in seeing that sort of thing
in a child of her age," said Miss Minchin, with haughty
vagueness.</p>
<p>"What&mdash;sort of thing?" Miss Amelia ventured.</p>
<p>"It might almost be called defiance," answered Miss Minchin,
feeling annoyed because she knew the thing she resented was nothing
like defiance, and she did not know what other unpleasant term to use.
"The spirit and will of

<pb n="207"/> any other child would have been entirely humbled and
broken by&mdash;by the changes she has had to submit to.  But, upon my
word, she seems as little subdued as if&mdash;as if she were a princess."</p>

<p>"Do you remember," put in the unwise Miss Amelia, "what she
said to you that day in the schoolroom about what you would do if you
found out that she was&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, I don't," said Miss Minchin.  "Don't talk nonsense."  But
she remembered very clearly indeed.</p>
<p>Very naturally, even Becky was beginning to look plumper and
less frightened.  She could not help it.  She had her share in the secret
fairy story, too.  She had two mattresses, two pillows, plenty of
bed-covering, and every night a hot supper and a seat on the cushions by
the fire.  The Bastille had melted away, the prisoners no longer existed.
Two comforted children sat in the midst of delights.  Sometimes Sara
read aloud from her books, sometimes she learned her own lessons,
sometimes she sat and looked into the fire and tried to imagine who her
friend could be, and wished she could say to him some of the things in
her heart.</p>
<p>Then it came about that another wonderful thing happened.  A man
came to the door and left several parcels.  All were addressed in large
letters, "To the Little Girl in the right-hand attic."</p>
<p>Sara herself was sent to open the door and take them in.  She laid
the two largest parcels on the hall table, and was looking at the address,
when Miss Minchin came down the stairs and saw her.</p>
<p>"Take the things to the young lady to whom they belong," she said
severely.  "Don't stand there staring at them.</p>
<p>"They belong to me," answered Sara, quietly.</p>
<p>"To you?" exclaimed Miss Minchin.  "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I don't know where they come from," said Sara, "but

<pb n="208"/> they are addressed to me.  I sleep in the right-hand
attic. Becky has the other one."</p>
<p>Miss Minchin came to her side and looked at the parcels with an
excited expression.</p>
<p>"What is in them?" she demanded.</p>
<p>"I don't know," replied Sara.</p>
<p>"Open them," she ordered.</p>
<p>Sara did as she was told.  When the packages were unfolded Miss
Minchin's countenance wore suddenly a singular expression.  What she
saw was pretty and comfortable clothing&mdash;clothing of different kinds:
shoes, stockings, and gloves, and a warm and beautiful coat.  There
were even a nice hat and an umbrella.  They were all good and
expensive things, and on the pocket of the coat was pinned a paper, on
which were written these words: "To be worn every day.  Will be
replaced by others when necessary."</p>
<p>Miss Minchin was quite agitated.  This was an incident which
suggested strange things to her sordid mind.  Could it be that she had
made a mistake, after all, and that the neglected child had some powerful
though eccentric friend in the background&mdash;perhaps some previously
unknown relation, who had suddenly traced her whereabouts, and chose
to provide for her in this mysterious and fantastic way?  Relations were
sometimes very odd&mdash;particularly rich old bachelor uncles, who did not
care for having children near them.  A man of that sort might prefer to
overlook his young relation's welfare at a distance.  Such a person,
however, would be sure to be crotchety and hot-tempered enough to be
easily offended.  It would not be very pleasant if there were such a one,
and he should learn all the truth about the thin, shabby clothes, the scant
food, and the hard work.  She felt very queer indeed, and very
uncertain, and she gave a side glance at Sara.  </p>

<pb n="209"/>
<p>"Well," she said, in a voice such as she had never used since the
little girl lost her father, "someone is very kind to you.  As the things
have been sent, and you are to have new ones when they are worn out,
you may as well go and put them on and look respectable.  After you are
dressed you may come downstairs and learn your lessons in the
schoolroom.  You need not go out on any more errands today."</p>
<p>About half an hour afterward, when the schoolroom door opened
and Sara walked in, the entire seminary was struck dumb.</p>
<p>"My word!" ejaculated Jessie, jogging Lavinia's elbow.  "Look at
the Princess Sara!"</p>
<p>Everybody was looking, and when Lavinia looked she turned quite
red.</p>
<p>It was the Princess Sara indeed.  At least, since the days when she
had been a princess, Sara had never looked as she did now.  She did not
seem the Sara they had seen come down the back stairs a few hours ago.
She was dressed in the kind of frock Lavinia had been used to envying
her the possession of.  It was deep and warm in color, and beautifully
made.  Her slender feet looked as they had done when Jessie had
admired them, and the hair, whose heavy locks had made her look rather
like a Shetland pony when it fell loose about her small, odd face, was
tied back with a ribbon.</p>
<p>"Perhaps someone has left her a fortune," Jessie whispered.  "I
always thought something would happen to her.  She's so queer."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the diamond mines have suddenly appeared again," said
Lavinia, scathingly.  "Don't please her by staring at her in that way, you
silly thing."</p>
<p>"Sara," broke in Miss Minchin's deep voice, "come and sit
here."</p>
<p>And while the whole schoolroom stared and pushed

<pb n="210"/> with elbows, and scarcely made any effort to conceal its
excited curiosity, Sara went to her old seat of honor, and bent her head
over her books.</p>
<p>That night, when she went to her room, after she and Becky had
eaten their supper she sat and looked at the fire seriously for a long
time.</p>
<p>"Are you making something up in your head, miss?" Becky
inquired with respectful softness.  When Sara sat in silence and looked
into the coals with dreaming eyes it generally meant that she was making
a new story.  But this time she was not, and she shook her head.</p>
<p>"No," she answered.  "I am wondering what I ought to do."</p>

<p>Becky stared&mdash;still respectfully.  She was filled with something
approaching reverence for everything Sara did and said.</p>
<p>"I can't help thinking about my friend," Sara explained.  "If he
wants to keep himself a secret, it would be rude to try and find out who
he is.  But I do so want him to know how thankful I am to him&mdash;and how
happy he has made me.  Anyone who is kind wants to know when
people have been made happy.  They care for that more than for being
thanked.  I wish&mdash;I do wish&mdash;"</p>
<p>She stopped short because her eyes at that instant fell upon
something standing on a table in a corner.  It was something she had
found in the room when she came up to it only two days before.  It was
a little writing-case fitted with paper and envelopes and pens and
ink.</p>
<p>"Oh," she exclaimed, "why did I not think of that before?"</p>

<p>She rose and went to the corner and brought the case back to the
fire.</p>
<p>"I can write to him," she said joyfully, "and leave it on

<pb n="211"/> the table.  Then perhaps the person who takes the things
away will take it, too.  I won't ask him anything.  He won't mind my
thanking him, I feel sure."</p>
<p>So she wrote a note.  This is what she said: </p>
<p>I hope you will not think it is impolite that I should write this note
to you when you wish to keep yourself a secret. Please believe I do not
mean to be impolite or try to find out anything at all; only I want to
thank you for being so kind to me&mdash;so heavenly kind&mdash;and making
everything like a fairy story.  I am so grateful to you, and I am so
happy&mdash;and so is Becky.  Becky feels just as thankful as I do&mdash;it is all just
as beautiful and wonderful to her as it is to me.  We used to be so lonely
and cold and hungry, and now&mdash;oh, just think what you have done for us!
Please let me say just these words.  It seems as if I ought to say them.
Thank you&mdash;thank you&mdash;thank you!</p>
<p>The next morning she left this on the little table, and in the
evening it had been taken away with the other things; so she knew the
Magician had received it, and she was happier for the thought.  She was
reading one of her new books to Becky just before they went to their
respective beds, when her attention was attracted by a sound at the
skylight.  When she looked up from her page she saw that Becky had
heard the sound also, as she had turned her head to look and was
listening rather nervously.</p>
<p>"Something's there, miss," she whispered.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Sara, slowly.  "It sounds&mdash;rather like a cat&mdash;trying to
get in."</p>
<p>She left her chair and went to the skylight.  It was a queer little
sound she heard&mdash;like a soft scratching.  She suddenly  </p>
<p>

<pb n="212"/> remembered something and laughed.  She remembered
a quaint little intruder who had made his way into the attic once before.
She had seen him that very afternoon, sitting disconsolately on a table
before a window in the Indian gentleman's house.</p>
<p>"Suppose," she whispered in pleased excitement&mdash;"just suppose it
was the monkey who got away again.  Oh, I wish it was!"</p>
<p>She climbed on a chair, very cautiously raised the skylight, and
peeped out.  It had been snowing all day, and on the snow, quite near
her, crouched a tiny, shivering figure, whose small black face wrinkled
itself piteously at sight of her.</p>
<p>"It is the monkey," she cried out.  "He has crept out of the
Lascar's attic, and he saw the light."</p>
<p>Becky ran to her side.</p>
<p>"Are you going to let him in, miss?" she said.</p>
<p>"Yes," Sara answered joyfully.  "It's too cold for monkeys to be
out.  They're delicate.  I'll coax him in."</p>
<p>She put a hand out delicately, speaking in a coaxing voice&mdash;as she
spoke to the sparrows and to Melchisedec&mdash;as if she were some friendly
little animal herself.</p>
<p>"Come along, monkey darling," she said.  "I won't hurt
you."</p>
<p>He knew she would not hurt him.  He knew it before she laid her
soft, caressing little paw on him and drew him towards her.  He had felt
human love in the slim brown hands of Ram Dass, and he felt it in hers.
He let her lift him through the skylight, and when he found himself in
her arms he cuddled up to her breast and looked up into her face.</p>

<p>"Nice monkey! Nice monkey!" she crooned, kissing his funny
head.  "Oh, I do love little animal things."</p>
<p>He was evidently glad to get to the fire, and when she

<pb n="213"/> sat down and held him on her knee he looked from her
to Becky with mingled interest and appreciation.</p>
<p>"He is plain-looking, miss, ain't he?" said Becky.</p>
<p>"He looks like a very ugly baby," laughed Sara.  "I beg your
pardon, monkey; but I'm glad you are not a baby.  Your mother couldn't
be proud of you, and no one would dare to say you looked like any of
your relations.  Oh, I do like you!"</p>
<p>She leaned back in her chair and reflected.</p>
<p>"Perhaps he's sorry he's so ugly," she said, "and it's always on his
mind.  I wonder if he has a mind.  Monkey, my love, have you a
mind?"</p>
<p>But the monkey only put up a tiny paw and scratched his
head.</p>
<p>"What shall you do with him?" Becky asked.</p>
<p>"I shall let him sleep with me tonight, and then take him back to
the Indian gentleman tomorrow.  I am sorry to take you back, monkey;
but you must go.  You ought to be fondest of your own family; and I'm
not a real relation."</p>
<p>And when she went to bed she made him a nest at her feet, and he
curled up and slept there as if he were a baby and much pleased with his
quarters.   </p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="17" id="d21"><pb n="214"/>
<head>"It Is the Child!"</head>
<p>The next afternoon three members of the Large Family sat in the
Indian gentleman's library, doing their best to cheer him up.  They had
been allowed to come in to perform this office because he had specially
invited them.  He had been living in a state of suspense for some time,
and today he was waiting for a certain event very anxiously.  This event
was the return of Mr. Carmichael from Moscow.  His stay there had
been prolonged from week to week.  On his first arrival there, he had
not been able satisfactorily to trace the family he had gone in search of.
When he felt at last sure that he had found them and had gone to their
house, he had been told that they were absent on a journey.  His efforts
to reach them had been unavailing, so he had decided to remain in
Moscow until their return.  Mr. Carrisford sat in his reclining

<pb n="215"/> chair, and Janet sat on the floor beside him.  He was
very fond of Janet.  Nora had found a footstool, and Donald was astride
the tiger's head which ornamented the rug made of the animal's skin.  It
must be owned that he was riding it rather violently.</p>
<p>"Don't chirrup so loud, Donald," Janet said.  "When you come to
cheer an ill person up you don't cheer him up at the top of your voice.
Perhaps cheering up is too loud, Mr. Carrisford?" turning to the Indian
gentleman.</p>
<p>But he only patted her shoulder.</p>
<p>"No, it isn't," he answered.  "And it keeps me from thinking too
much."</p>
<p>"I'm going to be quiet," Donald shouted.  "We'll all be as quiet as
mice."</p>
<p>"Mice don't make a noise like that," said Janet.</p>
<p>Donald made a bridle of his handkerchief and bounced up and
down on the tiger's head.</p>
<p>"A whole lot of mice might," he said cheerfully.  "A thousand
mice might."</p>
<p>"I don't believe fifty thousand mice would," said Janet, severely;
"and we have to be as quiet as one mouse."</p>
<p>Mr. Carrisford laughed and patted her shoulder again.</p>
<p>"Papa won't be very long now," she said.  "May we talk about the
lost little girl?"</p>
<p>"I don't think I could talk much about anything else just now," the
Indian gentleman answered, knitting his forehead with a tired
look.</p>
<p>"We like her so much," said Nora.  "We call her the little un-fairy
princess."</p>
<p>"Why?" the Indian gentleman inquired, because the fancies of the
Large Family always made him forget things a little.</p>
<p>It was Janet who answered.</p>

<pb n="216"/>
<p>"It is because, though she is not exactly a fairy, she will be so rich
when she is found that she will be like a princess in a fairy tale.  We
called her the fairy princess at first, but it didn't quite suit."</p>
<p>"Is it true," said Nora, "that her papa gave all his money to a
friend to put in a mine that had diamonds in it, and then the friend
thought he had lost it all and ran away because he felt as if he was a
robber?"</p>
<p>"But he wasn't really, you know," put in Janet, hastily.</p>
<p>The Indian gentleman took hold of her hand quickly.</p>
<p>"No, he wasn't really," he said.</p>
<p>"I am sorry for the friend," Janet said; "I can't help it.  He didn't
mean to do it, and it would break his heart.  I am sure it would break
his heart."</p>
<p>"You are an understanding little woman, Janet," the Indian
gentleman said, and he held her hand close.</p>
<p>"Did you tell Mr. Carrisford," Donald shouted again, "about the
little-girl-who-is-n't-a-beggar?  Did you tell him she has new nice
clothes?  P'r'aps she's been found by somebody when she was
lost."</p>
<p>"There's a cab!" exclaimed Janet.  "It's stopping before the door.
It is papa!"</p>
<p>They all ran to the windows to look out.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's papa," Donald proclaimed.  "But there is no little
girl."</p>
<p>All three of them incontinently fled from the room and tumbled
into the hall.  It was in this way they always welcomed their father.
They were to be heard jumping up and down, clapping their hands, and
being caught up and kissed.</p>
<p>Mr. Carrisford made an effort to rise and sank back again.</p>
<p>"It is no use," he said.  "What a wreck I am!"</p>
<p>Mr. Carmichael's voice approached the door. </p>

<pb n="217"/>
<p>"No, children," he was saying; "you may come in after I have
talked to Mr. Carrisford.  Go and play with Ram Dass."</p>
<p>Then the door opened and he came in.  He looked rosier than
ever, and brought an atmosphere of freshness and health with him; but
his eyes were disappointed and anxious as they met the invalid's look of
eager question even as they grasped each other's hands.</p>
<p>"What news?" Mr. Carrisford asked.  "The child the Russian
people adopted?"</p>
<p>"She is not the child we are looking for," was Mr. Carmichael's
answer.  "She is much younger than Captain Crewe's little girl.  Her
name is Emily Carew.  I have seen and talked to her.  The Russians
were able to give me every detail."</p>
<p>How wearied and miserable the Indian gentleman looked! His hand
dropped from Mr. Carmichael's.</p>
<p>"Then the search has to be begun over again," he said.  "That is
all.  Please sit down."</p>
<p>Mr. Carmichael took a seat.  Somehow, he had gradually grown
fond of this unhappy man.  He was himself so well and happy, and so
surrounded by cheerfulness and love, that desolation and broken health
seemed pitifully unbearable things.  If there had been the sound of just
one gay little high-pitched voice in the house, it would have been so
much less forlorn.  And that a man should be compelled to carry about
in his breast the thought that he had seemed to wrong and desert a child
was not a thing one could face.</p>
<p>"Come, come," he said in his cheery voice; "we'll find her
yet."</p>
<p>"We must begin at once.  No time must be lost," Mr. Carrisford
fretted.  "Have you any new suggestion to make&mdash;any
whatsoever?"</p>

<pb n="218"/>
<p>Mr. Carmichael felt rather restless, and he rose and began to pace
the room with a thoughtful, though uncertain face.</p>
<p>"Well, perhaps," he said.  "I don't know what it may be worth.
The fact is, an idea occurred to me as I was thinking the thing over in
the train on the journey from Dover."</p>
<p>"What was it?  If she is alive, she is somewhere."</p>
<p>"Yes; she is somewhere.  We have searched the schools in Paris.
Let us give up Paris and begin in London.  That was my idea&mdash;to search
London."</p>
<p>"There are schools enough in London," said Mr. Carrisford.  Then
he slightly started, roused by a recollection.  "By the way, there is one
next door."</p>
<p>"Then we will begin there.  We cannot begin nearer than next
door."</p>
<p>"No," said Carrisford.  "There is a child there who interests me;
but she is not a pupil.  And she is a little dark, forlorn creature, as
unlike poor Crewe as a child could be."</p>
<p>Perhaps the Magic was at work again at that very moment&mdash;the
beautiful Magic.  It really seemed as if it might be so.  What was it that
brought Ram Dass into the room&mdash;even as his master spoke&mdash;salaaming
respectfully, but with a scarcely concealed touch of excitement in his
dark, flashing eyes?</p>
<p>"Sahib," he said, "the child herself has come&mdash;the child the sahib
felt pity for.  She brings back the monkey who had again run away to
her attic under the roof.  I have asked that she remain. lt was my
thought that it would please the sahib to see and speak with her."</p>

<p>"Who is she?" inquired Mr. Carmichael.</p>
<p>"God knows," Mr. Carrrisford answered.  "She is the child I
spoke of.  A little drudge at the school."  He waved his hand to Ram
Dass, and addressed him.  "Yes, I should

<pb n="219"/> like to see her.  Go and bring her in."  Then he turned
to Mr. Carmichael.  "While you have been away," he explained, "I have
been desperate.  The days were so dark and long.  Ram Dass told me of
this child's miseries, and together we invented a romantic plan to help
her.  I suppose it was a childish thing to do; but it gave me something to
plan and think of.  Without the help of an agile, soft-footed Oriental like
Ram Dass, however, it could not have been done."</p>
<p>Then Sara came into the room.  She carried the monkey in her
arms, and he evidently did not intend to part from her, if it could be
helped.  He was clinging to her and chattering, and the interesting
excitement of finding herself in the Indian gentleman's room had brought
a flush to Sara's cheeks.</p>
<p>"Your monkey ran away again," she said, in her pretty voice.
"He came to my garret window last night, and I took him in because it
was so cold.  I would have brought him back if it had not been so late.
I knew you were ill and might not like to be disturbed."</p>
<p>The Indian gentleman's hollow eyes dwelt on her with curious
interest.</p>
<p>"That was very thoughtful of you," he said.</p>
<p>Sara looked toward Ram Dass, who stood near the door.</p>
<p>"Shall I give him to the Lascar?" she asked.</p>
<p>"How do you know he is a Lascar?" said the Indian gentleman,
smiling a little.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know Lascars," Sara said, handing over the reluctant
monkey.  "I was born in India."</p>
<p>The Indian gentleman sat upright so suddenly, and with such a
change of expression, that she was for a moment quite startled.</p>
<p>"You were born in India," he exclaimed, "were you? Come here."
And he held out his hand.</p>

<pb n="220"/>
<p>Sara went to him and laid her hand in his, as he seemed to want to
take it.  She stood still, and her green-gray eyes met his wonderingly.
Something seemed to be the matter with him.</p>
<p>"You live next door?" he demanded.</p>
<p>"Yes; I live at Miss Minchin's seminary."</p>
<p>"But you are not one of her pupils?"</p>
<p>A strange little smile hovered about Sara's mouth.  She hesitated a
moment.</p>
<p>"I don't think I know exactly what I am," she replied.</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"At first I was a pupil, and a parlor boarder; but now&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You were a pupil!  What are you now?"</p>
<p>The queer little sad smile was on Sara's lips again.</p>
<p>"I sleep in the attic, next to the scullery maid," she said.  "I run
errands for the cook&mdash;I do anything she tells me; and I teach the little
ones their lessons."</p>
<p>"Question her, Carmichael," said Mr. Carrisford, sinking back as
if he had lost his strength.  "Question her; I cannot."</p>
<p>The big, kind father of the Large Family knew how to question
little girls.  Sara realized how much practice he had had when he spoke
to her in his nice, encouraging voice.</p>
<p>"What do you mean by 'At first,' my child?" he inquired.</p>
<p>"When I was first taken there by my papa."</p>
<p>"Where is your papa?"</p>
<p>"He died," said Sara, very quietly.  "He lost all his money and
there was none left for me.  There was no one to take care of me or to
pay Miss Minchin."</p>
<p>"Carmichael!" the Indian gentleman cried out loudly.
"Carmichael!"</p>
<p>"We must not frighten her," Mr. Carmichael said aside

<pb n="221"/> to him in a quick, low voice.  And he added aloud to
Sara, "So you were sent up into the attic, and made into a little drudge.
That was about it, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>"There was no one to take care of me," said Sara.  "There was no
money; I belong to nobody."</p>
<p>"How did your father lose his money?" the Indian gentleman broke
in breathlessly.</p>
<p>"He did not lose it himself," Sara answered, wondering still more
each moment.  "He had a friend he was very fond of&mdash;he was very fond
of him.  It was his friend who took his money.  He trusted his friend too
much."</p>
<p>The Indian gentleman's breath came more quickly.</p>
<p>"The friend might have meant to do no harm," he said. "It might
have happened through a mistake."</p>
<p>Sara did not know how unrelenting her quiet young voice sounded
as she answered.  If she had known, she would surely have tried to
soften it for the Indian gentleman's sake.</p>
<p>"The suffering was just as bad for my papa," she said. It killed
him."</p>
<p>"What was your father's name?" the Indian gentleman said.  "Tell
me."</p>
<p>"His name was Ralph Crewe," Sara answered, feeling startled.
"Captain Crewe.  He died in India."</p>
<p>The haggard face contracted, and Ram Dass sprang to his master's
side.</p>
<p>"Carmichael," the invalid gasped, "it is the child&mdash;the
child!"</p>
<p>For a moment Sara thought he was going to die.  Ram Dass
poured out drops from a bottle, and held them to his lips.  Sara stood
near, trembling a little.  She looked in a bewildered way at Mr.
Carmichael.</p>
<p>"What child am I?" she faltered.</p>
<p>"He was your father's friend," Mr. Carmichael answered

<pb n="222"/> her.  "Don't be frightened.  We have been looking for
you for two years."</p>
<p>Sara put her hand up to her forehead, and her mouth trembled.
She spoke as if she were in a dream.</p>
<p>"And I was at Miss Minchin's all the while," she half whispered.
"Just on the other side of the wall."</p>
</div1>


<div1 type="chapter" n="18" id="d22"><pb n="223"/>
<head>"I Tried Not to Be"</head>
<p>It was pretty, comfortable Mrs. Carmichael who explained
everything.  She was sent for at once, and came across the square to take
Sara into her warm arms and make clear to her all that had happened.
The excitement of the totally unexpected discovery had been temporarily
almost overpowering to Mr. Carrisford in his weak condition.</p>
<p>"Upon my word," he said faintly to Mr. Carmichael, when it was
suggested that the little girl should go into another room.  "I feel as if I
do not want to lose sight of her."</p>
<p>"I will take care of her," Janet said, "and mamma will

<pb n="224"/> come in a few minutes."  And it was Janet who led her
away.</p>
<p>"We're so glad you are found," she said.  "You don't know how
glad we are that you are found."</p>
<p>Donald stood with his hands in his pockets, and gazed at Sara with
reflecting and self-reproachful eyes.</p>
<p>"If I'd just asked what your name was when I gave you my
sixpence," he said, "you would have told me it was Sara Crewe, and
then you would have been found in a minute."     Then Mrs. Carmichael
came in.  She looked very much moved, and suddenly took Sara in her
arms and kissed her.</p>
<p>"You look bewildered, poor child," she said.  "And it is not to be
wondered at."</p>
<p>Sara could only think of one thing.</p>
<p>"Was he," she said, with a glance toward the closed door of the
library&mdash;"was he the wicked friend?  Oh, do tell me!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Carmichael was crying as she kissed her again.  She felt as if
she ought to be kissed very often because she had not been kissed for so
long.</p>
<p>"He was not wicked, my dear," she answered.  "He did not really
lose your papa's money.  He only thought he had lost it; and because he
loved him so much his grief made him so ill that for a time he was not
in his right mind.  He almost died of brain fever, and long before he
began to recover your poor papa was dead."</p>
<p>"And he did not know where to find me," murmured Sara.  "And I
was so near."  Somehow, she could not forget that she had been so
near.</p>
<p>"He believed you were in school in France," Mrs. Carmichael
explained.  "And he was continually misled by false clues.  He has
looked for you everywhere.  When he saw you pass by, looking so sad
and neglected, he did not dream that you were his friend's poor child;
but because you were a

<pb n="225"/> little girl, too, he was sorry for you, and wanted to
make you happier.  And he told Ram Dass to climb into your attic
window and try to make you comfortable."</p>
<p>Sara gave a start of joy; her whole look changed.</p>
<p>"Did Ram Dass bring the things?" she cried out.  "Did he tell Ram
Dass to do it?  Did he make the dream that came true?"</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear&mdash;yes!  He is kind and good, and he was sorry for
you, for little lost Sara Crewe's sake."</p>
<p>The library door opened and Mr. Carmichael appeared, calling
Sara to him with a gesture.</p>
<p>"Mr. Carrisford is better already," he said.  "He wants you to
come to him."</p>
<p>Sara did not wait.  When the Indian gentleman looked at her as she
entered, he saw that her face was all alight.</p>
<p>She went and stood before his chair, with her hands clasped
together against her breast.</p>
<p>"You sent the things to me," she said, in a joyful emotional little
voice, "the beautiful, beautiful things?  You sent them!"</p>
<p>"Yes, poor, dear child, I did," he answered her.  He was weak
and broken with long illness and trouble, but he looked at her with the
look she remembered in her father's eyes&mdash;that look of loving her and
wanting to take her in his arms.  It made her kneel down by him, just as
she used to kneel by her father when they were the dearest friends and
lovers in the world.</p>
<p>"Then it is you who are my friend," she said; "it is you who are
my friend!"  And she dropped her face on his thin hand and kissed it
again and again.</p>
<p>"The man will be himself again in three weeks," Mr. Carmichael
said aside to his wife.  "Look at his face already."</p>
<p>In fact, he did look changed.  Here was the "Little Missus,"

<pb n="226"/> and he had new things to think of and plan for already.
In the first place, there was Miss Minchin.  She must be interviewed and
told of the change which had taken place in the fortunes of her
pupil.</p>
<p>Sara was not to return to the seminary at all.  The Indian
gentleman was very determined upon that point.  She must remain where
she was, and Mr. Carmichael should go and see Miss Minchin
himself</p>
<p>"I am glad I need not go back," said Sara.  "She will be very
angry.  She does not like me; though perhaps it is my fault, because I do
not like her."</p>
<p>But, oddly enough, Miss Minchin made it unnecessary for Mr.
Carmichael to go to her, by actually coming in search of her pupil
herself.  She had wanted Sara for something, and on inquiry had heard
an astonishing thing.  One of the housemaids had seen her steal out of
the area with something hidden under her cloak, and had also seen her
go up the steps of the next door and enter the house.</p>
<p>"What does she mean!" cried Miss Minchin to Miss Amelia.</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure, sister," answered Miss Amelia.  "Unless
she has made friends with him because he has lived in India."</p>
<p>"It would be just like her to thrust herself upon him and try to gain
his sympathies in some such impertinent fashion," said Miss Minchin.
"She must have been in the house for two hours.  I will not allow such
presumption.  I shall go and inquire into the matter, and apologize for
her intrusion."</p>
<p>Sara was sitting on a footstool close to Mr. Carrisford's knee, and
listening to some of the many things he felt it necessary to try to explain
to her, when Ram Dass announced the visitor's arrival.  </p>

<pb n="227"/>
<p>Sara rose involuntarily, and became rather pale; but Mr.
Carrisford saw that she stood quietly, and showed none of the ordinary
signs of child terror.</p>
<p>Miss Minchin entered the room with a sternly dignified manner.
She was correctly and well dressed, and rigidly polite.</p>
<p>"I am sorry to disturb Mr. Carrisford," she said; "but I have
explanations to make.  I am Miss Minchin, the proprietress of the Young
Ladies' Seminary next door."</p>
<p>The Indian gentleman looked at her for a moment in silent
scrutiny.  He was a man who had naturally a rather hot temper, and he
did not wish it to get too much the better of him.</p>
<p>"So you are Miss Minchin?" he said.</p>
<p>"I am, sir."</p>
<p>"In that case," the Indian gentleman replied, "you have arrived at
the right time.  My solicitor, Mr. Carmichael, was just on the point of
going to see you."</p>
<p>Mr. Carmichael bowed slightly, and Miiss Minchin looked from
him to Mr. Carrisford in amazement.</p>
<p>"Your solicitor!" she said.  "I do not understand.  I have come
here as a matter of duty.  I have just discovered that you have been
intruded upon through the forwardness of one of my pupils&mdash;a charity
pupil.  I came to explain that she intruded without my knowledge."  She
turned upon Sara.  "Go home at once," she commanded indignantly.
"You shall be severely punished.  Go home at once."</p>
<p>The Indian gentleman drew Sara to his side and patted her
hand.</p>
<p>"She is not going."</p>
<p>Miss Minchin felt rather as if she must be losing her senses.</p>

<p>"Not going!" she repeated.</p>

<pb n="228"/>
<pb n="229"/>
<p>"No," said Mr. Carrisford.  "She is not going home&mdash;if you give
your house that name.  Her home for the future will be with me."</p>

<p>Miss Minchin fell back in amazed indignation.</p>
<p>"With you!  With you, sir!  What does this mean?"</p>
<p>"Kindly explain the matter, Carmichael," said the Indian
gentleman; "and get it over as quickly as possible."  And he made Sara
sit down again, and held her hands in his&mdash;which was another trick of her
papa's.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Carmichael explained&mdash;in the quiet, leveltoned, steady
manner of a man who knew his subject, and all its legal significance,
which was a thing Miss Minchin understood as a business woman, and
did not enjoy.</p>
<p>"Mr.  Carrisford, madam," he said, "was an intimate friend of the
late Captain Crewe.  He was his partner in certain large investments.
The fortune which Captain Crewe supposed he had lost has been
recovered, and is now in Mr. Carrisford's hands."</p>
<p>"The fortune!" cried Miss Minchin; and she really lost color as she
uttered the exclamation.  "Sara's fortune!"</p>
<p>"It will be Sara's fortune," replied Mr. Carmichael, rather coldly.
"It is Sara's fortune now, in fact.  Certain events have increased it
enormously.  The diamond mines have retrieved themselves."</p>
<p>"The diamond mines!" Miss Minchin gasped out.  If this was true,
nothing so horrible, she felt, had ever happened to her since she was
born.</p>
<p>"The diamond mines," Mr. Carmichael repeated, and he could not
help adding, with a rather sly, unlawyer-like smile, "There are not many
princesses, Miss Minchin, who are richer than your little charity pupil,
Sara Crewe, will be.  Mr. Carrisford has been searching for her for
nearly two years; he has found her at last, and he will keep her."
</p>

<pb n="230"/>
<p>After which he asked Miss Minchin to sit down while he explained
matters to her fully, and went into such detail as was necessary to make
it quite clear to her that Sara's future was an assured one, and that what
had seemed to be lost was to be restored to her tenfold; also, that she
had in Mr. Carrisford a guardian as well as a friend.</p>
<p>Miss Minchin was not a clever woman, and in her excitement she
was silly enough to make one desperate effort to regain what she could
not help seeing she had lost through her worldly folly.</p>
<p>"He found her under my care," she protested.  "I have done
everything for her.  But for me she should have starved in the
streets."</p>
<p>Here the Indian gentleman lost his temper.</p>
<p>"As to starving in the streets," he said, "she might have starved
more comfortably there than in your attic."</p>
<p>"Captain Crewe left her in my charge," Miss Minchin argued.
"She must return to it until she is of age.  She can be a parlor boarder
again.  She must finish her education.  The law will interfere in my
behalf"</p>
<p>"Come, come, Miss Minchin," Mr. Carmichael interposed, "the
law will do nothing of the sort.  If Sara herself wishes to return to you, I
dare say Mr. Carrisford might not refuse to allow it.  But that rests with
Sara."</p>
<p>"Then," said Miss Minchin, "I appeal to Sara.  I have not spoiled
you, perhaps," she said awkwardly to the little girl; "but you know that
your papa was pleased with your progress.  And&mdash;ahem&mdash;I have always
been fond of you."</p>
<p>Sara's green-gray eyes fixed themselves on her with the quiet,
clear look Miss Minchin particularly disliked.</p>
<p>"Have you, Miss Minchin?" she said.  "I did not know
that."</p>
<p>Miss Minchin reddened and drew herself up.  </p>

<pb n="231"/>
<p>"You ought to have known it," said she; "but children,
unfortunately, never know what is best for them.  Amelia and I always
said you were the cleverest child in the school.  Will you not do your
duty to your poor papa and come home with me?"</p>
<p>Sara took a step toward her and stood still.  She was thinking of
the day when she had been told that she belonged to nobody, and was in
danger of being turned into the street; she was thinking of the cold,
hungry hours she had spent alone with Emily and Melchisedec in the
attic.  She looked Miss Minchin steadily in the face.</p>
<p>"You know why I will not go home with you, Miss Minchin," she
said; "you know quite well."</p>
<p>A hot flush showed itself on Miss Minchin's hard, angry
face.</p>
<p>"You will never see your companions again," she began.  "I will
see that Ermengarde and Lottie are kept away&mdash;"</p>
<p>Mr. Carmichael stopped her with polite firmness.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," he said; "she will see anyone she wishes to see.
The parents of Miss Crewe's fellow-pupils are not likely to refuse her
invitations to visit her at her guardian's house.  Mr. Carrisford will
attend to that."</p>
<p>It must be confessed that even Miss Minchin flinched.  This was
worse than the eccentric bachelor uncle who might have a peppery
temper and be easily offended at the treatment of his niece.  A woman of
sordid mind could easily believe that most people would not refuse to
allow their children to remain friends with a little heiress of diamond
mines.  And if Mr. Carrisford chose to tell certain of her patrons how
unhappy Sara Crewe had been made, many unpleasant things might
happen.</p>
<p>"You have not undertaken an easy charge," she said to the Indian
gentleman, as she turned to leave the room; "you

<pb n="232"/> will discover that very soon.  The child is neither
truthful nor grateful.  I suppose"&mdash;to Sara&mdash;"that you feel now that you
are a princess again."</p>
<p>Sara looked down and flushed a little, because she thought her pet
fancy might not be easy for strangers&mdash;even nice ones&mdash;to understand at
first.</p>
<p>"I&mdash;tried not to be anything else," she answered in a low
voice&mdash;"even when I was coldest and hungriest&mdash;I tried not to be."</p>

<p>"Now it will not be necessary to try," said Miss Minchin, acidly,
as Ram Dass salaamed her out of the room.</p>
<p>She returned home and, going to her sitting room, sent at once for
Miss Amelia.  She sat closeted with her all the rest of the afternoon, and
it must be admitted that poor Miss Amelia passed through more than one
bad quarter of an hour.  She shed a good many tears, and mopped her
eyes a good deal.  One of her unfortunate remarks almost caused her
sister to snap her head entirely off, but it resulted in an unusual
manner.</p>
<p>"I'm not as clever as you, sister," she said, "and I am always
afraid to say things to you for fear of making you angry.  Perhaps if I
were not so timid it would be better for the school and for both of us.  I
must say I've often thought it would have been better if you had been
less severe on Sara Crewe, and had seen that she was decently dressed
and more comfortable.  I know she was worked too hard for a child of
her age, and I know she was only half fed&mdash;"</p>
<p>"How dare you say such a thing!" exclaimed Miss Minchin.</p>

<p>"I don't know how I dare," Miss Amelia answered, with a kind of
reckless courage; "but now I've begun I may as well finish, whatever
happens to me.  The child was a clever

<pb n="233"/> child and a good child&mdash;and she would have paid you
for any kindness you had shown her.  But you didn't show her any.  The
fact was, she was too clever for you, and you always disliked her for
that reason.  She used to see through us both&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Amelia!" gasped her infuriated elder, looking as if she would box
her ears and knock her cap off, as she had often done to Becky.</p>
<p>But Miss Amelia's disappointment had made her hysterical enough
not to care what occurred next.</p>
<p>"She did!  She did!" she cried.  "She saw through us both.  She
saw that you were a hard-hearted, worldly woman, and that I was a
weak fool, and that we were both of us vulgar and mean enough to
grovel on our knees for her money, and behave ill to her because it was
taken from her&mdash;though she behaved herself like a little princess even
when she was a beggar.  She did&mdash;she did&mdash;like a little princess!"  And
her hysterics got the better of the poor woman, and she began to laugh
and cry both at once, and rock herself backward and forward.</p>
<p>"And now you've lost her," she cried wildly; "and some other
school will get her and her money; and if she were like any other child
she'd tell how she's been treated, and all our pupils would be taken away
and we should be ruined.  And it serves us right; but it serves you right
more than it does me, for you are a hard woman, Maria Minchin, you're
a hard, selfish, worldly woman!"</p>
<p>And she was in danger of making so much noise with her
hysterical chokes and gurgles that her sister was obliged to go to her and
apply salts and sal volatile to quiet her, instead of pouring forth her
indignation at her audacity.</p>
<p>And from that time forward, it may be mentioned, the elder Miss
Minchin actually began to stand a little in awe of

<pb n="234"/> a sister who, while she looked so foolish, was evidently
not quite so foolish as she looked, and might, consequently, break out
and speak truths people did not want to hear.</p>
<p>That evening, when the pupils were gathered together before the
fire in the schoolroom, as was their custom before going to bed,
Ermengarde came in with a letter in her hand and a queer expression on
her round face.  It was queer because, while it was an expression of
delighted excitement, it was combined with such amazement as seemed
to belong to a kind of shock just received.</p>
<p>"What is the matter?" cried two or three voices at once.</p>
<p>"Is it anything to do with the row that has been going on?" said
Lavinia, eagerly.  "There has been such a row in Miss Minchin's room,
Miss Amelia has had something like hysterics and has had to go to
bed."</p>
<p>Ermengarde answered them slowly as if she were half
stunned.</p>
<p>"I have just had this letter from Sara," she said, holding it out to
let them see what a long letter it was.</p>
<p>"From Sara!"  Every voice joined in that exclamation.</p>
<p>"Where is she?" almost shrieked Jessie.</p>
<p>"Next door," said Ermengarde, "with the Indian
gentleman."</p>
<p>"Where?  Where?  Has she been sent away?  Does Miss Minchin
know?  Was the row about that?  Why did she write? Tell us!  Tell
us!"</p>
<p>There was a perfect babel, and Lottie began to cry
plaintively.</p>
<p>Ermengarde answered them slowly as if she were half plunged out
into what, at the moment, seemed the most important and self-explaining
thing.</p>
<p>"There were diamond mines," she said stoutly; "there were!"
</p>

<pb n="235"/>
<p>Open mouths and open eyes confronted her.</p>
<p>"They were real," she hurried on.  "It was all a mistake about
them.  Something happened for a time, and Mr. Carrisford thought they
were ruined&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Who is Mr. Carrisford?" shouted Jessie.</p>
<p>"The Indian gentleman.  And Captain Crewe thought so, too&mdash;and
he died; and Mr. Carrisford had brain fever and ran away, and he almost
died.  And he did not know where Sara was.  And it turned out that
there were millions and millions of diamonds in the mines; and half of
them belong to Sara; and they belonged to her when she was living in
the attic with no one but Melchisedec for a friend, and the cook ordering
her about.  And Mr. Carrisford found her this afternoon, and he has got
her in his home&mdash;and she will never come back&mdash;and she will be more a
princess than she ever was&mdash;a hundred and fifty thousand times more.
And I am going to see her tomorrow afternoon.  There!"</p>
<p>Even Miss Minchin herself could scarcely have controlled the
uproar after this; and though she heard the noise, she did not try.  She
was not in the mood to face anything more than she was facing in her
room, while Miss Amelia was weeping in bed.  She knew that the news
had penetrated the walls in some mysterious manner, and that every
servant and every child would go to bed talking about it.</p>
<p>So until almost midnight the entire seminary, realizing somehow
that all rules were laid aside, crowded round Ermengarde in the
schoolroom and heard read and re-read the letter containing a story
which was quite as wonderful as any Sara herself had ever invented, and
which had the amazing charm of having happened to Sara herself and the
mystic Indian gentleman in the very next house.</p>
<p>Becky, who had heard it also, managed to creep up stairs earlier
than usual.  She wanted to get away from people and

<pb n="236"/> go and look at the little magic room once more.  She
did not know what would happen to it.  It was not likely that it would be
left to Miss Minchin.  It would be taken away, and the attic would be
bare and empty again.  Glad as she was for Sara's sake, she went up the
last flight of stairs with a lump in her throat and tears blurring her sight.
There would be no fire tonight, and no rosy lamp; no supper, and no
princess sitting in the glow reading or telling stories&mdash;no princess!</p>

<p>She choked down a sob as she pushed the attic door open, and then
she broke into a low cry.</p>
<p>The lamp was flushing the room, the fire was blazing, the supper
was waiting; and Ram Dass was standing smiling into her startled
face.</p>
<p>"Missee sahib remembered," he said.  "She told the sahib all.  She
wished you to know the good fortune which has befallen her.  Behold a
letter on the tray.  She has written.  She did not wish that you should go
to sleep unhappy.  The sahib commands you to come to him tomorrow.
You are to be the attendant of missee sahib.  Tonight I take these things
back over the roof."</p>
<p>And having said this with a beaming face, he made a little salaam
and slipped through the skylight with an agile silentness of movement
which showed Becky how easily he had done it before.</p>

<div1 type="chapter" n="19" id="d23"><pb n="237"/>
<head>Anne</head>
<p>Never had such joy reigned in the nursery of the Large Family.
Never had they dreamed of such delights as resulted from an intimate
acquaintance with the little-girl-who-was-not-a-beggar.  The mere fact of
her sufferings and adventures made her a priceless possession.
Everybody wanted to be told over and over again the things which had
happened to her.  When one was sitting by a warm fire in a big, glowing
room, it was quite delightful to hear how cold it could be in an attic.  It
must be admitted that the attic was rather delighted in, and that its
coldness and bareness quite sank into insignificance when Melchisedec
was remembered, and one heard about the sparrows and things one could
see if one climbed on the table and stuck one's head and shoulders out of
the skylight.</p>
<p>Of course the thing loved best was the story of the

<pb n="238"/> banquet and the dream which was true.  Sara told it for
the first time the day after she had been found.  Several members of the
Large Family came to take tea with her, and as they sat or curled up on
the hearth-rug she told the story in her own way, and the Indian
gentleman listened and watched her.  When she had finished she looked
up at him and put her hand on his knee.</p>
<p>"That is my part," she said.  "Now won't you tell your part of it,
Uncle Tom?"  He had asked her to call him always "Uncle Tom."  "I
don't know your part yet, and it must be beautiful."</p>
<p>So he told them how, when he sat alone, ill and dull and irritable,
Ram Dass had tried to distract him by describing the passers by, and
there was one child who passed oftener than any one else; he had begun
to be interested in her&mdash;partly perhaps because he was thinking a great
deal of a little girl, and partly because Ram Dass had been able to relate
the incident of his visit to the attic in chase of the monkey.  He had
described its cheerless look, and the bearing of the child, who seemed as
if she was not of the class of those who were treated as drudges and
servants.  Bit by bit, Ram Dass had made discoveries concerning the
wretchedness of her life.  He had found out how easy a matter it was to
climb across the few yards of roof to the skylight, and this fact had been
the beginning of all that followed.</p>
<p>"Sahib," he had said one day, "I could cross the slates and make
the child a fire when she is out on some errand.  When she returned, wet
and cold, to find it blazing, she would think a magician had done
it."</p>
<p>The idea had been so fanciful that Mr. Carrisford's sad face had
lighted with a smile, and Ram Dass had been so filled with rapture that
he had enlarged upon it and explained to his master how simple it would
be to accomplish numbers

<pb n="239"/> of other things.  He had shown a childlike pleasure and
invention, and the preparations for the carrying out of the plan had filled
many a day with interest which would otherwise have dragged wearily.
On the night of the frustrated banquet Ram Dass had kept watch, all his
packages being in readiness in the attic which was his own; and the
person who was to help him had waited with him, as interested as
himself in the odd adventure.  Ram Dass had been lying flat upon the
slates, looking in at the skylight, when the banquet had come to its
disastrous conclusion; he had been sure of the profoundness of Sara's
wearied sleep; and then, with a dark lantern, he had crept into the room,
while his companion remained outside and handed the things to him.
When Sara had stirred ever so faintly, Ram Dass had closed the
lanternslide and lain flat upon the floor.  These and many other exciting
things the children found out by asking a thousand questions.</p>
<p>"I am so glad," Sara said, "it was you who were my
friend!"</p>
<p>There never were such friends as these two became.  Somehow,
they seemed to suit each other in a wonderful way.  The Indian
gentleman had never had a companion he liked quite as much as he liked
Sara.  In a month's time he was, as Mr. Carmichael had prophesied he
would be, a new man.  He was always amused and interested, and he
began to find an actual pleasure in the possession of the wealth he had
imagined that he loathed the burden of.  There were so many charming
things to plan for Sara.  There was a little joke between them that he
was a magician, and it was one of his pleasures to invent things to
surprise her.  She found beautiful new flowers growing in her room,
whimsical little gifts tucked under pillows, and once, as they sat together
in the evening, they heard the scratch of a heavy paw on the

<pb n="240"/> door, and when Sara went to find out what it was, there
stood a great dog&mdash;a splendid Russian boarhound&mdash;with a grand silver and
gold collar bearing an inscription.  "I am Boris," it read; "I serve the
Princess Sara."</p>
<p>There was nothing the Indian gentleman loved more than the
recollection of the little princess in rags and tatters.  The afternoons in
which the Large Family, or Ermengarde and Lottie, gathered to rejoice
together were very delightful.  But the hours when Sara and the Indian
gentleman sat alone and read or talked had a special charm of their own.
During their passing many interesting things occurred.</p>
<p>One evening, Mr. Carrisford, looking up from his book, noticed
that his companion had not stirred for some time, but sat gazing into the
fire.</p>
<p>"What are you 'supposing,' Sara?" he asked.</p>
<p>Sara looked up, with a bright color on her cheek.</p>
<p>"I was supposing," she said; "I was remembering that hungry day,
and a child I saw."</p>
<p>"But there were a great many hungry days," said the Indian
gentleman, with rather a sad tone in his voice.  "Which hungry day was
it?"</p>
<p>"I forgot you didn't know," said Sara.  "It was the day the dream
came true."</p>
<p>Then she told him the story of the bun shop, and the fourpence she
picked up out of the sloppy mud, and the child who was hungrier than
herself.  She told it quite simply, and in as few words as possible; but
somehow the Indian gentleman found it necessary to shade his eyes with
his hand and look down at the carpet.</p>
<p>"And I was supposing a kind of plan," she said, when she had
finished.  "I was thinking I should like to do something."</p>
<p>"What was it?" said Mr. Carrisford, in a low tone.  "You may do
anything you like to do, princess."  </p>

<pb n="241"/>
<p>"I was wondering," rather hesitated Sara&mdash;"you know, you say I
have so much money&mdash;I was wondering if I could go to see the
bun-woman, and tell her that if, when hungry children&mdash;particularly on
those dreadful days&mdash;come and sit on the steps, or look in at the window,
she would just call them in and give them something to eat, she might
send the bills to me.  Could I do that?"</p>
<p>"You shall do it tomorrow morning," said the Indian
gentleman.</p>
<p>"Thank you," said Sara.  "You see, I know what it is to be
hungry, and it is very hard when one cannot even pretend it
away."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, my dear," said the Indian gentleman.  "Yes, yes, it
must be.  Try to forget it.  Come and sit on this footstool near my knee,
and only remember you are a princess."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Sara, smiling; "and I can give buns and bread to the
populace."  And she went and sat on the stool, and the Indian gentleman
(he used to like her to call him that, too, sometimes) drew her small
dark head down on his knee and stroked her hair.</p>
<p>The next morning, Miss Minchin, in looking out of her window,
saw the things she perhaps least enjoyed seeing.  The Indian gentleman's
carriage, with its tall horses, drew up before the door of the next house,
and its owner and a little figure, warm with soft, rich furs, descended
the steps to get into it.  The little figure was a familiar one, and
reminded Miss Minchin of days in the past.  It was followed by another
as familiar&mdash;the sight of which she found very irritating.  It was Becky,
who, in the character of delighted attendant, always accompanied her
young mistress to her carriage, carrying wraps and belongings.  Already
Becky had a pink, round face.</p>
<p>A little later the carriage drew up before the door of the baker's
shop, and its occupants got out, oddly enough, just

<pb n="242"/> as the bun-woman was putting a tray of smoking-hot
buns into the window.</p>
<p>When Sara entered the shop the woman turned and looked at her,
and, leaving the buns, came and stood behind the counter.  For a
moment she looked at Sara very hard indeed, and then her good-natured
face lighted up.</p>
<p>"I'm sure that I remember you, miss," she said.  "And
yet&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Sara; "once you gave me six buns for fourpence,
and&mdash;"</p>
<p>"And you gave five of 'em to a beggar child," the woman broke in
on her.  "I've always remembered it.  I couldn't make it out at first."
She turned round to the Indian gentleman and spoke her next words to
him.  "I beg your pardon, sir, but there's not many young people that
notices a hungry face in that way; and I've thought of it many a time.
Excuse the liberty, miss,"&mdash;to Sara&mdash;"but you look rosier and&mdash;well, better
than you did that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I am better, thank you," said Sara.  "And&mdash;I am much
happier&mdash;and I have come to ask you to do something for me."</p>
<p>"Me, miss!" exclaimed the bun-woman, smiling cheerfully.
"Why, bless you!  Yes, miss.  What can I do?"</p>
<p>And then Sara, leaning on the counter, made her little proposal
concerning the dreadful days and the hungry waifs and the buns.</p>
<p>The woman watched her, and listened with an astonished
face.</p>
<p>"Why, bless me!" she said again when she had heard it all; it'll be
a pleasure to me to do it.  I am a working-woman myself and cannot
afford to do much on my own account, and there's sights of trouble on
every side; but, if you'll excuse me, I'm bound to say I've given away
many a bit of

<pb n="243"/> bread since that wet afternoon, just along o' thinking of
you&mdash;an' how wet an' cold you was, an' how hungry you looked; an' yet
you gave away your hot buns as if you was a princess."</p>
<p>The Indian gentleman smiled involuntarily at this, and Sara smiled
a little, too, remembering what she had said to herself when she put the
buns down on the ravenous child's ragged lap.</p>
<p>"She looked so hungry," she said.  "She was even hungrier than I
was."</p>
<p>"She was starving," said the woman.  "Many's the time she's told
me of it since&mdash;how she sat there in the wet, and felt as if a wolf was
a-tearing at her poor young insides."</p>
<p>"Oh, have you seen her since then?" exclaimed Sara.  "Do you
know where she is?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I do," answered the woman, smiling more goodnaturedly
than ever.  "Why, she's in that there back room, miss, an' has been for
a month; an' a decent, well-meanin' girl she's goin' to turn out, an' such
a help to me in the shop an' in the kitchen as you'd scarce believe,
knowin' how she's lived."</p>
<p>She stepped to the door of the little back parlor and spoke; and the
next minute a girl came out and followed her behind the counter.  And
actually it was the beggar-child, clean and neatly clothed, and looking as
if she had not been hungry for a long time.  She looked shy, but she had
a nice face, now that she was no longer a savage, and the wild look had
gone from her eyes.  She knew Sara in an instant, and stood and looked
at her as if she could never look enough.</p>
<p>"You see," said the woman, "I told her to come when she was
hungry, and when she'd come I'd give her odd jobs to do; an' I found
she was willing, and somehow I got to like her; and the end of it was,
I've given her a place an' a

<pb n="244"/>


<pb n="245"/> home, and she helps me, an' behaves well, an' is as
thankful as a girl can be.  Her name's Anne.  She has no other."</p>
<p>The children stood and looked at each other for a few minutes; and
then Sara took her hand out of her muff and held it out across the
counter, and Anne took it, and they looked straight into each other's
eyes.</p>
<p>"I am so glad," Sara said.  "And I have just thought of something.
Perhaps Mrs. Brown will let you be the one to give the buns and bread
to the children.  Perhaps you would like to do it because you know what
it is to be hungry, too.</p>
<p>"Yes, miss," said the girl.</p>
<p>And, somehow, Sara felt as if she understood her, though she said
so little, and only stood still and looked and looked after her as she went
out of the shop with the Indian gentleman, and they got into the carriage
and drove away.</p>
