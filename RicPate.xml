<p>We are a nation of inventors, and every invention is patented; 
yet, curiously, there is no subject quite so void of interest to the 
average gentle reader," as patents and patent-rights.  Why, it is 
hard to say; for there is no factor of modern civilization that 
comes home to every one more constantly or more closely.  Indeed, in 
their ubiquity and unresting action, patents have been aptly likened 
to the taxes which Sydney Smith described as following the overtaxed 
Englishmen of his day from the cradle to the grave.  Does the 
comparison hold as well, as some assert, in respect to 
burdensomeness? 
</p><p>It is not to be expected that an institution which enters so 
potently into our life-conditions as the patent-system does, should 
be, in all its workings, invariably beneficial.  Human interests are 
very conflicting.  The sunshine or the rain that makes my harvest 
sure may spoil yours; and, as with the forces of nature, so with 
human contrivances.  They must of necessity go contrary to our 
wishes sometimes.  The most we can reasonably ask of any social or 
govern 
<pb n="100"/>  
mental plan is that it shall be, in the main and in the 
long run, clearly beneficent.  If the good it does more than 
balances the evil that attends its working, and if there is nothing 
at hand that can serve us better, the part of wisdom is to make the 
best of it, changing, if at all, only with a view to improvement.  
From this stand-point let us examine the objections raised against 
this system. 
</p><p>Patents for inventions are based on the theory of intellectual 
property, &mdash; that is to say, the right of men to own and control the 
creations of their minds, not less than the work of their hands.  To 
this it is objected that there can be no such thing as property in 
ideas, &mdash; that the notion is an absurdity, and the attempt to enforce 
the alleged right a restriction of common rights.  Others say that 
a patent is nothing less than a monopoly, and monopolies are a relic 
of barbarism, justly odious to all civilized men; that 
letters-patent are no better than letters of marque, to allow the 
holder to prey upon honest industry, and that not the industry of 
enemies and foreigners, but of his own countrymen.  It is further 
objected that patents increase the price of commodities; that by 
encouraging the invention of labor-doing or labor-saving inventions, 
they take from the artisan his only means of earning a living, and 
by lessening the demand for skilled labor and individual 
intelligence they tend to sink the man in the machine; that a patent 
allows one man to step in and say that other men shall not carry on 
their business in the best way; that by patenting an invention we 
practically tie up the idea involved and stop the whole course of 
thought in that direction, thereby interfering injuriously with 
intellectual activity; that by the conventional reward which patents 
offer we give an unnatural impulse to the inventive faculty, and so 
destroy the natural equilibrium of men's capacities, and foster a 
fanciful turn of mind at the expense of thoroughness and a patient 
working out of sound ideas.  The last very comical objection has 
been gravely urged by an Englishman, who, for a horrible example, 
pointed to the United States, where, he said, "the factitious value 
attached to invention has tended to produce an almost total 
sacrifice of solid workmanship to flimsy ingenuity." 
</p><p>The sole object for which patents are granted is the advancement 
of the useful arts, through the making and speedy publishing of 
inventions.  The patent-system seeks to secure this double end, not 
by directly rewarding inventors, but by recognizing their exclusive 
right to the use and profit of their new ideas for a term of years, 
in return for which recognition each inventor makes public an 
explicit description of his invention or discovery.  The opponents 
of the system assert that it is no part of the duty of the state to 
advance the arts; that inventors do not need to be encouraged in 
this or any other artificial way; that patents do not encourage 
inventors either to make or to publish their inventions; that 
patents destroy natural competition in the arts, and thus tend to 
weaken the natural impulse of men to make improvements; that patents 
do not reward inventors uniformly or in proportion to their merits; 
that they throw difficulties in the way of invention, and so hinder 
and annoy inventors; and contrarily, that they lead to an excessive 
development of the faculty of invention, and impel men to waste 
their time in profitless experiments.  But the saddest of all the 
objections we have met was that of an eloquent and sympathetic 
Frenchman, who complained that patents give undue advantage to their 
possessors, "making a golden bridge for him who enters the arena 
with arms more subtle and more finely tempered than those of his 
adversaries."  This reminds us of the tender-hearted boy that wept 
over the Bible picture for fear that there would not be enough of 
Daniel to go around. 
</p><p>It is still further urged against the patent-system that, 
through its action, we discriminate against native industries and 
play into the hands of foreign manufacturers; for, having no 
inventors' royalties or license fees to pay, they can sell so much 
the cheaper, and thus command markets that otherwise might be ours; 
also, that many large users of patented inventions &mdash; railway 
companies, for example &mdash; find it unprofitable to do without, and very 
burdensome to pay for, the inventions they need; and that, while the 
infringement of patent-rights is apt to be expensive, it is a great 
trouble to manufacturers and others to keep track of the operations 
of the patent-office so as to know whether the devices they want to 
use are patented or not.  Finally, it is claimed that patents are 
inconsistent with the spirit of the age; that some of the leading 
statesmen and savants of Europe have declared against the policy of 
issuing patents, and that in Switzerland the utmost freedom of trade 
in ideas &mdash; the unrestricted seizure of the inventions of all nations 
without payment  
<pb n="101"/>  
therefor &mdash; has been a winning game for the 
masters and artisans of that thrifty little state. 
</p><p>In view of all this, does it not seem a little remarkable, to 
say the least, that, with our extremely liberal patent-system and 
two hundred thousand patents in force, we should have any industries 
at all? 
</p><p>Happily, many of these plausible objections are mutually 
destructive, and we may be sure that the rest will appear less 
formidable when tested by the logic of fact; for this reason, if for 
no other: that the industrial progress of modern times has been 
coincident with inventions, and inventions have coincided 
geographically with patent-laws; still more, they have been locally 
numerous or the reverse in proportion to the liberality of those 
laws. 
</p><p>Assuming &mdash; with all proper deference to the pope, the Turk, and 
the socialist &mdash; that our modern civilization is in the main a good 
thing; and admitting that inventions rank among the chief factors of 
our civilization, at least in its material aspects, we must further 
admit that they are in their grand results, if not in all their 
details, good and worthy of being encouraged.  And, as a matter of 
common honesty, we must also admit that, if inventors have any 
property rights in the fruits of their genius and toil, such rights 
ought to be respected.  Whether the patent-system provides a proper 
and sufficient method for encouraging invention and protecting 
inventors' rights, can be determined only by a study of the 
threefold influence of patents on invention, on industrial progress, 
and on public prosperity. 
</p><p>Accordingly, let us inquire how patents affect inventors; how 
they affect large users of patented appliances and processes, as, 
for example, farmers and manufacturers; how they affect the laboring 
classes; finally, how they affect social conditions generally, by 
changing the scope and cost of the necessaries, conveniences, and 
luxuries of life.  If space permits, a few words may be added with 
regard to the advantages of a patent-system that favors every grade 
of inventors, as the American system does, by its accessibility, 
cheapness, and liberality. 
</p><p>It may not be amiss to say here that a patent is nothing more 
than an official certificate that the patentee claims to be the 
inventor of some thing or process that is new and useful, and that, 
with the evidence in the possession of the patent-office, there is 
good reason to believe the claim to be a just one.  In no sense is 
the patent a reward for invention, nor is the patent-system in any 
way to blame if the inventor derives no benefit from his invention.  
The patent-office merely registers and publishes the claim; the 
courts must confirm its validity, in case the claim is disputed.  In 
the vast majority of cases, the presumptive right of the patentee to 
the absolute control of his invention for the specified term of 
years, goes unchallenged.  Does the patent create that right?  So 
the opponents of the patent-system assert; but the truth is quite 
the contrary.  The right exists by virtue of the inventor's act of 
creation.  The patent defines the nature and scope of the ideal 
property, and at the same time limits the period of its exclusive 
enjoyment.  It is a case of give and take, in which the chief 
concession is made by the inventor.  The time will come when 
patent-rights will be limited only by the natural life of 
inventions, &mdash; which is shorter than most people imagine, &mdash; just as 
other property rights are; but for the present the status of 
intellectual property is so insecure that great concessions have to 
be made by the owners of such property to popular-barbarism. 
</p><p>In respect to the rights of intellectual property, public 
opinion is, in fact, not much above the level of the socialistic 
plane in respect to material property; and many a man, who realizes 
keenly enough the iniquity of the chicken-thief or pickpocket, is 
quite unconscious of any wrong in the infringement of an inventor's 
or an author's rights.  Indeed, very few seem to be aware that, as 
Professor Shaler has pointed 
out,<ref target="RicPate1">*</ref>  "When we come to weigh the 
rights of the several sorts of property which can be held by man, 
and in this judgment take only the absolute questions of justice, 
leaving out the limitations of expediency and prejudice, it will be 
clearly seen that intellectual property is, after all, the only 
absolute possession in the world.  The man who brings out of 
nothingness some child of his thought, has rights therein which 
cannot belong to any other sort of property."  Nor are many aware 
that, as the same writer shows in another connection, when we 
consider the circumstances connected with the origin of the title to 
intellectual property through letters-patent, and compare it with 
those other property rights which are commonly considered the more 
real, the proof is convincing that the element of newness is the 
most noticeable feature concerning its history, and that in its 
origin it is essentially like the other property rights.

<pb n="102"/>  
Said Judge Storrow, before the Congressional committee on 
patents last winter: 
</p><p>"I look upon it as a mark of the highest civilization that a 
country shall recognize by its fundamental law, the utilitarian 
effects of pure brain-power; as a mark both of the highest 
civilization, and of the highest reaches of the law that a nation 
recognizes as property to be protected, because helpful to the state 
and to all its people, the pure creations of the intellect; a 
species of property not inherent in or attached to any particular 
portion of matter, but which depends for its recognition on the 
appreciative intellect of the community, and for its 
protection &mdash; that is, for its existence as property &mdash; upon the 
national deference for law and order." 
</p><p>The monopoly which an inventor enjoys under a patent bears no 
comparison to those monopolies of privilege by which semi-civilized 
rulers reward their favorites.  The inventor's monopoly infringes no 
man's rights; it diminishes in no wise the world's stock of common 
possessions; it simply recognizes the patentee's exclusive right to 
control something which he has discovered or created; something 
which the world had not before him, and might never have had except 
for him. 
</p><p>To compare letters-patent to letters of marque is equally unfair 
and unjust.  The idea of a patentee preying upon industry is 
grotesque in its absurdity.  He cannot take to himself a single 
thing or process that the world has previously enjoyed; nor can he 
restrain any one from doing precisely as he has always done, if he 
prefers the old way.  True the new way may make the old 
unprofitable; and that is where invention always hurts.  In all 
progress somebody comes out behind.  Shall we therefore worship 
immobility, Chinese-fashion? 
</p><p>Very often the first visible effect of an invention is the 
practical destruction of interests involving much of capital, and 
employing many laborers.  Of this sort was the invention of 
artificial substitutes for vegetable dyes, like madder; in which 
case an industry almost national in magnitude had to be given up; 
yet the conversion of the madder-growing lands to food-producing 
areas proved advantageous, not merely to the world at large but also 
to the immediate tillers of them.  The whaling industry was all but 
destroyed by the inventions which raised petroleum from 
insignificance to one of our most valuable resources.  Sooner or 
later the manufacture of gas for illuminating purposes will receive 
its death-blow from inventions perfecting the electric light.  And 
think what a crushing blow would be given to the greatest 
manufacturing interest in existence, should some one succeed in 
producing aluminium at the present cost of iron; or to the 
coal-mining interest, should there be devised an economical method 
of utilizing the enormous power of the tides, or the solar forces 
now squandered upon tropical deserts!  Yet who would seriously argue 
that the ultimate effects of such inventions would not be enormously 
advantageous to the race?  Or who would expect the owners of 
superseded establishments to submit cheerfully to the new order of 
things? 
</p><p>At a time like the present, when inventors are so numerous, so 
active and so fertile, it is not at all surprising that there should 
be many who feel that, after all our boasting about 
nineteenth-century progress, we may have rather too much of it.  Nor 
is it surprising that in many cases the strongest opposition to 
inventors' rights should come from men who have reaped large 
benefits from the patent-law.  The moment an inventor ceases to 
invent and becomes a manufacturer and merchant, that moment, if he 
is a self-seeker only, his opinion of the patent-system may undergo 
a radical change.  The moment the owner of a profitable patent is 
confronted by a man with a better invention which he cannot get 
control of, he is apt to become a little dubious.  So long as the 
system conserved his interests, he could look upon it as a good 
thing; but he is not so sure of it when it permits another to entice 
away his customers.  However, in justice to our inventors and 
manufacturers, it must be said that opposition to the patent-system 
very rarely comes from them.  That ungrateful work is almost 
entirely monopolized by the railway companies, or rather a few of 
them.  Forgetting the important circumstance that it is to inventors 
that they owe their daily successes not less than their original 
existence, they foolishly think that they can succeed indefinitely 
without them; at any rate they adopt the course best calculated to 
drive invention into other channels; and not satisfied with boldly 
invading inventors' rights, they have the assurance to appeal to 
Congress for an amendment of the patent-law, which shall put 
inventors completely under their thumbs.  Foremost in this effort 
has been the Western Railway Association, the temper of which is 
fairly illustrated by the cool avowal of one of its prominent 
members, that "whenever our attention is called to a patent of 
 
<pb n="103"/>  
value, we use it, and in a few cases we are made to pay by 
plucky inventors; but in the aggregate we pay much less than if we 
took licenses at first." 
</p><p>In course of time the moral development of the community at 
large will rise to such a level that it will not be prudent for any 
man or set of men to undertake to carry out so boldly 
</p><p>                    "the good old plan, 
</p><p>        That they shall take who have the power, 
</p><p>                And they shall keep who can!" 
 
As yet, however, even in the most enlightened countries, the rights 
of intellectual property are but feebly respected.  "The great 
protection of property," says judge Storrow, "the strong arm of the 
law, the power of the police and the criminal courts, the right of 
every man to defend his own by force, is utterly denied to the 
patentee in this country.  For one who steals the machine of the 
infringer, there is the summary arrest and the prison; but for the 
infringer who has wantonly stolen my invention, there is no 
policeman, no prosecution at government expense, no terror of 
punishment."  The wronged patentee may sue for loss or damages, but 
that is a slow and often fruitless process, particularly if the 
defendant has money and the plaintiff none. 
</p><p>The assertion that the patent-system interferes injuriously with 
intellectual progress by blocking the course of thought is curiously 
at variance with the evidence of history.  As soon as a patent is 
granted, the invention is made public and the new idea passes into 
the mental capital of thinking men.  The better the idea, the sooner 
it bears fruit.  At once a score or more of ingenious men say, "Here 
is a good thing;" and straightway they set to work to develop the 
idea, to apply it in new ways, or to compass the same or a similar 
end in a different way.  Hence the swarms of kindred inventions that 
follow every important excursion from the beaten line of thought.  
Generic inventions are particularly prolific in after patents; 
witness the steam-engine, the telegraph, the sewing-machine, the 
telephone.  So far from blocking the course of thought in their 
direction, such patents open flood-gates of useful invention.  What 
miracles of previously undreamed-of invention have been called out 
by the telephone within a year!  What worlds of unexplored fact and 
thought have thereby been laid open for scientific investigation! 
</p><p>The assertion that patents over-stimulate invention, to the 
destruction of honest and solid workmanship, is simply preposterous.  
When that charge was made, the Centennial Exhibition had not opened 
the eyes of the world to the real condition of the industrial arts 
in America; and English readers were less familiar with our "flimsy 
inventions" than now, when American products have invaded every 
market in Europe, to the consternation of local producers.  One of 
the Swiss commissioners, a large manufacturer, wrote as follows:  
"For several years the Americans have set themselves to work to 
equal and outstrip Europe.   
They have not failed.  The world 
has never seen so considerable a sum of new ideas and of 
applications of those new ideas as was presented by the exposition 
at Philadelphia."  In another connection, after saying that if a 
Swiss manufacturer wished to contend only against competition, he 
was obliged to bring his machinery from America, he asked:  "Who 
does not know American sewing-machines? and who has not already 
become satisfied that even when machines of the same kind are made 
in Europe in enormous quantities, the somewhat higher price of the 
American machines is largely compensated for by their construction, 
their solidity, and their convenience?  Have you ever compared a 
rake, a knife, a hatchet, made in America with tools made here?  How 
much is Europe left behind!  I do not speak of special articles of 
which many are not known to us.  While our makers aim generally at 
products heavy, massive, solid in appearance, and save rather in the 
quality of the metal than on the weight, American workmanship is 
light, pleasing to the eye, and almost always employs good 
material."  A little further on, the same critical observer sums up 
the characteristics of American manufactures in the five 
words, &mdash; handsome, solid, practical, light, and good.  That American 
inventiveness has not injured the quality of American workmanship, 
is equally evident in many other departments of production.  Witness 
the favor with which European and other foreign markets have 
received our leather and leather goods, watches, light hardware, 
carpenters' and other artisans' tools, saws, agricultural implements 
and machinery, cheese, canned goods, carriages and carriage 
materials, railway and tram-way cars, locomotive engines, chilled 
rollers for sheet metal, rubber and paper making, wood and leather 
working machinery, paper and paper-hangings, tinware, toys, hard 
rubber goods, sewing and knitting machines, and a long list of less 
important articles, the superior quality of  
<pb n="104"/>  
which enables them 
to compete with European products, even when to their higher cost is 
added a heavy percentage for transportation. 
</p><p>Whether or not it is the duty of the state to encourage the 
industrial arts, it is superfluous to argue; it pays to do so, and 
that is enough.  Besides, if civilization is worth having, it is 
worth perfecting by all legitimate means.  But, say the objectors, 
inventors do not need to be encouraged, and, if they did, patents 
would not be a proper means for reaching the desired end.  Inventors 
do not say so; on the contrary, their testimony is uniformly in 
favor of the patent-system.  Not that the system as developed in 
this country or anywhere else is perfect; no one claims that; but it 
is infinitely better than any substitute for it that has ever been 
proposed.  Imperfect as patent-laws have been in many of their 
details, they have offered to inventors a degree of protection 
without which, they tell us, they would rarely have had the heart, 
even had they felt the inclination, to devote to their ideas the 
time and money required to put them into practical working order.  
Very often the profits of one unimportant patent has put into the 
hands of an inventor the money required to work out an invention 
which has marked an era in the world's industrial progress.  Such 
was the case of Bigelow, of the carpet loom; and with Lyall, the 
inventor of the positive-motion loom.  The greatest of all our 
recent inventors, Edison, furnishes another illustration.  His 
patents are his capital, and they bring in the money required to 
keep up the costly laboratory at Menlo Park.  Patting the 
phonograph, when it was the latest offspring of his brain, he said, 
"This is the boy that is to take care of his father in his old age!" 
</p><p>No one can study the lives of Watt and Stephenson, Fulton, Wood, 
Whitney, Nott, Colt, Howe, Blanchard, Goodyear, Morse, McCormick, 
and the thousand other inventors who have given to our modern 
civilization its character, without being impressed by the fact that 
the protection offered by patent-laws has been, if not their 
greatest incentive to invent, at least an essential condition of 
their devoting their lives to this beneficent work.  And though many 
inventors have been grievously wronged by unscrupulous infringers, 
while the public which owed so much to them looked on with 
indifference or applauded the robbery, yet it is to be doubted 
whether a single inventor could be found who would have the 
patent-system abolished.  The gross injustice done to inventors, as 
in Whitney's case, is to be charged to corrupt courts and an 
undeveloped moral sense on the part of the community, and not to any 
radical defect in the patent-system.  Even material property is not 
yet entirely secure against invasion among us. 
</p><p>The substitution of specific rewards for invention, as proposed 
by the grangers and a few others, finds favor with no one who has 
fairly investigated the conditions of the case.  In the first place, 
it is no part of the duty of the state to reward inventors; but it 
is the duty of the state to protect the rights of all its members, 
inventors not less than others.  The recognition of their rights is 
a matter of justice, not an act of charity.  Again, admitting that 
inventors would be willing to surrender their rights for a cash 
payment, it would require something like official omniscience to 
determine, in any case, the just equivalent for an invention, and 
that is hardly to be expected.  But granting that, there would still 
remain an insuperable objection to the plan, in the lack of any 
provision for the industrial development of inventions.  Usually the 
inventor's task has barely begun when his invention is apparently 
completed; the hardest part is to introduce it and make it a 
financial success.  For this, much time and labor and ready cash are 
demanded; and who would be willing to meet the demand, if, when all 
was done, any one could step in and reap all the profit, without 
trouble or risk? 
</p><p>Here comes in the advantage of the patent-law to manufacturers.  
To produce cheaply usually requires an expensive plant, and 
generally a long series of preliminary experiments, and it would be 
downright folly to sink capital in that way in the absence of the 
protection which patents afford.  The charge that patents destroy 
natural competition and so arrest the desire for improvements is 
refuted by all experience.  It is in this country, where patents are 
numerous and easily obtained, that improved machines and processes 
are most rapidly introduced, as in textile manufactures, in 
watch-making, and shoe-making; and not in Switzerland, where until 
recently no patents have been granted, or in England and Germany, 
where patents have been hard to get.  In the agitation of this 
question in Switzerland, after the Centennial Exhibition had 
revealed to the manufacturers of that country the secret of their 
failing trade, the prominent manufacturer, Edward Dubied, said: 
</p><p>"Messrs. Favre-Perret, Bally, and David,  
<pb n="105"/>  
our commissioners 
to the Philadelphia Exhibition, call for a patent-law in 
Switzerland, as a means for perfecting our industries.  The author 
of these lines regards the institution of patents as the first and 
indispensable measure, without which any other will be utterly 
useless, for reaching the end we all have in view.  If he especially 
insists on this point, it is because he has the advantage over the 
gentlemen he has named, of spending twenty-five years as engineer 
and machine-builder in a patent-granting country, &mdash; namely, 
France, &mdash; before he established himself as manufacturer in 
Switzerland.  He can, therefore, bring his own experience to the 
support of their demand, and he assures his fellow-citizens that a 
law for the protection of property in inventions would be a true 
magician's wand among us, completely transforming our system of 
manufactures, and raising us in a short time, in a natural manner 
and with less effort than we should expect, to a level with the 
nations most advanced in the arts." 
</p><p>Some six or eight years ago a strenuous effort was made in 
England to secure a radical change in, or the abolition of, the 
English patent-law.  The Parliamentary committee had before them a 
large number of inventors, manufacturers and others, and collected 
nearly 500 closely printed quarto pages of testimony.  In the final 
report of the committee, it was set down as established by the 
inquiry that the privilege conferred by the grant of letters-patent 
promotes the progress of manufactures, by causing many important 
inventions to be introduced and developed more rapidly than would 
otherwise be the case; that the same privilege leads to the 
introduction and publication of numerous improvements, each of minor 
character, but the sum of which contributes greatly to the progress 
of industry; and that it does not appear that the granting of 
pecuniary rewards could be substituted, with advantage to the public 
interest, for the temporary privilege conferred by letters-patent. 
</p><p>The experience of the British colonies adds practical 
demonstration of these truths.  The colonies of the southern 
hemisphere began with what is called free trade in ideas; but it 
proved a losing game.  A patent-law had to be adopted, because, as 
its proposers said, they could not get inventions without a 
patent-system, and without inventions no rapid development of their 
industries was possible.  Canada tried a shrewder plan, and gave 
patents to native inventors, but denied them to outsiders.  It was 
thought that Canadian manufacturers would gain by exemption from the 
charges of Yankee inventors, and would yet have all the advantage of 
their improvements.  But the plan worked badly; Yankee inventions 
were free to all, and for that very reason no one dared to put his 
money into them.  The law was changed; the rights of all inventors 
were respected; and now the manufacturing industries of Canada are 
progressing wonderfully. 
</p><p>From the replies received to a letter of inquiry widely 
circulated by our Department of State a few years ago, it appeared 
that from three-fourths to nine-tenths of the capital invested in 
manufacturing establishments in this country had been attracted by 
the protection offered by patents.  And the progress of our 
manufactures has been exactly coincident with the activity of our 
inventors.  In 1850, the products of our mechanical industries were 
valued at  $100,000,000.  In 1860 they amounted to $11,800,000,000.  
By 1870 they had increased to $4,200,000,000; and, in spite of 
financial disturbances, the census of 1880 will show an increase not 
less remarkable.  The number of patents issued furnishes a safe 
basis for this prediction.  About 1850 they averaged less than 1,000 
a year.  In 1860 they bad risen to 3,000 a year.  In 1870 they had 
jumped to over 7,000; and now they exceed 16,000 a year.  The 
progress of manufactures westward coincides with the geographical 
distribution of the patentees.  In 1850 the mechanical industries of 
the six great western states produced considerably less than half as 
much as those of New England.  In 1871 they were nearly equal; 
to-day they are unquestionably far ahead. 
</p><p>We are apt to think of our country as primarily an agricultural 
country; we do, indeed, excel all other lands in that direction, 
thanks chiefly to our inventors; yet the value of the products 
turned out by our manufacturing establishments last year was very 
nearly double that of our agricultural products.  Even the states 
which are above all others agricultural in character &mdash; the states 
next north of the Ohio River &mdash; are remarkable rather for the 
magnitude of their manufacturing interests.  As long ago as 1870, as 
maybe seen by the census statistics of that year, the manufactured 
products of the seven leading agricultural states &mdash; Ohio, Indiana, 
Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa and Missouri &mdash; exceeded in value 
their agricultural products.  And the development of mechanical 
industries in those states has been amazingly rapid since that date.  
 
<pb n="106"/>  
In Ohio, for instance, the manufactured products in 1870 
reached the enormous sum of $269,713,000; in 1875 they were worth 
$400,000,000.  Will anybody be so foolish as to say that the 
agricultural interests of Ohio were not directly advanced by her 
growth in mechanical industries, &mdash; by the home markets for farm 
products created by the thousands of artisans added to the ranks of 
consumers? 
</p><p>There remains to be considered the influence of the 
patent-system upon the working classes, and upon the community at 
large.  How do inventions affect the laborer?  Take the case at its 
worst, where the substitution of machinery for muscle has been most 
rapid &mdash; as in agriculture, textile manufactures, shoe-making, sewing, 
and so on.  The logic of uncritical thinkers on this point runs 
somewhat in this wise:  Before the introduction of machinery, or of 
improved machinery, so many hands turned out so much work.  Now, the 
annual product is ten times as great.  Therefore there ought to be 
ten times as many hands employed.  But there are only twice as many.  
Behold what a deadly blow machinery has given to labor!  It never 
occurs to such distressed labor-lovers to ask where the extra hands 
they say should now be employed could have come from.  In every 
instance where an industry has been modified by the introduction of 
machinery, the demand for labor has been increased beyond anything 
that could have been possible without machinery.  Machinery reduces 
cost; cheapness multiplies consumers; to supply the widened market 
a larger annual product is necessary; then comes an increased demand 
for labor.  That is the universal rule.  In most cases a thousand 
years of machineless progress would not suffice to provide for 
hand-labor the employment which machine-fearing critics falsely 
assume to have been taken away by machinery from &mdash; operatives unborn! 
</p><p>In estimating the influence of machinery upon farm-labor, it 
will not do to calculate the number of men it would take to sow by 
hand and reap with a sickle the millions of bushels of wheat and 
other grain the country produced last year, and then say that the 
excess over the number actually employed was so many men shut out 
from farm-work by patent seeders and reaping-machines.  It is to 
machinery that we owe the possibility of any grain crops at all 
throughout the larger part of the grain-producing 
interior, &mdash; certainly any crop that would bear transportation to 
market.  Without machinery for saving time and labor, for doing work 
that man's unaided hands could never compass, nine-tenths of our 
broad land would still be a wilderness.  And as with agriculture, so 
with all our industries; they could have but a feeble existence, or 
none, in the absence of the inventions that have given them life and 
character. 
</p><p>How much of the wealth and prosperity of our country, north and 
south, has been based on cotton!  Yet how few realize the 
indebtedness of the cotton interests to two inventors &mdash; Lowell and 
Whitney.  The one created a demand for American cotton, the other 
made it possible to meet that demand.  Arkwright's machinery could 
do nothing with the American staple, and only an insignificant 
quantity was called for by the hand-spinners.  Not until Lowell's 
machinery was set up here and subsequently in England did the 
American staple become an article of commerce.  When Whitney 
invented his gin for separating cottonseed from the fiber, 
eighty-five years ago, four pounds of cleaned cotton was accounted 
a day's work for a man.  With Whitney's first machine a man could 
clean seventy pounds.  To-day the perfected cotton-gin will do that 
work in ten minutes!  Fifteen hundred thousand men, working all the 
year, could not have cleaned by hand our last year's crop.  At what 
rate of wages could they have done the work and left a margin of 
cost which would allow the product to be transported to New 
Hampshire, and converted into cloth to be sold at from three to four 
cents a yard?  It is estimated that 200,000,000 people are now 
reached by machine-made cottons.  Three times as many more remain to 
be reached, the only barrier being the cost of production.  The 
invention of a cotton-picking machine would effect a large part of 
the required reduction in cost.  Will any one say that the amount of 
labor employed upon cotton would be diminished in this country, if 
a cotton-picking machine should displace ninety-nine out of every 
hundred cotton pickers now employed?  The increased demand for 
cotton, owing to the diminished cost, would give them plenty to do, 
even in the cotton-field in picking-time. 
</p><p>It is not denied that the introduction of machinery into an 
established industry often seriously affects the laborer.  To those 
who are able and willing to adjust themselves to the new conditions, 
the change is almost invariably beneficial.   
<pb n="107"/>  
Those who cannot, 
or will not, fare hard.  Sometimes an invention wipes out a 
previously profitable industry; the only thing its followers can do 
under such circumstances is to try something else.  Art is but 
little less merciless than nature; and with every step forward in 
civilization, the harder becomes the lot of those who lag behind.  
We have seen how inventions of the highest utility to the race may 
bear very heavily on moneyed interests for a time.  It is equally so 
with labor interests.  Take the supposed case of cheap aluminium.  
It would necessitate not only a large re-adjustment of capital, but 
a radical change of occupation on the part of thousands of more or 
less skilled workers in iron.  Should any large body of them say, as 
they would be likely to:  "We belong to the iron-founders' union; 
our business is to make iron; we wont have anything to do with your 
newfangled metal, and we will destroy every clay-bank foundry you 
dare to put up," is it not certain that sooner or later they would 
go to the wall severely, &mdash; and deserve to? 
</p><p>The complaint that machinery robs the laborer of his only 
capital is entirely unfounded.  Machinery never lessened the amount 
of work to be done, though it has constantly changed the character 
of the work.  The labor-saving machinery employed in agriculture is 
almost entirely the product of the inventions of the past thirty 
years.  In no part of the world has the introduction of such 
machinery been more general or more rapid than in the grain-growing 
states of the West.  The result is shown in the census reports.  
During the ten years ending in 1860, the farm hands of those states 
increased in number more than fifty per cent.  During the next ten, 
in spite of the losses of the war, the increase was about thirty per 
cent.  During the same twenty years, the population of the country 
as a whole increased only sixty-seven per cent. 
</p><p>When Walter Hunt invented his sewing-machine in 1838, his wife 
protested that it would throw all the sewing women out of 
employment, and persuaded him to suppress it.  Howe's and Singer's 
and no end of other machines have come since then, and yet there is 
work for women to do.  Notwithstanding the thousands of family 
machines in use, the number of persons earning a living with the 
sewing-machine in this country is to-day much greater in proportion 
to the population than was the number of tailors and sewing women 
before the invention of the machine, which a recent pretended 
labor-lover has classed with the steam-engine as one of the two 
worst evils that ever befell mankind.  In noting its influence upon 
labor, we must not forget the 20,000 or more mechanics employed in 
our sewing-machine factories, and the thousands of others engaged in 
mining and making the iron, cutting and sawing the lumber, and in 
transporting and preparing these raw materials for the machines and 
their cases; nor the men employed in making the machinery used in 
the construction of sewing-machines, and in transporting and selling 
the finished product.  Counting these, the invention appears in its 
true light as a great creator of labor; and the average wages of the 
persons directly or indirectly employed by the sewing-machine is 
doubtless four or five times that of the old-time sewers. 
</p><p>It is but a little while since a metropolitan paper of high rank 
pointed to the shoe business as furnishing a forcible illustration 
of the disastrous competition of machinery with men.  The truth is 
that while within twenty years, not less than eighty-five per cent. 
of the work done on factory boots and shoes has been turned over to 
machinery, there are to-day more men at work in shoe-factories than 
then, and more than would now be employed except for machinery.  It 
is but another illustration of the old industrial paradox.  During 
these years of rapid progress in invention, the cost of materials 
has advanced, wages have nearly doubled, and the quality of factory 
boots and shoes has been improved twenty-five per cent.; yet the 
cost of manufacture has been so much reduced by new and improved 
machinery that American shoes have not only excluded the 
foreign-made from our market, but have successfully invaded the 
markets of the whole world.  As a natural consequence, many more 
shops are required not only in New England, but throughout the 
middle states and the West; more workmen are employed in 
shoe-factories; higher wages are paid; and a great multitude of 
other men are furnished with employment in tanning the additional 
leather used, in packing and transporting and selling the additional 
product, and in making shoe-makers' machinery and implements. 
</p><p>One of the prime conditions of our being able to manufacture for 
ourselves, let alone the outside world, is the improvement of 
mechanical processes due to our inventors.  At least four-fifths of 
the industries of the country have been made possible by such means.  
Thirty-five years ago all carpets  
<pb n="108"/>  
were made by hand, and there 
was no labor so ill-paid in this country as to make carpet-weaving 
profitable among us; to-day our production of carpets is larger than 
that of any other nation.  Then it took a man and a helper all day 
to make seven yards of Brussels carpet; now a girl tending an 
American loom will weave fifty yards in a day.  Machinery does what 
hands could not; and so we owe to it an industry that yields over 
thirty million dollars' worth of useful and ornamental products a 
year; keeps at home many millions that formerly went abroad; and 
furnishes profitable employment to hundreds of native operatives. 
</p><p>Then think of the many labor-creating inventions, and the novel 
industries founded on them, &mdash; the printing press, the telegraph, the 
photograph, hard rubber, vulcanized fiber, artificial stone, 
building paper, electroplating, the sand-blast, and a thousand other 
operations and products, which in the aggregate add enormously to 
the demand for labor.  "New England has invested a great deal of 
capital in her leading manufactures," said a prominent eastern man, 
not long since; "yet her real strength lies in the numerous small 
things in which she stands unequaled.  So many things are required 
in our civilization, that the absence of the very smallest of these 
`Yankee notions' would be missed by thousands, both here and 
abroad."  And by none would they be more missed than by the 
thousands of skilled artisans to whom they furnish steady and 
profitable employment.  These Yankee notions are invariably 
patented; and they are an especial product of the American system.  
In Europe the same inventions could scarcely be patented; and, 
lacking the protection which a patent affords, they would never be 
largely or cheaply produced or generally adopted. 
</p><p>To the common assertion that machinery lessens wages and 
subordinates mind and muscle to brute matter, the proper reply is, 
where is the proof?  It is only in machine-using countries that 
labor is at all well paid, and the pay is best where machinery is 
most used.  The reports of our United States consuls may be studied 
with profit in this connection.  A comparison of the wages paid 
to-day in our home industries of every sort, compared with those 
paid before machinery was introduced, and the purchasing power of 
such wages, will be equally instructive. 
</p><p>The complaint that machinery lessens the dignity and worth of 
industrial manhood has been conclusively answered by Professor 
Shaler.  Says the Swiss centennial commissioner, Bally, in his 
pamphlet "Look out for yourselves," addressed to his 
fellow-manufacturers:  "I am satisfied from my knowledge that no 
people has made in so short a time so many useful inventions as the 
Americans; and if to-day machinery apparently does all the work, it 
by no means reduces the workman to a machine.  He uses it as a 
machine, it is true, but he is always thinking about some 
improvement to introduce into it; and often his thoughts lead to 
fine inventions or useful improvements." 
</p><p>In an appendix to the same pamphlet, after noting several lines 
of production in which American competition has become a serious 
matter to European manufacturers, and showing that in intelligence 
and productive capacity the Swiss workman compares with the American 
as one to four.  M. Dubied says:  "Our readers are perhaps 
astonished that we insist upon a patent-system as of the first 
necessity; but we shall justify this by showing that the protection 
of property in inventions develops the desire for technical 
instruction; while the absence of such legal protection is nothing 
less than a premium given to ignorance to the detriment of inventive 
talent." 
</p><p>Some years ago the writer described our Patent-Office as an 
industrial university of the best sort, doing true university work 
in examining and certifying the results of practical study.  He has 
seen no reason for changing the opinion.  No student ever prized a 
degree more highly than our mechanics do a patent; and the granting 
of a thousand or fifteen hundred patents a month means that no small 
portion of our industrial population are hard at work exploring "the 
untried possibilities of nature," as Professor Shaler happily 
expresses it.  "So long as we can have this sort of training applied 
each year in larger and larger share to our trade life," he says, 
"we may feel the more hopeful of the educational influences at work 
in that part of society, we have therein something that gives in 
large part the character of results attained in scientific training 
of a high grade, as well as the general results which are attained 
by all well-directed training, &mdash; the habit of, and desire for, 
continuous, absorbing mental labor." 
</p><p>We have studied the patent-system with reference to the 
inventor, the manufacturer and farmer, and the laborer; and have 
found it, in the main, of vast and positive advantage to each.  How 
does it affect society and social conditions generally? 
 
<pb n="109"/>  
 
</p><p>Our answer would be: by extending the scope and capacity of 
life; by multiplying the comforts and conveniences of living; by 
cheapening and improving the necessities and attainable luxuries of 
all classes.  It is invention, more than any other social factor, 
that makes it possible to say, &mdash;  
 
</p><p>"Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay!" 
 
</p><p>How often do we hear the remark, such or such a thing is dear, 
because it is patented; when the real state of the case is, that if 
it were not for the patent, the thing would be unattainable at any 
price.  In a speech against the patent-system before the 
Congressional committee already referred to, the attorney of the 
Western Railway Association said:  "Even so simple a thing as a loaf 
of bread pays tribute to twenty-one classes of patents, in each of 
which many patents are now alive, &mdash; the plow-share, point, handles 
and tackle; the harrower, the seed-sower, the cultivator, the 
harvester, the thresher, and the separator; the bag, the holder of 
the bag, and the strap or string with which it is tied; the bolts, 
the hopper, the stones, and the gearing of the mill; the yeast or 
baking-powder, the oven, the extension table, and the dishes, are 
each subject to patents to which tribute is paid." 
</p><p>The inference he would have drawn from all this is, that the 
bread we eat costs more than it ought to by its share of each and 
all the alleged tributes.  But that is arrant nonsense, as no one 
knows better, probably, than the clever advocate himself.  A patent 
cannot touch what already exists except to improve or cheapen it.  
The only way in which it can be of advantage to the holder &mdash; except 
in rare instances where an invention may be suppressed to prevent 
costly changes in the holder's plant or processes &mdash; is by enabling 
him to offer an entirely new and useful article at a price the world 
will pay; an improved article at or below the current price; or a 
standard article below the current price.  Otherwise there is no 
chance for him to compete with what already exists, and his patent 
is pecuniarily worthless.  The possibility of any basis for the 
tribute-taking charge rests entirely on the assumption that the 
progress of invention would be the same in the absence of the 
patent-system, &mdash; an assumption which all experience refutes. 
</p><p>That the cost of our bread is affected by patents is most true; 
but not in the direction Mr. Raymond would have it thought.  Note 
the general effect of two or three of them.  The patented 
improvements in plows are many; those of Nourse in lines of draught, 
now generally adopted by plow-makers, reduced the cost of plowing, 
according to the practical tests of the New York Agricultural 
Society, forty-two percent.  Rating the cost of plowing at one 
dollar an acre, a low figure, this one improvement saves our bread 
producers not less than $50,000,000 a year.  Another improvement, 
the substitution of chilled-iron for cast-steel in the mold-board of 
plows, lessened their cost considerably, and, it is said, doubled 
their durability.  Taking the average life of the 5,000,000 plows in 
use throughout the country at five years, their annual depreciation 
from wear must be between ten and fifteen million dollars; half this 
sum saved in addition to the saving in cost, helps still further to 
cheapen bread.  There have been many improvements in seeders during 
the past twenty years, in which time their price has been reduced 
some fifty per cent.  One of the advantages of these machines is a 
regular placing of the seed at a depth sufficient to prevent 
winter-killing, making a gain, or preventing a loss, of from 
one-eighth to one-fourth of the crop of winter wheat.  The lowest 
figure gives a gain of forty million bushels on a year's crop.  By 
the celerity and cheapness of its work, the combined reaper and 
binder, which the "bread or blood league" object to, has proved its 
capacity to save the country  $100,000,000 on the cost of a single 
years' crop, &mdash; another tribute which our bread not pays to, but is 
relieved from paying by, machinery.  An Ohio farmer, as reported by 
Mr. Coffin, kept exact account of the cost of raising corn for three 
years, when approved double-shovel cultivators were used.  The 
highest cost was twelve cents, and the lowest nine cents a bushel.  
Any one who has hoed corn by hand can estimate the probable saving 
per bushel by the use of machinery, and the aggregate saving on a 
crop of thirteen hundred million bushels.  But that is not what 
attention is specially called to here.  There are cultivators and 
cultivators.  Using an improved machine, the same farmer kept 
account of cost for three more years, during which the highest cost 
was eight and a half cents, and the lowest seven cents a bushel.  
The difference between the use of a good machine and a better, would 
therefore appear to lie somewhere between  $25,000,000 and 
$50,000,000 in the cost of one year's  
<pb n="110"/>  
crop.  Any one who 
desires more abundant evidence on this and related points is 
respectfully referred to the arguments of Mr. Coffin and his 
associates, before the patent committee last winter. (Government 
Printing-Office: Washington, 1878.) 
</p><p>There remains to be noticed briefly the objection to patents 
which most people think they feel severely, and that is that they 
add to the necessary cost of industrial products a certain amount 
known as the inventor's royalty.  Sometimes this is the case; but 
even at its worst the increase of cost is nothing like what is 
currently believed.  On sewing-machines, for example, the royalties 
on all the patents used in a machine would not amount to a quarter 
of the fee of the agent who sold the machine; a charge that was not 
excessive, when we take into account the fact that the seller had 
not only to find his customer and persuade him to buy a machine, but 
also teach him how to use it.  The cost of introducing new 
inventions is, indeed, one of the chief causes of their 
expensiveness compared with standard articles.  This appears very 
strikingly in the case of  agricultural machinery, the salesman's 
fee exceeding the inventor's aggregate royalty many times.  The 
license fees covering all the patents on reapers have rarely 
exceeded $10; on the more expensive automatic binders they have been 
about twice as much, &mdash; not two per cent. of the saving effected by 
their use.  The patents on all the great reaper inventions have run 
out.  Any one is free to make machines like those which were 
considered almost perfect twenty years ago; but no one can afford to 
make them, because no farmer can afford to use them in competition 
with improved machines.  The same is true in many other departments; 
in most textile industries, for example.  Since 1860, there has been 
an entire revolution in cotton manufacturing; and if we may believe 
the testimony of Governor Swan of New Hampshire, himself a great 
manufacturer, machines in use ten years ago are obsolete to-day, and 
are broken up for old iron.  Crompton's fancy-woolen loom marked an 
era in the history of that industry.  In 1850 it threw the shuttle 
fifty times a minute; to-day the shuttle is thrown one hundred and 
eighty times a minute.  The improved loom of 1876 produces sixty per 
cent. more than the loom of 1850, with a saving of fifty per cent. 
in labor, and more than that in repairs; yet Mr. Crompton says that 
as regards capacity the power-loom is still in its infancy.  His pay 
as an inventor would add but a fraction of a cent to the cost of 
each yard of the product of a loom, &mdash; or a small fraction of the 
saving effected by the improvement. 
</p><p>From the inquiries made by our State Department, already 
referred to, it appeared that inventors' royalties would not average 
five per cent. of the cost of patented articles, most estimates 
falling far within this limit.  The aggregate royalties on all the 
machinery used in shoe-factories was given by the representative of 
the Shoe and Leather Association before the patent committee, as 
three and a quarter cents a pair for fine sewed work, and two cents 
for pegged work and a prominent manufacturer assured Mr. Storrow 
that the royalties on all the machines used in the best equipped 
shops were less than would be the rent of the additional room that 
would be required to do the work by hand.  In multitudes of cases, 
where the inventor is also the manufacturer, the advantage of the 
patent lies solely in enabling him to produce a better article than 
his competitors, at or below the current rate. 
</p><p>It is needless to pile up evidence of the value of inventions as 
factors of individual and national prosperity.  They are the 
main-spring of industrial progress, and to a large extent they 
furnish the motive power as well as the means and conditions of our 
modern civilization.  If the world still remains a hard place for 
the incompetent, the thriftless, the uncivilized, it is no worse 
than it always has been, though its contrasts may be greater.  The 
inevitable struggle for existence never has been, nor is ever likely 
to be, very pleasant to those destined to go under.  On the other 
hand, life is on a higher level now than ever before; more can enjoy 
it, and the facilities for, and the scope of, human comfort and 
happiness to-day are infinitely beyond what was possible before the 
age of invention set in. 
</p><p>For a very large share of all that makes life better worth 
living now than a century ago, we are indebted to American 
inventors; and if American inventors are more active and fertile 
than those of any other nation, as all nations admit, it is because 
our patent-system reaches a larger proportion of the population.  It 
is this feature of the system that the thoughtful of other lands 
were quick to appreciate when they saw its effects at our Centennial 
Exhibition, &mdash; the feature which all have promptly imitated in their 
new or amended systems.  Said one of the  
<pb n="111"/>  
commissioners from 
Switzerland, &mdash; which has since substantially adopted, our 
system, &mdash; Many European states have also a patent-system; but as they 
see in it, first of all, a source of revenue to the state, those of 
moderate fortune can hardly obtain a patent.  In Europe the inventor 
anxiously hides his secret from all eyes until he is in possession 
of a patent.  The Americans do not know this uneasiness, for there 
an inventor alone can take a patent, which he afterward has the 
right to sell if he pleases.  Every intelligent man has thus before 
him the possibility of a fortune, often by a very slight 
improvement, and this keeps in ceaseless activity the intelligent 
part of the population." 
</p><p>Said one of the English commissioners, Sir William Thomson:  
"Judged by its results in benefiting the public, both by stimulating 
inventors and by giving a perseveringly practical turn to their 
labors, the American patent-law must be admitted to be most 
successful, and the beneficence of its working was very amply 
illustrated throughout the American region of the Exhibition, where 
indeed it seemed that every good thing deserving a patent was 
patented.  I asked one inventor of a very good invention, `Why do 
you not patent in England?' the reply was, `The conditions in 
England are too onerous.' 
England undoubtedly loses much of 
the benefit which might be had from the inventiveness of Englishmen, 
through the want, in English patent-law, of encouragement and 
protection to inventors unsupported by capitalists." 

</p><p>Stress is laid upon this point here, and upon the merits of our 
patent-system as a whole, that popular attention may be sharply 
called to the general excellence of the system, and the need of 
watchfully guarding it from the attacks of those who mean it harm. 
</p><p>Very few are aware how seriously the integrity of the system was 
assailed in Congress last winter, or how near the assault came to 
success, owing to the ignorance of many members from the West and 
South with regard to its nature, purpose, and influence.  The 
attempt is sure to be repeated; and though the unjust and 
destructive tendency of the more obnoxious amendments proposed was 
well exposed in committee, the work may have to be done over again 
the coming winter.  The subject deserves thorough discussion; and it 
is hoped this paper may be instrumental in provoking such 
discussion.
