NOTE ON KOMACHI 
</head> 
 
<p> 
The legend of Komachi is that she had many lovers when she was young, but 
was cruel and mocked at their pain.  Among them was one, Shii no 
Sho&commacr;shoo&commacr;, who came a long way to court her.  She told him that 
she would not listen to him till he had come on a hundred nights from his 
house to hers and cut a hundred notches on the shaft-bench of his chariot. 
And so he came a hundred nights all but one, through rain, hail, snow, and 
wind.  But on the last night he died. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Once, when she was growing old, the poet Yasuhide asked her to go with him 
to Mikawa.  She answered with the poem:</p> 
 
<q><lg type="poem"> 
<l>I that am lonely,</l> 
<l>Like a reed root-cut</l> 
<l>Should a stream entice me,</l> 
<l>Would go, I think."</l> 
</lg></q> 
 
<p>When she grew quite old, both her friends and her wits forsook her.  She 
wandered about in destitution, a tattered, crazy beggar-woman. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
As shown in this play, her madness was a "possession" by the spirit of the 
lover whom she had tormented.  She was released from this "possession" by 
the virtue of a sacred Stu&commacr;pa 
<ref target="n113.1">[1]</ref> 
 or log carved into five parts, symbolic of the Five Elements, on which 
she sat down to rest. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
In the disputation between Komachi and the priests, she upholds the 
doctrines of the Zen Sect, which uses neither scriptures nor idols; the 
priests defend the doctrines of the Shingon Sect, which promises salvation 
by the use of incantations and the worship of holy images. 
<ref target="n113.2">[2]</ref> 
</p> 
 
<p> 
There is no doubt about the authorship of this play.  Seami 
(<hi rend="italic">Works</hi>, p. 246) gives it as the work of his father, Kwanami 
Kiyotsugu.  Kwanami wrote another play, <hi rend="italic">Shii no 
Sho&commacr;sho&commacr;</hi>, 
<ref target="n113.3">[3]</ref> 
 in which Sho&commacr;sho&commacr; is the principal character and Komachi the 
<hi rend="italic">tsure</hi> or subordinate. 
</p> 
 
<p> 
Seami also used the Komachi legend.  In his <hi rend="italic">Sekidera 
Komachi</hi> he tells how when she was very old the priests of 
<hi rend="italic">Sekidera</hi> invited her to dance at the festival of Tanabata. 
She dances, and in rehearsing the splendours of her youth for a moment 
becomes young again.
