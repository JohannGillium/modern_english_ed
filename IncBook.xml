<lg type="poem">
<l>SOME day of days! Some dawning</l>
<l>    yet to be</l>
<l>I shall be clothed with immortality!</l>
<lb/>

<l>And, in that day, I shall not greatly care
</l><l>That Jane spilt candle grease upon the
</l><l>    stair.</l>
<lb/>

<l>It will not grieve me then, as once it did,
</l><l>That careless hands have chipped my
</l><l>    teapot lid.</l>
<lb/>

<l>I groan, being burdened. But, in that
</l><l>    glad day,
</l><l>I shall forget vexations of the way.</l>
<lb/>

<l>That needs were often great, when means
</l><l>    were small,
</l><l>Will not perplex me any more at all</l>

<pb n="12"/>

<l>A few short years at most (it may be less),
</l><l>I shall have done with earthly storm and
</l><l>    stress.</l>
<lb/>

<l>So, for this day, I lay me at Thy feet.
</l><l>O, keep me sweet, my Master! Keep
</l><l>    me sweet!</l>

<head>Within my House</head>

<lg type="poem">

<l>FIRST, there's the entrance, narrow,
</l><l>    and so small,
</l><l>The hat-stand seems to fill the tiny hall;
</l><l>That staircase, too, has such an awkward
</l><l>    bend,
</l><l>The carpet rucks, and rises up on end!
</l><l>Then, all the rooms are cramped and close
</l><l>    together;
</l><l>And there's a musty smell in rainy weather.
</l><l>Yes, and it makes the daily work go hard
</l><l>To have the only tap across a yard.
</l><l>These creaking doors, these draughts, this
</l><l>    battered paint,
</l><l>Would try, I think, the temper of a saint,</l>

<lb/>

<l>How often had I railed against these
</l><l>    things,
</l><l>With envies, and with bitter murmurings</l>

<pb n="14"/>

<l>For spacious rooms, and sunny garden
</l><l>    plots!
</l><l>Until one day,
</l><l>Washing the breakfast dishes, so I think,
</l><l>I paused a moment in my work to pray;
</l><l>And then and there
</l><l>All life seemed suddenly made new and
</l><l>    fair;
</l><l>For, like the Psalmist's dove among the
</l><l>    pots
</l><l>(Those endless pots, that filled the tiny
</l><l>    sink!),
</l><l>My spirit found her wings.</l>
<lb/>

<l>"Lord" (thus I prayed), "it matters not
</l><l>    at all
</l><l>That my poor home is ill-arranged and
</l><l>    small:
</l><l>I, not the house, am straitened; Lord,
</l><l>    'tis I!
</l><l>Enlarge my foolish heart, that by-and-by
</l><l>I may look up with such a radiant face
</l><l>Thou shalt have glory even in this place.
</l><l>And when I trip, or stumble unawares
</l><l>In carrying water up these awkward stairs.</l>

<pb n="15"/>

<l>Then keep me sweet, and teach me day
</l><l>    by day
</l><l>To tread with patience Thy appointed
</l><l>    way.
</l><l>As for the house . . . . Lord, let it be
</l><l>    my part
</l><l>To walk within it with a perfect heart."</l>

<l>SEE, I am cumbered, Lord,
</l><l>   With serving, and with small vexatious
</l><l>things.
</l><l>Upstairs, and down, my feet
</l><l>Must hasten, sure and fleet.
</l><l>So weary that I cannot heed Thy word;
</l><l>So tired, I cannot now mount up with
</l><l>wings.
</l><l>I wrestle &mdash; how I wrestle! &mdash; through the
</l><l>hours.
</l><l>Nay, not with principalities, nor powers &mdash;
</l><l>Dark spiritual foes of God's and man's &mdash;
</l><l>But with antagonistic pots and pans:
</l><l>With footmarks in the hall,
</l><l>With smears upon the wall,
</l><l>With doubtful ears, and small unwashen
</l><l>hands,
</l><l>And with a babe's innumerable demands.</l>

<pb n="17"/>

<l>I toil with feverish haste, while tear-drops
</l><l>glisten,</l>
<lb/>

<l>(O, child of mine, be still. And listen &mdash;
</l><l>listen!)</l>
<lb/>

<l>At last, I laid aside
</l><l>Important work, no other hands could do
</l><l>So well (I thought), no skill contrive so
</l><l>true.
</l><l>And with my heart's door open &mdash; open
</l><l>wide &mdash;
</l><l>With leisured feet, and idle hands, I sat.
</l><l>I, foolish, fussy, blind as any bat,
</l><l>Sat down to listen, and to learn. And lo,
</l><l>My thousand tasks were done the better so.</l>

<l>I WOULD that you should know,

</l><l>you so!
</l><l>That I remember other days and years;
</l><l>Remember childish joys and childish fears.
</l><l>And this, because my baby's little hand
</l><l>Opened my own heart's door and made
</l><l>me understand.</l>
<lb/>

<l>I wonder how you could</l>
<l>Be always kind and good!
</l><l>So quick to hear; to tend
</l><l>My smallest ills; to lend
</l><l>Such sympathising ears
</l><l>Swifter than ancient seer's.
</l><l>I never yet knew hands so soft and kind,
</l><l>Nor any cheek so smooth, nor any mind
</l><l>So full of tender thoughts. . . . Dear

<pb n="19"/>

<l>I think that I can guess a little how
</l><l>You must have looked for some response,

<l>And sure it was! You were my first dear

</l><l>heard
</l><l>When I came trembling, knocking at your

</l><l>Forgive me, mother, if my whims outwore
</l><l>Your patient heart. Or if in later days
</l><l>I sought out foolish unfamiliar ways;
</l><l>If ever, mother dear, I loosed my hold
</l><l>Of your loved hand; or, headstrong,
</l><l>thought you cold,

<head>In Such an Hour</head>

<lg type="poem">

<l>SOMETIMES, when everything goes
</l><l>wrong:
</l><l>When days are short, and nights are long;
</l><l>When wash-day brings so dull a sky
</l><l>That not a single thing will dry.
</l><l>And when the kitchen chimney smokes,
</l><l>And when there's naught so "queer" as
</l><l>folks!
</l><l>When friends deplore my faded youth,
</l><l>And when the baby cuts a tooth.
</l><l>While John, the baby last but one,
</l><l>Clings round my skirts till day is done;
</l><l>When fat, good-tempered Jane is glum,
</l><l>And butcher's man forgets to come.</l>
<lb/>

<l>Sometimes, I say, on days like these,
</l><l>I get a sudden gleam of bliss.
</l><l>"Not on some sunny day of ease,
</l><l>He'll come . . but on a day like this!"</l>

<pb n="22"/>

<l>And, in the twinkling of an eye,
</l><l>These tiresome things will all go by!</l>
<lb/>

<l>And, 'tis a curious thing, but Jane
</l><l>Is sure, just then, to smile again;
</l><l>Or, out the truant sun will peep,
</l><l>And both the babies fall asleep.
</l><l>The fire burns up with roar sublime,
</l><l>And butcher's man is just in time.
</l><l>And oh! My feeble faith grows strong
</l><l>Sometimes, when everything goes wrong!</l>

<head>The Daily Interview</head>

<lg type="poem">

<l>SUCH a sensation Sundays preacher
</l><l>made.
</l><l>"Christian!" he cried, "what is your stock-</l><l>in-trade?
</l><l>Alas! Too often nil. No time to pray;
</l><l>No interview with Christ from day to day,
</l><l>A hurried prayer, maybe, just gabbled
</l><l>through;
</l><l>A random text &mdash; for any one will do."
</l><l>Then gently, lovingly, with look intense,
</l><l>He leaned towards us &mdash;
</l><l>"Is this common sense?
</l><l>No person in his rightful mind will try
</l><l>To run his business so, lest by-and-by
</l><l>The thing collapses, smirching his good
</l><l>name,
</l><l>And he, insolvent, face the world with
</l><l>shame."</l>

<pb n="24"/>

<l>I heard it all; and something inly said
</l><l>That all was true. The daily toil and press
</l><l>Had crowded out my hopes of holiness.
</l><l>Still, my old self rose, reasoning:
</l><l>How can you,
</l><l>With strenuous work to do &mdash;
</l><l>Real slogging work &mdash; say, how can you
</l><l>keep pace
</l><l>With leisured folks? Why, you could
</l><l>grow in grace
</l><l>If you had time . . . the daily Interview
</l><l>Was never meant for those who wash and
</l><l>bake.</l>
<lb/>

<l>But yet a small Voice whispered:
</l><l>"For My sake
</l><l>Keep tryst with Me!
</l><l>There are so many minutes in a day,
</l><l>So spare Me ten.
</l><l>It shall be proven, then,
</l><l>Ten minutes set apart can well repay
</l><l>You shall accomplish more
</l><l>If you will shut your door
</l><l>For ten short minutes just to watch and
</l><l>pray."</l>

<pb n="25"/>

<l>"Lord, if I do
</l><l>Set ten apart for You"
</l><l>(I dared, yes dared, to reason thus with
</l><l>Him)
</l><l>"The baker's sure to come;
</l><l>Or Jane will call
</l><l>To say some visitor is in the hall;
</l><l>Or I shall smell the porridge burning, yes,
</l><l>And run to stop it in my hastiness.
</l><l>There's not ten minutes, Lord, in all the
</l><l>day
</l><l>I can be sure of peace in which to watch
</l><l>and pray."</l>
<lb/>

<l>But all that night,
</l><l>With calm insistent might,
</l><l>That gentle Voice spake softly, lovingly &mdash;
</l><l>"Keep tryst with Me!
</l><l>You have devised a dozen different ways
</l><l>Of getting easy meals on washing days;
</l><l>You spend much anxious thought on
</l><l>hopeless socks;
</l><l>On moving ironmould from tiny frocks;
</l><l>'Twas you who found
</l><l>A way to make the sugar lumps go round;</l>

<pb n="26"/>

<l>You, who invented ways and means of
</l><l>making
</l><l>Nice spicy buns for tea, hot from the baking,
</l><l>When margarine was short . . . and cannot
</l><l>you
</l><l>Who made the time to join the butter queue
</l><l>Make time again for Me?
</l><l>Yes, will you not, with all your daily
</l><l>striving,
</l><l>Use woman's wit in scheming and contriving
</l><l>To keep that tryst with Me?"</l>
<lb/>

<l>Like ice long bound
</l><l>On powdered frosty ground,
</l><l>My erring will all suddenly gave way.
</l><l>The kind soft wind of His sweet pleading
</l><l>blew,
</l><l>And swiftly, silently, before I knew,
</l><l>The warm love loosed and ran.
</l><l>Life-giving floods began,
</l><l>And so most lovingly I answered Him:
</l><l>"Lord, yes, I will, and can.
</l><l>I will keep tryst with Thee, Lord, come
</l><l>what may!"</l>

<pb n="27"/>

<l><q>ENVOY.</q></l>

<l>  It is a wondrous and surprising thing
</l><l>  How that ten minutes takes the piercing
</l><l>sting
</l><l>  From vexing circumstance and poisonous
</l><l>dart
</l><l>  Hurled by the enemy straight at my
</l><l>heart.
</l><l>  So, to the woman tempest-tossed and
</l><l>tried
</l><l>  By household cares, and hosts of things
</l><l>beside,
</l><l>  With all my strength God bids me say

<l>ONE yestereve, in the waning light,
</l><l>When the wind was still and the
</l><l>gloaming bright,
</l><l>There came a breath from a far countrie,
</l><l>And the ghost of a Little House called
</l><l>to me.</l>
<lb/>

<l>"Have you forgotten me?" "No!" I cried.
</l><l>"Your hall was as narrow as this is wide,

</l><l>Till a ceiling fell, on my new frock too!</l>
<lb/>

<l>"In your parlour flooring a loose board hid,

<lb/>
<l>'T'WAS breakfast time, and outside in

</l><l>The factory men went by with hurrying
</l><l>feet.
</l><l>And on the bridge, in dim December light,
</l><l>The newsboys shouted of the great prize

</l><l>Then, as I dished the bacon, and served

</l><l>The letter-box had clicked, and through

</l><l>The <hi rend="italic">Picture News</hi> was suddenly pushed in.

<pb n="59"/>

</l><l>John showed the lads the pictures, and
</l><l>explained
</l><l>Just how the fight took place, and what
</l><l>was gained
</l><l>By that slim winner. Then, he looked at me
</l><l>As I sat, busy, pouring out the tea:
</l><l>"Your mother is a boxer, rightly styled.
</l><l>She hits the air sometimes, though," and
</l><l>John smiled.
</l><l>"Yet she fights on." Young Jack, with
</l><l>widened eyes
</l><l>Said: "Dad, how soon will mother get a
</l><l>prize?"
<lb/>
</l><l>We laughed. And yet it set me thinking,
</l><l>how
</l><l>I beat the air, because a neighbour's cow
</l><l>Munched at our early cabbages, and ate
</l><l>The lettuce up, and tramped my mignonette!
</l><l>And many a time I kicked against the
</l><l>pricks
</l><l>Because the little dog at number six
</l><l>Disturbed my rest. And then, how cross
</l><l>I got

<pb n="60"/>

</l><l>When Jane seemed discontented with her
</l><l>lot.
</l><l>Until poor John in desperation said
</l><l>He wearied of the theme &mdash; and went to
</l><l>bed!
<lb/>
</l><l>And how I vexed myself that day, when he
</l><l>Brought people unexpectedly for tea,
</l><l>Because the table-cloth was old and
</l><l>stained,
</l><l>And not a single piece of cake remained.
</l><l>And how my poor head ached! Because,
</l><l>well there!
</l><l>It uses lots of strength to beat the air!
<lb/>
</l><l>"I am a boxer!" Here and now I pray
</l><l>For grace to hit the self-life every day.
</l><l>And when the old annoyance comes once
</l><l>more
</l><l>And the old temper rises sharp and sore,
</l><l>I shall hit hard and straight, O Tender-</l><l>Wise,
