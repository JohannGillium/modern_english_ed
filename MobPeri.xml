<p><stage>Antioch. A room in the palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter ANTIOCHUS, Prince PERICLES, and followers</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>ANTIOCHUS</speaker>
<p>Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received<lb/>
The danger of the task you undertake.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul<lb/>
Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,<lb/>
Think death no hazard in this enterprise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIOCHUS</speaker>
<p>Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,<lb/>
For the embracements even of Jove himself;<lb/>
At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,<lb/>
Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,<lb/>
The senate-house of planets all did sit,<lb/>
To knit in her their best perfections.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Music. Enter the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,<lb/>
Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king<lb/>
Of every virtue gives renown to men!<lb/>
Her face the book of praises, where is read<lb/>
Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence<lb/>
Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath<lb/>
Could never be her mild companion.<lb/>
You gods that made me man, and sway in love,<lb/>
That have inflamed desire in my breast<lb/>
To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,<lb/>
Or die in the adventure, be my helps,<lb/>
As I am son and servant to your will,<lb/>
To compass such a boundless happiness!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIOCHUS</speaker>
<p>Prince Pericles,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>That would be son to great Antiochus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIOCHUS</speaker>
<p>Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,<lb/>
With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd;<lb/>
For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:<lb/>
Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view<lb/>
Her countless glory, which desert must gain;<lb/>
And which, without desert, because thine eye<lb/>
Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.<lb/>
Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,<lb/>
Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,<lb/>
Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,<lb/>
That without covering, save yon field of stars,<lb/>
Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;<lb/>
And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist<lb/>
For going on death's net, whom none resist.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught<lb/>
My frail mortality to know itself,<lb/>
And by those fearful objects to prepare<lb/>
This body, like to them, to what I must;<lb/>
For death remember'd should be like a mirror,<lb/>
Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.<lb/>
I'll make my will then, and, as sick men do<lb/>
Who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,<lb/>
Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;<lb/>
So I bequeath a happy peace to you<lb/>
And all good men, as every prince should do;<lb/>
My riches to the earth from whence they came;<lb/>
But my unspotted fire of love to you.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS</stage></p>


<p>
Thus ready for the way of life or death,<lb/>
I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIOCHUS</speaker>
<p>Scorning advice, read the conclusion then:<lb/>
Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,<lb/>
As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Daughter</speaker>
<p>Of all say'd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!<lb/>
Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,<lb/>
Nor ask advice of any other thought<lb/>
But faithfulness and courage.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>He reads the riddle</stage></p>


<p>
I am no viper, yet I feed<lb/>
On mother's flesh which did me breed.<lb/>
I sought a husband, in which labour<lb/>
I found that kindness in a father:<lb/>
He's father, son, and husband mild;<lb/>
I mother, wife, and yet his child.<lb/>
How they may be, and yet in two,<lb/>
As you will live, resolve it you.<lb/>

Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers<lb/>
That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,<lb/>
Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,<lb/>
If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?<lb/>
Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Takes hold of the hand of the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS</stage></p>


<p>
Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:<lb/>
But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt<lb/>
For he's no man on whom perfections wait<lb/>
That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.<lb/>
You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;<lb/>
Who, finger'd to make man his lawful music,<lb/>
Would draw heaven down, and all the gods, to hearken:<lb/>
But being play'd upon before your time,<lb/>
Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.<lb/>
Good sooth, I care not for you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIOCHUS</speaker>
<p>Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.<lb/>
For that's an article within our law,<lb/>
As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:<lb/>
Either expound now, or receive your sentence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Great king,<lb/>
Few love to hear the sins they love to act;<lb/>
'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.<lb/>
Who has a book of all that monarchs do,<lb/>
He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:<lb/>
For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.<lb/>
Blows dust in other's eyes, to spread itself;<lb/>
And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,<lb/>
The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear:<lb/>
To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts<lb/>
Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd<lb/>
By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for't.<lb/>
Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's<lb/>
their will;<lb/>
And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?<lb/>
It is enough you know; and it is fit,<lb/>
What being more known grows worse, to smother it.<lb/>
All love the womb that their first being bred,<lb/>
Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIOCHUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Heaven, that I had thy head! he has found<lb/>
the meaning:<lb/>
But I will gloze with him.&mdash;Young prince of Tyre,<lb/>
Though by the tenor of our strict edict,<lb/>
Your exposition misinterpreting,<lb/>
We might proceed to cancel of your days;<lb/>
Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree<lb/>
As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:<lb/>
Forty days longer we do respite you;<lb/>
If by which time our secret be undone,<lb/>
This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son:<lb/>
And until then your entertain shall be<lb/>
As doth befit our honour and your worth.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but PERICLES</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>How courtesy would seem to cover sin,<lb/>
When what is done is like an hypocrite,<lb/>
The which is good in nothing but in sight!<lb/>
If it be true that I interpret false,<lb/>
Then were it certain you were not so bad<lb/>
As with foul incest to abuse your soul;<lb/>
Where now you're both a father and a son,<lb/>
By your untimely claspings with your child,<lb/>
Which pleasure fits an husband, not a father;<lb/>
And she an eater of her mother's flesh,<lb/>
By the defiling of her parent's bed;<lb/>
And both like serpents are, who though they feed<lb/>
On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.<lb/>
Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men<lb/>
Blush not in actions blacker than the night,<lb/>
Will shun no course to keep them from the light.<lb/>
One sin, I know, another doth provoke;<lb/>
Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke:<lb/>
Poison and treason are the hands of sin,<lb/>
Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:<lb/>
Then, lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear,<lb/>
By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p><p><stage>Re-enter ANTIOCHUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIOCHUS</speaker>
<p>He hath found the meaning, for which we mean<lb/>
To have his head.<lb/>
He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,<lb/>
Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin<lb/>
In such a loathed manner;<lb/>
And therefore instantly this prince must die:<lb/>
For by his fall my honour must keep high.<lb/>
Who attends us there?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter THALIARD</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THALIARD</speaker>
<p>Doth your highness call?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIOCHUS</speaker>
<p>Thaliard,<lb/>
You are of our chamber, and our mind partakes<lb/>
Her private actions to your secrecy;<lb/>
And for your faithfulness we will advance you.<lb/>
Thaliard, behold, here's poison, and here's gold;<lb/>
We hate the prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:<lb/>
It fits thee not to ask the reason why,<lb/>
Because we bid it. Say, is it done?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THALIARD</speaker>
<p>My lord,<lb/>
'Tis done.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIOCHUS</speaker>
<p>Enough.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter a Messenger</stage></p>


<p>
Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>My lord, prince Pericles is fled.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIOCHUS</speaker>
<p>As thou<lb/>
Wilt live, fly after: and like an arrow shot<lb/>
From a well-experienced archer hits the mark<lb/>
His eye doth level at, so thou ne'er return<lb/>
Unless thou say 'Prince Pericles is dead.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THALIARD</speaker>
<p>My lord,<lb/>
If I can get him within my pistol's length,<lb/>
I'll make him sure enough: so, farewell to your highness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTIOCHUS</speaker>
<p>Thaliard, adieu!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit THALIARD</stage></p>


<p>
Till Pericles be dead,<lb/>
My heart can lend no succor to my head.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p></div2><div2 type="scene" n="2" id="d7">
<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>Tyre. A room in the palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter PERICLES</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p><stage>[To Lords without]</stage></p><p>  Let none disturb us.&mdash;Why should<lb/>
this change of thoughts,<lb/>
The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,<lb/>
Be my so used a guest as not an hour,<lb/>
In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,<lb/>
The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?<lb/>
Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,<lb/>
And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,<lb/>
Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:<lb/>
Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,<lb/>
Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.<lb/>
Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,<lb/>
That have their first conception by mis-dread,<lb/>
Have after-nourishment and life by care;<lb/>
And what was first but fear what might be done,<lb/>
Grows elder now and cares it be not done.<lb/>
And so with me: the great Antiochus,<lb/>
'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,<lb/>
Since he's so great can make his will his act,<lb/>
Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;<lb/>
Nor boots it me to say I honour him.<lb/>
If he suspect I may dishonour him:<lb/>
And what may make him blush in being known,<lb/>
He'll stop the course by which it might be known;<lb/>
With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,<lb/>
And with the ostent of war will look so huge,<lb/>
Amazement shall drive courage from the state;<lb/>
Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,<lb/>
And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:<lb/>
Which care of them, not pity of myself,<lb/>
Who am no more but as the tops of trees,<lb/>
Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,<lb/>
Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,<lb/>
And punish that before that he would punish.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter HELICANUS, with other Lords</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>And keep your mind, till you return to us,<lb/>
Peaceful and comfortable!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.<lb/>
They do abuse the king that flatter him:<lb/>
For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;<lb/>
The thing which is flatter'd, but a spark,<lb/>
To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing;<lb/>
Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,<lb/>
Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.<lb/>
When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,<lb/>
He flatters you, makes war upon your life.<lb/>
Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please;<lb/>
I cannot be much lower than my knees.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>All leave us else; but let your cares o'erlook<lb/>
What shipping and what lading's in our haven,<lb/>
And then return to us.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt Lords</stage></p>


<p>
Helicanus, thou<lb/>
Hast moved us: what seest thou in our looks?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>An angry brow, dread lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,<lb/>
How durst thy tongue move anger to our face?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>How dare the plants look up to heaven, from whence<lb/>
They have their nourishment?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Thou know'st I have power<lb/>
To take thy life from thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p><stage>[Kneeling]</stage></p><p>
I have ground the axe myself;<lb/>
Do you but strike the blow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Rise, prithee, rise.<lb/>
Sit down: thou art no flatterer:<lb/>
I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid<lb/>
That kings should let their ears hear their<lb/>
faults hid!<lb/>
Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,<lb/>
Who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant,<lb/>
What wouldst thou have me do?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>To bear with patience<lb/>
Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,<lb/>
That minister'st a potion unto me<lb/>
That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.<lb/>
Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,<lb/>
Where as thou know'st, against the face of death,<lb/>
I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.<lb/>
From whence an issue I might propagate,<lb/>
Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.<lb/>
Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;<lb/>
The rest&mdash;hark in thine ear&mdash;as black as incest:<lb/>
Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father<lb/>
Seem'd not to strike, but smooth: but thou<lb/>
know'st this,<lb/>
'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.<lb/>
Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,<lb/>
Under the covering of a careful night,<lb/>
Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,<lb/>
Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.<lb/>
I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears<lb/>
Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:<lb/>
And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,<lb/>
That I should open to the listening air<lb/>
How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,<lb/>
To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,<lb/>
To lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,<lb/>
And make pretence of wrong that I have done him:<lb/>
When all, for mine, if I may call offence,<lb/>
Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:<lb/>
Which love to all, of which thyself art one,<lb/>
Who now reprovest me for it,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>Alas, sir!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,<lb/>
Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts<lb/>
How I might stop this tempest ere it came;<lb/>
And finding little comfort to relieve them,<lb/>
I thought it princely charity to grieve them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak.<lb/>
Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,<lb/>
And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,<lb/>
Who either by public war or private treason<lb/>
Will take away your life.<lb/>
Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,<lb/>
Till that his rage and anger be forgot,<lb/>
Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.<lb/>
Your rule direct to any; if to me.<lb/>
Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>I do not doubt thy faith;<lb/>
But should he wrong my liberties in my absence?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>We'll mingle our bloods together in the earth,<lb/>
From whence we had our being and our birth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tarsus<lb/>
Intend my travel, where I'll hear from thee;<lb/>
And by whose letters I'll dispose myself.<lb/>
The care I had and have of subjects' good<lb/>
On thee I lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it.<lb/>
I'll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath:<lb/>
Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both:<lb/>
But in our orbs we'll live so round and safe,<lb/>
That time of both this truth shall ne'er convince,<lb/>
Thou show'dst a subject's shine, I a true prince.<lb/>

<head>Scene 3</head>

<p><stage>Tyre. An ante-chamber in the palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter THALIARD</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>THALIARD</speaker>
<p>So, this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must I<lb/>
kill King Pericles; and if I do it not, I am sure to<lb/>
be hanged at home: 'tis dangerous. Well, I perceive<lb/>
he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that,<lb/>
being bid to ask what he would of the king, desired<lb/>
he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he<lb/>
had some reason for't; for if a king bid a man be a<lb/>
villain, he's bound by the indenture of his oath to<lb/>
be one! Hush! here come the lords of Tyre.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES, with other Lords of Tyre</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,<lb/>
Further to question me of your king's departure:<lb/>
His seal'd commission, left in trust with me,<lb/>
Doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THALIARD</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  How! the king gone!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>If further yet you will be satisfied,<lb/>
Why, as it were unlicensed of your loves,<lb/>
He would depart, I'll give some light unto you.<lb/>
Being at Antioch&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THALIARD</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>          What from Antioch?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>Royal Antiochus&mdash;on what cause I know not&mdash;<lb/>
Took some displeasure at him; at least he judged so:<lb/>
And doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,<lb/>
To show his sorrow, he'ld correct himself;<lb/>
So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,<lb/>
With whom each minute threatens life or death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THALIARD</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Well, I perceive<lb/>
I shall not be hang'd now, although I would;<lb/>
But since he's gone, the king's seas must please:<lb/>
He 'scaped the land, to perish at the sea.<lb/>
I'll present myself. Peace to the lords of Tyre!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THALIARD</speaker>
<p>From him I come<lb/>
With message unto princely Pericles;<lb/>
But since my landing I have understood<lb/>
Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels,<lb/>
My message must return from whence it came.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>We have no reason to desire it,<lb/>
Commended to our master, not to us:<lb/>
Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,<lb/>
As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.<lb/>

<head>Scene 4</head>

<p><stage>Tarsus. A room in the Governor's house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter CLEON, the governor of Tarsus, with DIONYZA,	and others</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>CLEON</speaker>
<p>My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,<lb/>
And by relating tales of others' griefs,<lb/>
See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIONYZA</speaker>
<p>That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;<lb/>
For who digs hills because they do aspire<lb/>
Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.<lb/>
O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;<lb/>
Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,<lb/>
But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEON</speaker>
<p>O Dionyza,<lb/>
Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,<lb/>
Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?<lb/>
Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep<lb/>
Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,<lb/>
Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;<lb/>
That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,<lb/>
They may awake their helps to comfort them.<lb/>
I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,<lb/>
And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIONYZA</speaker>
<p>I'll do my best, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEON</speaker>
<p>This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,<lb/>
A city on whom plenty held full hand,<lb/>
For riches strew'd herself even in the streets;<lb/>
Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,<lb/>
And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at;<lb/>
Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,<lb/>
Like one another's glass to trim them by:<lb/>
Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,<lb/>
And not so much to feed on as delight;<lb/>
All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,<lb/>
The name of help grew odious to repeat.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIONYZA</speaker>
<p>O, 'tis too true.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEON</speaker>
<p>But see what heaven can do! By this our change,<lb/>
These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,<lb/>
Were all too little to content and please,<lb/>
Although they gave their creatures in abundance,<lb/>
As houses are defiled for want of use,<lb/>
They are now starved for want of exercise:<lb/>
Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,<lb/>
Must have inventions to delight the taste,<lb/>
Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:<lb/>
Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,<lb/>
Thought nought too curious, are ready now<lb/>
To eat those little darlings whom they loved.<lb/>
So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife<lb/>
Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:<lb/>
Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;<lb/>
Here many sink, yet those which see them fall<lb/>
Have scarce strength left to give them burial.<lb/>
Is not this true?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIONYZA</speaker>
<p>Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEON</speaker>
<p>O, let those cities that of plenty's cup<lb/>
And her prosperities so largely taste,<lb/>
With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!<lb/>
The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Lord</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord</speaker>
<p>Where's the lord governor?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEON</speaker>
<p>Here.<lb/>
Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,<lb/>
For comfort is too far for us to expect.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord</speaker>
<p>We have descried, upon our neighbouring shore,<lb/>
A portly sail of ships make hitherward.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEON</speaker>
<p>I thought as much.<lb/>
One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,<lb/>
That may succeed as his inheritor;<lb/>
And so in ours: some neighbouring nation,<lb/>
Taking advantage of our misery,<lb/>
Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,<lb/>
To beat us down, the which are down already;<lb/>
And make a conquest of unhappy me,<lb/>
Whereas no glory's got to overcome.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord</speaker>
<p>That's the least fear; for, by the semblance<lb/>
Of their white flags display'd, they bring us peace,<lb/>
And come to us as favourers, not as foes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEON</speaker>
<p>Thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat:<lb/>
Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.<lb/>
But bring they what they will and what they can,<lb/>
What need we fear?<lb/>
The ground's the lowest, and we are half way there.<lb/>
Go tell their general we attend him here,<lb/>
To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,<lb/>
And what he craves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord</speaker>
<p>I go, my lord.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEON</speaker>
<p>Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist;<lb/>
If wars, we are unable to resist.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter PERICLES with Attendants</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Lord governor, for so we hear you are,<lb/>
Let not our ships and number of our men<lb/>
Be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes.<lb/>
We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,<lb/>
And seen the desolation of your streets:<lb/>
Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,<lb/>
But to relieve them of their heavy load;<lb/>
And these our ships, you happily may think<lb/>
Are like the Trojan horse was stuff'd within<lb/>
With bloody veins, expecting overthrow,<lb/>
Are stored with corn to make your needy bread,<lb/>
And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>The gods of Greece protect you!<lb/>
And we'll pray for you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Arise, I pray you, rise:<lb/>
We do not look for reverence, but to love,<lb/>
And harbourage for ourself, our ships, and men.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEON</speaker>
<p>The which when any shall not gratify,<lb/>
Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,<lb/>
Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,<lb/>
The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!<lb/>
Till when,&mdash;the which I hope shall ne'er be seen,&mdash;<lb/>
Your grace is welcome to our town and us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Which welcome we'll accept; feast here awhile,<lb/>
Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOWER</speaker>
<p>Here have you seen a mighty king<lb/>
His child, I wis, to incest bring;<lb/>
A better prince and benign lord,<lb/>
That will prove awful both in deed and word.<lb/>
Be quiet then as men should be,<lb/>
Till he hath pass'd necessity.<lb/>
I'll show you those in troubles reign,<lb/>
Losing a mite, a mountain gain.<lb/>
The good in conversation,<lb/>
To whom I give my benison,<lb/>
Is still at Tarsus, where each man<lb/>
Thinks all is writ he speken can;<lb/>
And, to remember what he does,<lb/>
Build his statue to make him glorious:<lb/>
But tidings to the contrary<lb/>
Are brought your eyes; what need speak I?<lb/>

<p>
Good Helicane, that stay'd at home,<lb/>
Not to eat honey like a drone<lb/>
From others' labours; for though he strive<lb/>
To killen bad, keep good alive;<lb/>
And to fulfil his prince' desire,<lb/>
Sends word of all that haps in Tyre:<lb/>
How Thaliard came full bent with sin<lb/>
And had intent to murder him;<lb/>
And that in Tarsus was not best<lb/>
Longer for him to make his rest.<lb/>
He, doing so, put forth to seas,<lb/>
Where when men been, there's seldom ease;<lb/>
For now the wind begins to blow;<lb/>
Thunder above and deeps below<lb/>
Make such unquiet, that the ship<lb/>
Should house him safe is wreck'd and split;<lb/>
And he, good prince, having all lost,<lb/>
By waves from coast to coast is tost:<lb/>
All perishen of man, of pelf,<lb/>
Ne aught escapen but himself;<lb/>
Till fortune, tired with doing bad,<lb/>
Threw him ashore, to give him glad:<lb/>
And here he comes. What shall be next,<lb/>

Wind, rain, and thunder, remember, earthly man<lb/>

Alas, the sea hath cast me on the rocks,<lb/>

Nothing to think on but ensuing death:<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter three FISHERMEN</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Fisherman</speaker>
<p>What, ho, Pilch!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Fisherman</speaker>
<p>Ha, come and bring away the nets!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Fisherman</speaker>
<p>What, Patch-breech, I say!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Fisherman</speaker>
<p>What say you, master?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Fisherman</speaker>
<p>Look how thou stirrest now! come away, or I'll<lb/>
fetch thee with a wanion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Fisherman</speaker>
<p>Faith, master, I am thinking of the poor men that<lb/>
were cast away before us even now.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Fisherman</speaker>
<p>Alas, poor souls, it grieved my heart to hear what<lb/>
pitiful cries they made to us to help them, when,<lb/>
well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Fisherman</speaker>
<p>Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw the<lb/>
porpus how he bounced and tumbled? they say<lb/>
they're half fish, half flesh: a plague on them,<lb/>
they ne'er come but I look to be washed. Master, I<lb/>
marvel how the fishes live in the sea.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Fisherman</speaker>
<p>Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the<lb/>
little ones: I can compare our rich misers to<lb/>
nothing so fitly as to a whale; a' plays and<lb/>
tumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at<lb/>
last devours them all at a mouthful: such whales<lb/>
have I heard on o' the land, who never leave gaping<lb/>
till they've swallowed the whole parish, church,<lb/>
steeple, bells, and all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  A pretty moral.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Fisherman</speaker>
<p>But, master, if I had been the sexton, I would have<lb/>
been that day in the belfry.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Fisherman</speaker>
<p>Why, man?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Fisherman</speaker>
<p>Because he should have swallowed me too: and when I<lb/>
had been in his belly, I would have kept such a<lb/>
jangling of the bells, that he should never have<lb/>
left, till he cast bells, steeple, church, and<lb/>
parish up again. But if the good King Simonides<lb/>
were of my mind,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Simonides!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Fisherman</speaker>
<p>We would purge the land of these drones, that rob<lb/>
the bee of her honey.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  How from the finny subject of the sea<lb/>
These fishers tell the infirmities of men;<lb/>
And from their watery empire recollect<lb/>
All that may men approve or men detect!<lb/>
Peace be at your labour, honest fishermen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Fisherman</speaker>
<p>Honest! good fellow, what's that? If it be a day<lb/>
fits you, search out of the calendar, and nobody<lb/>
look after it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>May see the sea hath cast upon your coast.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Fisherman</speaker>
<p>What a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our<lb/>
way!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>A man whom both the waters and the wind,<lb/>
In that vast tennis-court, have made the ball<lb/>
For them to play upon, entreats you pity him:<lb/>
He asks of you, that never used to beg.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Fisherman</speaker>
<p>No, friend, cannot you beg? Here's them in our<lb/>
country Greece gets more with begging than we can do<lb/>
with working.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Fisherman</speaker>
<p>Canst thou catch any fishes, then?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>I never practised it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Fisherman</speaker>
<p>Nay, then thou wilt starve, sure; for here's nothing<lb/>
to be got now-a-days, unless thou canst fish for't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>What I have been I have forgot to know;<lb/>
But what I am, want teaches me to think on:<lb/>
A man throng'd up with cold: my veins are chill,<lb/>
And have no more of life than may suffice<lb/>
To give my tongue that heat to ask your help;<lb/>
Which if you shall refuse, when I am dead,<lb/>
For that I am a man, pray see me buried.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Fisherman</speaker>
<p>Die quoth-a? Now gods forbid! I have a gown here;<lb/>
come, put it on; keep thee warm. Now, afore me, a<lb/>
handsome fellow! Come, thou shalt go home, and<lb/>
we'll have flesh for holidays, fish for<lb/>
fasting-days, and moreo'er puddings and flap-jacks,<lb/>
and thou shalt be welcome.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>I thank you, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Fisherman</speaker>
<p>Hark you, my friend; you said you could not beg.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>I did but crave.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Fisherman</speaker>
<p>But crave! Then I'll turn craver too, and so I<lb/>
shall 'scape whipping.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Why, are all your beggars whipped, then?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Fisherman</speaker>
<p>O, not all, my friend, not all; for if all your<lb/>
beggars were whipped, I would wish no better office<lb/>
than to be beadle. But, master, I'll go draw up the<lb/>
net.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Not well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Fisherman</speaker>
<p>Why, I'll tell you: this is called Pentapolis, and<lb/>
our king the good Simonides.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>The good King Simonides, do you call him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Fisherman</speaker>
<p>Ay, sir; and he deserves so to be called for his<lb/>
peaceable reign and good government.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>He is a happy king, since he gains from his subjects<lb/>
the name of good by his government. How far is his<lb/>
court distant from this shore?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Fisherman</speaker>
<p>Marry, sir, half a day's journey: and I'll tell<lb/>
you, he hath a fair daughter, and to-morrow is her<lb/>
birth-day; and there are princes and knights come<lb/>
from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Were my fortunes equal to my desires, I could wish<lb/>
to make one there.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Fisherman</speaker>

come out. Ha! bots on't, 'tis come at last, and<lb/>
'tis turned to a rusty armour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>An armour, friends! I pray you, let me see it.<lb/>
Thanks, fortune, yet, that, after all my crosses,<lb/>
Thou givest me somewhat to repair myself;<lb/>
And though it was mine own, part of my heritage,<lb/>
Which my dead father did bequeath to me.<lb/>
With this strict charge, even as he left his life,<lb/>
'Keep it, my Pericles; it hath been a shield<lb/>
Twixt me and death;'&mdash;and pointed to this brace;&mdash;<lb/>
'For that it saved me, keep it; in like necessity&mdash;<lb/>
The which the gods protect thee from!&mdash;may<lb/>
defend thee.'<lb/>
It kept where I kept, I so dearly loved it;<lb/>
Till the rough seas, that spare not any man,<lb/>
Took it in rage, though calm'd have given't again:<lb/>
I thank thee for't: my shipwreck now's no ill,<lb/>
Since I have here my father's gift in's will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Fisherman</speaker>
<p>What mean you, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth,<lb/>
For it was sometime target to a king;<lb/>
I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly,<lb/>
And for his sake I wish the having of it;<lb/>
And that you'ld guide me to your sovereign's court,<lb/>
Where with it I may appear a gentleman;<lb/>
And if that ever my low fortune's better,<lb/>
I'll pay your bounties; till then rest your debtor.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Fisherman</speaker>
<p>Why, wilt thou tourney for the lady?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>I'll show the virtue I have borne in arms.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Fisherman</speaker>
<p>Why, do 'e take it, and the gods give thee good on't!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Fisherman</speaker>
<p>Ay, but hark you, my friend; 'twas we that made up<lb/>
this garment through the rough seams of the waters:<lb/>
there are certain condolements, certain vails. I<lb/>
hope, sir, if you thrive, you'll remember from<lb/>
whence you had it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Believe 't, I will.<lb/>
By your furtherance I am clothed in steel;<lb/>
And, spite of all the rapture of the sea,<lb/>
This jewel holds his building on my arm:<lb/>
Unto thy value I will mount myself<lb/>
Upon a courser, whose delightful steps<lb/>
Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.<lb/>
Only, my friend, I yet am unprovided<lb/>
Of a pair of bases.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Fisherman</speaker>
<p>We'll sure provide: thou shalt have my best gown to<lb/>
make thee a pair; and I'll bring thee to the court myself.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>Which shows that beauty hath his power and will,<lb/>
Which can as well inflame as it can kill.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>The Fifth Knight passes over</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>The fifth, an hand environed with clouds,<lb/>
Holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried;<lb/>
The motto thus, 'Sic spectanda fides.'<lb/>


</p><p><stage>The Sixth Knight, PERICLES, passes over</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>And what's<lb/>
The sixth and last, the which the knight himself<lb/>
With such a graceful courtesy deliver'd?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>He seems to be a stranger; but his present is<lb/>
A wither'd branch, that's only green at top;<lb/>
The motto, 'In hac spe vivo.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>A pretty moral;<lb/>
From the dejected state wherein he is,<lb/>
He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>He had need mean better than his outward show<lb/>
Can any way speak in his just commend;<lb/>
For by his rusty outside he appears<lb/>
To have practised more the whipstock than the lance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>He well may be a stranger, for he comes<lb/>
To an honour'd triumph strangely furnished.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Lord</speaker>
<p>And on set purpose let his armour rust<lb/>
Until this day, to scour it in the dust.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan<lb/>
The outward habit by the inward man.<lb/>
But stay, the knights are coming: we will withdraw<lb/>
Into the gallery.<lb/>

<head>Scene 3</head>

<p><stage>The same. A hall of state: a banquet prepared.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter SIMONIDES, THAISA, Lords, Attendants, and	Knights, from tilting</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>Knights,<lb/>
To say you're welcome were superfluous.<lb/>
To place upon the volume of your deeds,<lb/>
As in a title-page, your worth in arms,<lb/>
Were more than you expect, or more than's fit,<lb/>
Since every worth in show commends itself.<lb/>
Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast:<lb/>
You are princes and my guests.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>But you, my knight and guest;<lb/>
To whom this wreath of victory I give,<lb/>
And crown you king of this day's happiness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>'Tis more by fortune, lady, than by merit.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>Call it by what you will, the day is yours;<lb/>
And here, I hope, is none that envies it.<lb/>
In framing an artist, art hath thus decreed,<lb/>
To make some good, but others to exceed;<lb/>
And you are her labour'd scholar. Come, queen o'<lb/>
the feast,&mdash;<lb/>
For, daughter, so you are,&mdash;here take your place:<lb/>
Marshal the rest, as they deserve their grace.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KNIGHTS</speaker>
<p>We are honour'd much by good Simonides.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>Your presence glads our days: honour we love;<lb/>
For who hates honour hates the gods above.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Marshal</speaker>
<p>Sir, yonder is your place.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Some other is more fit.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Knight</speaker>
<p>Contend not, sir; for we are gentlemen<lb/>
That neither in our hearts nor outward eyes<lb/>
Envy the great nor do the low despise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>You are right courteous knights.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>Sit, sir, sit.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>By Jove, I wonder, that is king of thoughts,<lb/>
These cates resist me, she but thought upon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>By Juno, that is queen of marriage,<lb/>
All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury.<lb/>
Wishing him my meat. Sure, he's a gallant gentleman.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>He's but a country gentleman;<lb/>
Has done no more than other knights have done;<lb/>
Has broken a staff or so; so let it pass.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>To me he seems like diamond to glass.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Yon king's to me like to my father's picture,<lb/>
Which tells me in that glory once he was;<lb/>
Had princes sit, like stars, about his throne,<lb/>
And he the sun, for them to reverence;<lb/>
None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights,<lb/>
Did vail their crowns to his supremacy:<lb/>
Where now his son's like a glow-worm in the night,<lb/>
The which hath fire in darkness, none in light:<lb/>
Whereby I see that Time's the king of men,<lb/>
He's both their parent, and he is their grave,<lb/>
And gives them what he will, not what they crave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>What, are you merry, knights?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Knights</speaker>
<p>Who can be other in this royal presence?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,&mdash;<lb/>
As you do love, fill to your mistress' lips,&mdash;<lb/>
We drink this health to you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>KNIGHTS</speaker>
<p>We thank your grace.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>Yet pause awhile:<lb/>
Yon knight doth sit too melancholy,<lb/>
As if the entertainment in our court<lb/>
Had not a show might countervail his worth.<lb/>
Note it not you, Thaisa?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>What is it<lb/>
To me, my father?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>O, attend, my daughter:<lb/>
Princes in this should live like gods above,<lb/>
Who freely give to every one that comes<lb/>
To honour them:<lb/>
And princes not doing so are like to gnats,<lb/>
Which make a sound, but kill'd are wonder'd at.<lb/>
Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,<lb/>
Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>Alas, my father, it befits not me<lb/>
Unto a stranger knight to be so bold:<lb/>
He may my proffer take for an offence,<lb/>
Since men take women's gifts for impudence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>How!<lb/>
Do as I bid you, or you'll move me else.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  Now, by the gods, he could not please me better.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>And furthermore tell him, we desire to know of him,<lb/>
Of whence he is, his name and parentage.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>The king my father, sir, has drunk to you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>I thank him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>Wishing it so much blood unto your life.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>And further he desires to know of you,<lb/>
Of whence you are, your name and parentage.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>A gentleman of Tyre; my name, Pericles;<lb/>
My education been in arts and arms;<lb/>
Who, looking for adventures in the world,<lb/>
Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men,<lb/>
And after shipwreck driven upon this shore.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>He thanks your grace; names himself Pericles,<lb/>
A gentleman of Tyre,<lb/>
Who only by misfortune of the seas<lb/>
Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune,<lb/>
And will awake him from his melancholy.<lb/>
Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,<lb/>
And waste the time, which looks for other revels.<lb/>
Even in your armours, as you are address'd,<lb/>
Will very well become a soldier's dance.<lb/>
I will not have excuse, with saying this<lb/>
Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,<lb/>
Since they love men in arms as well as beds.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>The Knights dance</stage></p>


<p>
So, this was well ask'd,'twas so well perform'd.<lb/>
Come, sir;<lb/>
Here is a lady that wants breathing too:<lb/>
And I have heard, you knights of Tyre<lb/>
Are excellent in making ladies trip;<lb/>
And that their measures are as excellent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>In those that practise them they are, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>O, that's as much as you would be denied<lb/>
Of your fair courtesy.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>The Knights and Ladies dance</stage></p>


<p>
Unclasp, unclasp:<lb/>
Thanks, gentlemen, to all; all have done well.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To PERICLES</stage></p>


<p>
But you the best. Pages and lights, to conduct<lb/>
These knights unto their several lodgings!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To PERICLES</stage></p>


<p>
Yours, sir,<lb/>
We have given order to be next our own.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>I am at your grace's pleasure.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>Princes, it is too late to talk of love;<lb/>
And that's the mark I know you level at:<lb/>
Therefore each one betake him to his rest;<lb/>
To-morrow all for speeding do their best.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>No, Escanes, know this of me,<lb/>
Antiochus from incest lived not free:<lb/>
For which, the most high gods not minding longer<lb/>
To withhold the vengeance that they had in store,<lb/>
Due to this heinous capital offence,<lb/>
Even in the height and pride of all his glory,<lb/>
When he was seated in a chariot<lb/>
Of an inestimable value, and his daughter with him,<lb/>
A fire from heaven came and shrivell'd up<lb/>
Their bodies, even to loathing; for they so stunk,<lb/>
That all those eyes adored them ere their fall<lb/>
Scorn now their hand should give them burial.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ESCANES</speaker>
<p>'Twas very strange.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>And yet but justice; for though<lb/>
This king were great, his greatness was no guard<lb/>
To bar heaven's shaft, but sin had his reward.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ESCANES</speaker>
<p>'Tis very true.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter two or three Lords</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>See, not a man in private conference<lb/>
Or council has respect with him but he.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>It shall no longer grieve without reproof.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Third Lord</speaker>
<p>And cursed be he that will not second it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Follow me, then. Lord Helicane, a word.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>With me? and welcome: happy day, my lords.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Know that our griefs are risen to the top,<lb/>
And now at length they overflow their banks.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>Your griefs! for what? wrong not your prince you love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Wrong not yourself, then, noble Helicane;<lb/>
But if the prince do live, let us salute him,<lb/>
Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.<lb/>
If in the world he live, we'll seek him out;<lb/>
If in his grave he rest, we'll find him there;<lb/>
And be resolved he lives to govern us,<lb/>
Or dead, give's cause to mourn his funeral,<lb/>
And leave us to our free election.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Lord</speaker>
<p>Whose death indeed's the strongest in our censure:<lb/>
And knowing this kingdom is without a head,&mdash;<lb/>
Like goodly buildings left without a roof<lb/>
Soon fall to ruin,&mdash;your noble self,<lb/>
That best know how to rule and how to reign,<lb/>
We thus submit unto,&mdash;our sovereign.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>All</speaker>
<p>Live, noble Helicane!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>For honour's cause, forbear your suffrages:<lb/>
If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear.<lb/>
Take I your wish, I leap into the seas,<lb/>
Where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease.<lb/>
A twelvemonth longer, let me entreat you to<lb/>
Forbear the absence of your king:<lb/>
If in which time expired, he not return,<lb/>
I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.<lb/>
But if I cannot win you to this love,<lb/>
Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,<lb/>
And in your search spend your adventurous worth;<lb/>
Whom if you find, and win unto return,<lb/>
You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>To wisdom he's a fool that will not yield;<lb/>
And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us,<lb/>
We with our travels will endeavour us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>Then you love us, we you, and we'll clasp hands:<lb/>
When peers thus knit, a kingdom ever stands.<lb/>

<p>Good morrow to the good Simonides.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>Knights, from my daughter this I let you know,<lb/>
That for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake<lb/>
A married life.<lb/>
Her reason to herself is only known,<lb/>
Which yet from her by no means can I get.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Knight</speaker>
<p>May we not get access to her, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>'Faith, by no means; she has so strictly tied<lb/>
Her to her chamber, that 'tis impossible.<lb/>
One twelve moons more she'll wear Diana's livery;<lb/>
This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vow'd<lb/>
And on her virgin honour will not break it.<lb/>

She tells me here, she'd wed the stranger knight,<lb/>
Or never more to view nor day nor light.<lb/>
'Tis well, mistress; your choice agrees with mine;<lb/>
I like that well: nay, how absolute she's in't,<lb/>
Not minding whether I dislike or no!<lb/>
Well, I do commend her choice;<lb/>
And will no longer have it be delay'd.<lb/>
Soft! here he comes: I must dissemble it.<lb/>

<p>All fortune to the good Simonides!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>To you as much, sir! I am beholding to you<lb/>
For your sweet music this last night: I do<lb/>
Protest my ears were never better fed<lb/>
With such delightful pleasing harmony.<lb/>

<p>It is your grace's pleasure to commend;<lb/>
Not my desert.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>A most virtuous princess.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>And she is fair too, is she not?<lb/>

<p>As a fair day in summer, wondrous fair.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>Sir, my daughter thinks very well of you;<lb/>
Ay, so well, that you must be her master,<lb/>
And she will be your scholar: therefore look to it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>I am unworthy for her schoolmaster.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>She thinks not so; peruse this writing else.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage></p><p>  What's here?<lb/>
A letter, that she loves the knight of Tyre!<lb/>
'Tis the king's subtlety to have my life.<lb/>
O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,<lb/>
A stranger and distressed gentleman,<lb/>
That never aim'd so high to love your daughter,<lb/>
But bent all offices to honour her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>SIMONIDES</speaker>
<p>Thou hast bewitch'd my daughter, and thou art<lb/>
A villain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>By the gods, I have not:<lb/>

Nor never did my actions yet commence<lb/>
A deed might gain her love or your displeasure.<lb/>

<p>Why, sir, say if you had,<lb/>

<p>
who, for aught I know,<lb/>
May be, nor can I think the contrary,<lb/>
As great in blood as I myself.&mdash;<lb/>
Therefore hear you, mistress; either frame<lb/>
Your will to mine,&mdash;and you, sir, hear you,<lb/>
Either be ruled by me, or I will make you&mdash;<lb/>
Man and wife:<lb/>
Nay, come, your hands and lips must seal it too:<lb/>
And being join'd, I'll thus your hopes destroy;<lb/>
And for a further grief,&mdash;God give you joy!&mdash;<lb/>
What, are you both pleased?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>Yes, if you love me, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Even as my life, or blood that fosters it.<lb/>

<p>What, are you both agreed?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOTH</speaker>
<p>Yes, if it please your majesty.<lb/>

The cat, with eyne of burning coal,<lb/>
Now crouches fore the mouse's hole;<lb/>
And crickets sing at the oven's mouth,<lb/>
E'er the blither for their drouth.<lb/>
Hymen hath brought the bride to bed.<lb/>
Where, by the loss of maidenhead,<lb/>
A babe is moulded. Be attent,<lb/>

DUMB SHOW.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter, PERICLES and SIMONIDES at one door, with	Attendants; a Messenger meets them, kneels, and	gives PERICLES a letter: PERICLES shows it	SIMONIDES; the Lords kneel to him.

Then exeunt	SIMONIDES and the rest</stage></p>


<p>
By many a dern and painful perch<lb/>
Of Pericles the careful search,<lb/>
By the four opposing coigns<lb/>
Which the world together joins,<lb/>
Is made with all due diligence<lb/>
That horse and sail and high expense<lb/>
Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,<lb/>
Fame answering the most strange inquire,<lb/>
To the court of King Simonides<lb/>
Are letters brought, the tenor these:<lb/>
Antiochus and his daughter dead;<lb/>
The men of Tyrus on the head<lb/>
Of Helicanus would set on<lb/>
The crown of Tyre, but he will none:<lb/>
The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress;<lb/>
Says to 'em, if King Pericles<lb/>
Come not home in twice six moons,<lb/>
He, obedient to their dooms,<lb/>
Will take the crown. The sum of this,<lb/>
Brought hither to Pentapolis,<lb/>
Y-ravished the regions round,<lb/>
And every one with claps can sound,<lb/>
'Our heir-apparent is a king!<lb/>
Who dream'd, who thought of such a thing?'<lb/>
Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:<lb/>
His queen with child makes her desire&mdash;<lb/>
Which who shall cross?&mdash;along to go:<lb/>
Omit we all their dole and woe:<lb/>
Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,<lb/>
And so to sea. Their vessel shakes<lb/>
On Neptune's billow; half the flood<lb/>
Hath their keel cut: but fortune's mood<lb/>
Varies again; the grisly north<lb/>
Disgorges such a tempest forth,<lb/>
That, as a duck for life that dives,<lb/>
So up and down the poor ship drives:<lb/>
The lady shrieks, and well-a-near<lb/>
Does fall in travail with her fear:<lb/>
And what ensues in this fell storm<lb/>
Shall for itself itself perform.<lb/>
I nill relate, action may<lb/>
Conveniently the rest convey;<lb/>
Which might not what by me is told.<lb/>

Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,<lb/>
Having call'd them from the deep! O, still<lb/>
Thy deafening, dreadful thunders; gently quench<lb/>
Thy nimble, sulphurous flashes! O, how, Lychorida,<lb/>
How does my queen? Thou stormest venomously;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYCHORIDA</speaker>
<p>Patience, good sir; do not assist the storm.<lb/>
Here's all that is left living of your queen,<lb/>
A little daughter: for the sake of it,<lb/>
Be manly, and take comfort.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>O you gods!<lb/>
Why do you make us love your goodly gifts,<lb/>
And snatch them straight away? We here below<lb/>
Recall not what we give, and therein may<lb/>
Use honour with you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYCHORIDA</speaker>
<p>Patience, good sir,<lb/>
Even for this charge.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Now, mild may be thy life!<lb/>
For a more blustrous birth had never babe:<lb/>
Quiet and gentle thy conditions! for<lb/>
Thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world<lb/>
That ever was prince's child. Happy what follows!<lb/>
Thou hast as chiding a nativity<lb/>
As fire, air, water, earth, and heaven can make,<lb/>
To herald thee from the womb: even at the first<lb/>
Thy loss is more than can thy portage quit,<lb/>
With all thou canst find here. Now, the good gods<lb/>
Throw their best eyes upon't!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter two Sailors</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Sailor</speaker>
<p>What courage, sir? God save you!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Courage enough: I do not fear the flaw;<lb/>
It hath done to me the worst. Yet, for the love<lb/>
Of this poor infant, this fresh-new sea-farer,<lb/>
I would it would be quiet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Sailor</speaker>
<p>Slack the bolins there! Thou wilt not, wilt thou?<lb/>
Blow, and split thyself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Sailor</speaker>
<p>But sea-room, an the brine and cloudy billow kiss<lb/>
the moon, I care not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Sailor</speaker>
<p>Sir, your queen must overboard: the sea works high,<lb/>
the wind is loud, and will not lie till the ship be<lb/>
cleared of the dead.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>That's your superstition.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Sailor</speaker>
<p>Pardon us, sir; with us at sea it hath been still<lb/>
observed: and we are strong in custom. Therefore<lb/>
briefly yield her; for she must overboard straight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>As you think meet. Most wretched queen!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYCHORIDA</speaker>
<p>Here she lies, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>A terrible childbed hast thou had, my dear;<lb/>
No light, no fire: the unfriendly elements<lb/>
Forgot thee utterly: nor have I time<lb/>
To give thee hallow'd to thy grave, but straight<lb/>
Must cast thee, scarcely coffin'd, in the ooze;<lb/>
Where, for a monument upon thy bones,<lb/>
And e'er-remaining lamps, the belching whale<lb/>
And humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse,<lb/>
Lying with simple shells. O Lychorida,<lb/>
Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper,<lb/>
My casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander<lb/>
Bring me the satin coffer: lay the babe<lb/>
Upon the pillow: hie thee, whiles I say<lb/>
A priestly farewell to her: suddenly, woman.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit LYCHORIDA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Sailor</speaker>
<p>Sir, we have a chest beneath the hatches, caulked<lb/>
and bitumed ready.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>I thank thee. Mariner, say what coast is this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Sailor</speaker>
<p>We are near Tarsus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Thither, gentle mariner.<lb/>
Alter thy course for Tyre. When canst thou reach it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Sailor</speaker>
<p>By break of day, if the wind cease.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>O, make for Tarsus!<lb/>
There will I visit Cleon, for the babe<lb/>
Cannot hold out to Tyrus: there I'll leave it<lb/>
At careful nursing. Go thy ways, good mariner:<lb/>
I'll bring the body presently.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Good morrow.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Good morrow to your lordship.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CERIMON</speaker>
<p>Gentlemen,<lb/>
Why do you stir so early?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Sir,<lb/>
Our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea,<lb/>
Shook as the earth did quake;<lb/>
The very principals did seem to rend,<lb/>
And all-to topple: pure surprise and fear<lb/>
Made me to quit the house.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>That is the cause we trouble you so early;<lb/>
'Tis not our husbandry.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CERIMON</speaker>
<p>O, you say well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>But I much marvel that your lordship, having<lb/>
Rich tire about you, should at these early hours<lb/>
Shake off the golden slumber of repose.<lb/>
'Tis most strange,<lb/>
Nature should be so conversant with pain,<lb/>
Being thereto not compell'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CERIMON</speaker>
<p>I hold it ever,<lb/>
Virtue and cunning were endowments greater<lb/>
Than nobleness and riches: careless heirs<lb/>
May the two latter darken and expend;<lb/>
But immortality attends the former.<lb/>
Making a man a god. 'Tis known, I ever<lb/>
Have studied physic, through which secret art,<lb/>
By turning o'er authorities, I have,<lb/>
Together with my practise, made familiar<lb/>
To me and to my aid the blest infusions<lb/>
That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;<lb/>
And I can speak of the disturbances<lb/>
That nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me<lb/>
A more content in course of true delight<lb/>
Than to be thirsty after tottering honour,<lb/>
Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,<lb/>
To please the fool and death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth<lb/>
Your charity, and hundreds call themselves<lb/>
Your creatures, who by you have been restored:<lb/>
And not your knowledge, your personal pain, but even<lb/>
Your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon<lb/>
Such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter two or three Servants with a chest</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Servant</speaker>
<p>So; lift there.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CERIMON</speaker>
<p>What is that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Servant</speaker>
<p>Sir, even now<lb/>
Did the sea toss upon our shore this chest:<lb/>
'Tis of some wreck.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CERIMON</speaker>
<p>Set 't down, let's look upon't.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>'Tis like a coffin, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CERIMON</speaker>
<p>Whate'er it be,<lb/>
'Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight:<lb/>
If the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold,<lb/>
'Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>'Tis so, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CERIMON</speaker>
<p>How close 'tis caulk'd and bitumed!<lb/>
Did the sea cast it up?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Servant</speaker>
<p>I never saw so huge a billow, sir,<lb/>
As toss'd it upon shore.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CERIMON</speaker>
<p>Wrench it open;<lb/>
Soft! it smells most sweetly in my sense.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Gentleman</speaker>
<p>A delicate odour.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CERIMON</speaker>
<p>As ever hit my nostril. So, up with it.<lb/>
O you most potent gods! what's here? a corse!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Most strange!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CERIMON</speaker>

Apollo, perfect me in the characters!<lb/>

'Here I give to understand,<lb/>

I, King Pericles, have lost<lb/>
This queen, worth all our mundane cost.<lb/>

She was the daughter of a king:<lb/>
Besides this treasure for a fee,<lb/>
The gods requite his charity!'<lb/>

If thou livest, Pericles, thou hast a heart<lb/>

<p>Most likely, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CERIMON</speaker>
<p>Nay, certainly to-night;<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit a Servant</stage></p>


<p>
Death may usurp on nature many hours,<lb/>

Who was by good appliance recovered.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter a Servant, with boxes, napkins, and fire</stage></p>


<p>
Well said, well said; the fire and cloths.<lb/>
The rough and woeful music that we have,<lb/>
Cause it to sound, beseech you.<lb/>
The viol once more: how thou stirr'st, thou block!<lb/>
The music there!&mdash;I pray you, give her air.<lb/>
Gentlemen.<lb/>
This queen will live: nature awakes; a warmth<lb/>
Breathes out of her: she hath not been entranced<lb/>
Above five hours: see how she gins to blow<lb/>
Into life's flower again!<lb/>

Through you, increase our wonder and set up<lb/>
Your fame forever.<lb/>

Her eyelids, cases to those heavenly jewels<lb/>
Which Pericles hath lost,<lb/>
Begin to part their fringes of bright gold;<lb/>
The diamonds of a most praised water<lb/>
Do appear, to make the world twice rich. Live,<lb/>

Rare as you seem to be.<lb/>

In a litigious peace. You, and your lady,<lb/>

<p>Your shafts of fortune, though they hurt you mortally,<lb/>

<p>O your sweet queen!<lb/>
That the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither,<lb/>
To have bless'd mine eyes with her!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>We cannot but obey<lb/>
The powers above us. Could I rage and roar<lb/>
As doth the sea she lies in, yet the end<lb/>
Must be as 'tis. My gentle babe Marina, whom,<lb/>
For she was born at sea, I have named so, here<lb/>
I charge your charity withal, leaving her<lb/>
The infant of your care; beseeching you<lb/>
To give her princely training, that she may be<lb/>
Manner'd as she is born.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEON</speaker>
<p>Fear not, my lord, but think<lb/>
Your grace, that fed my country with your corn,<lb/>
For which the people's prayers still fall upon you,<lb/>
Must in your child be thought on. If neglection<lb/>
Should therein make me vile, the common body,<lb/>
By you relieved, would force me to my duty:<lb/>
But if to that my nature need a spur,<lb/>
The gods revenge it upon me and mine,<lb/>
To the end of generation!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>I believe you;<lb/>
Your honour and your goodness teach me to't,<lb/>

Unto Diana there a votaress.<lb/>
Now to Marina bend your mind,<lb/>
Whom our fast-growing scene must find<lb/>
At Tarsus, and by Cleon train'd<lb/>
In music, letters; who hath gain'd<lb/>
Of education all the grace,<lb/>
Which makes her both the heart and place<lb/>
Of general wonder. But, alack,<lb/>
That monster envy, oft the wrack<lb/>
Of earned praise, Marina's life<lb/>
Seeks to take off by treason's knife.<lb/>
And in this kind hath our Cleon<lb/>
One daughter, and a wench full grown,<lb/>
Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid<lb/>
Hight Philoten: and it is said<lb/>
For certain in our story, she<lb/>
Would ever with Marina be:<lb/>
Be't when she weaved the sleided silk<lb/>
With fingers long, small, white as milk;<lb/>
Or when she would with sharp needle wound<lb/>
The cambric, which she made more sound<lb/>
By hurting it; or when to the lute<lb/>
She sung, and made the night-bird mute,<lb/>
That still records with moan; or when<lb/>
She would with rich and constant pen<lb/>
Vail to her mistress Dian; still<lb/>
This Philoten contends in skill<lb/>
With absolute Marina: so<lb/>
With the dove of Paphos might the crow<lb/>
Vie feathers white. Marina gets<lb/>
All praises, which are paid as debts,<lb/>
And not as given. This so darks<lb/>
In Philoten all graceful marks,<lb/>
That Cleon's wife, with envy rare,<lb/>
A present murderer does prepare<lb/>
For good Marina, that her daughter<lb/>
Might stand peerless by this slaughter.<lb/>
The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,<lb/>
Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:<lb/>
And cursed Dionyza hath<lb/>
The pregnant instrument of wrath<lb/>
Prest for this blow. The unborn event<lb/>
I do commend to your content:<lb/>
Only I carry winged time<lb/>

Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken<lb/>
No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,<lb/>

<p>My father, as nurse said, did never fear,<lb/>
But cried 'Good seaman!' to the sailors, galling<lb/>
His kingly hands, haling ropes;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONINE</speaker>
<p>These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes;<lb/>
And they have seized Marina. Let her go:<lb/>
There's no hope she will return. I'll swear<lb/>
she's dead,<lb/>
And thrown into the sea. But I'll see further:<lb/>
Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,<lb/>
Not carry her aboard. If she remain,<lb/>
Whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.<lb/>

<p><stage>Mytilene. A room in a brothel.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULT</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>Pandar</speaker>
<p>Boult!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>Sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Pandar</speaker>
<p>Search the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of<lb/>
gallants. We lost too much money this mart by being<lb/>
too wenchless.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>We were never so much out of creatures. We have but<lb/>
poor three, and they can do no more than they can<lb/>
do; and they with continual action are even as good as rotten.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Pandar</speaker>
<p>Therefore let's have fresh ones, whate'er we pay for<lb/>
them. If there be not a conscience to be used in<lb/>
every trade, we shall never prosper.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>Thou sayest true: 'tis not our bringing up of poor<lb/>
bastards,&mdash;as, I think, I have brought up some eleven&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>Ay, to eleven; and brought them down again. But<lb/>
shall I search the market?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>What else, man? The stuff we have, a strong wind<lb/>
will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Pandar</speaker>
<p>Thou sayest true; they're too unwholesome, o'<lb/>
conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead, that<lb/>
lay with the little baggage.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>Ay, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat<lb/>
for worms. But I'll go search the market.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Pandar</speaker>
<p>Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a<lb/>
proportion to live quietly, and so give over.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>Why to give over, I pray you? is it a shame to get<lb/>
when we are old?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Pandar</speaker>
<p>O, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor<lb/>
the commodity wages not with the danger: therefore,<lb/>
if in our youths we could pick up some pretty<lb/>
estate, 'twere not amiss to keep our door hatched.<lb/>
Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods<lb/>
will be strong with us for giving over.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>Come, other sorts offend as well as we.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Pandar</speaker>
<p>As well as we! ay, and better too; we offend worse.<lb/>
Neither is our profession any trade; it's no<lb/>
calling. But here comes Boult.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter BOULT, with the Pirates and MARINA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p><stage>[To MARINA]</stage></p><p>  Come your ways. My masters, you say<lb/>
she's a virgin?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Pirate</speaker>
<p>O, sir, we doubt it not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>Master, I have gone through for this piece, you see:<lb/>
if you like her, so; if not, I have lost my earnest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>Boult, has she any qualities?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>She has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent<lb/>
good clothes: there's no further necessity of<lb/>
qualities can make her be refused.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>What's her price, Boult?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Pandar</speaker>
<p>Well, follow me, my masters, you shall have your<lb/>
money presently. Wife, take her in; instruct her<lb/>
what she has to do, that she may not be raw in her<lb/>
entertainment.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt Pandar and Pirates</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>Boult, take you the marks of her, the colour of her<lb/>
hair, complexion, height, age, with warrant of her<lb/>
virginity; and cry 'He that will give most shall<lb/>
have her first.' Such a maidenhead were no cheap<lb/>
thing, if men were as they have been. Get this done<lb/>
as I command you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>Performance shall follow.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>Alack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!<lb/>
He should have struck, not spoke; or that these pirates,<lb/>
Not enough barbarous, had not o'erboard thrown me<lb/>
For to seek my mother!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>Why lament you, pretty one?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>That I am pretty.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>Come, the gods have done their part in you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>I accuse them not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>You are light into my hands, where you are like to live.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>The more my fault<lb/>
To scape his hands where I was like to die.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>Ay, and you shall live in pleasure.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>No.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>Yes, indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all<lb/>
fashions: you shall fare well; you shall have the<lb/>
difference of all complexions. What! do you stop your ears?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>Are you a woman?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>What would you have me be, an I be not a woman?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>An honest woman, or not a woman.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>Marry, whip thee, gosling: I think I shall have<lb/>
something to do with you. Come, you're a young<lb/>
foolish sapling, and must be bowed as I would have<lb/>
you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>The gods defend me!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>If it please the gods to defend you by men, then men<lb/>
must comfort you, men must feed you, men must stir<lb/>
you up. Boult's returned.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter BOULT</stage></p>


<p>
Now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs;<lb/>
I have drawn her picture with my voice.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>And I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the<lb/>
inclination of the people, especially of the younger sort?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>'Faith, they listened to me as they would have<lb/>
hearkened to their father's testament. There was a<lb/>
Spaniard's mouth so watered, that he went to bed to<lb/>
her very description.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>We shall have him here to-morrow with his best ruff on.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>To-night, to-night. But, mistress, do you know the<lb/>
French knight that cowers i' the hams?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>Who, Monsieur Veroles?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>Ay, he: he offered to cut a caper at the<lb/>
proclamation; but he made a groan at it, and swore<lb/>
he would see her to-morrow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>Well, well; as for him, he brought his disease<lb/>
hither: here he does but repair it. I know he will<lb/>
come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the<lb/>
sun.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>Well, if we had of every nation a traveller, we<lb/>
should lodge them with this sign.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p><stage>[To MARINA]</stage></p><p>  Pray you, come hither awhile. You<lb/>
have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you must<lb/>
seem to do that fearfully which you commit<lb/>
willingly, despise profit where you have most gain.<lb/>
To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your<lb/>
lovers: seldom but that pity begets you a good<lb/>
opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>I understand you not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>O, take her home, mistress, take her home: these<lb/>
blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>Thou sayest true, i' faith, so they must; for your<lb/>
bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go<lb/>
with warrant.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>'Faith, some do, and some do not. But, mistress, if<lb/>
I have bargained for the joint,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>I may so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>Who should deny it? Come, young one, I like the<lb/>
manner of your garments well.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>Boult, spend thou that in the town: report what a<lb/>
sojourner we have; you'll lose nothing by custom.<lb/>
When nature flamed this piece, she meant thee a good<lb/>
turn; therefore say what a paragon she is, and thou<lb/>
hast the harvest out of thine own report.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake<lb/>
the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up<lb/>
the lewdly-inclined. I'll bring home some to-night.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>Come your ways; follow me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>If fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep,<lb/>
Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.<lb/>
Diana, aid my purpose!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>

<p><stage>Tarsus. A room in CLEON's house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter CLEON and DIONYZA</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>DIONYZA</speaker>
<p>Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEON</speaker>
<p>O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter<lb/>
The sun and moon ne'er look'd upon!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIONYZA</speaker>
<p>I think<lb/>
You'll turn a child again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEON</speaker>
<p>Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,<lb/>
I'ld give it to undo the deed. O lady,<lb/>
Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess<lb/>
To equal any single crown o' the earth<lb/>
I' the justice of compare! O villain Leonine!<lb/>
Whom thou hast poison'd too:<lb/>
If thou hadst drunk to him, 't had been a kindness<lb/>
Becoming well thy fact: what canst thou say<lb/>
When noble Pericles shall demand his child?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIONYZA</speaker>
<p>That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,<lb/>
To foster it, nor ever to preserve.<lb/>
She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?<lb/>
Unless you play the pious innocent,<lb/>
And for an honest attribute cry out<lb/>
'She died by foul play.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEON</speaker>
<p>O, go to. Well, well,<lb/>
Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods<lb/>
Do like this worst.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIONYZA</speaker>
<p>Be one of those that think<lb/>
The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,<lb/>
And open this to Pericles. I do shame<lb/>
To think of what a noble strain you are,<lb/>
And of how coward a spirit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEON</speaker>
<p>To such proceeding<lb/>
Who ever but his approbation added,<lb/>
Though not his prime consent, he did not flow<lb/>
From honourable sources.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIONYZA</speaker>
<p>Be it so, then:<lb/>
Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,<lb/>
Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.<lb/>
She did disdain my child, and stood between<lb/>
Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,<lb/>
But cast their gazes on Marina's face;<lb/>
Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin<lb/>
Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through;<lb/>
And though you call my course unnatural,<lb/>
You not your child well loving, yet I find<lb/>
It greets me as an enterprise of kindness<lb/>
Perform'd to your sole daughter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEON</speaker>
<p>Heavens forgive it!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIONYZA</speaker>
<p>And as for Pericles,<lb/>
What should he say? We wept after her hearse,<lb/>
And yet we mourn: her monument<lb/>
Is almost finish'd, and her epitaphs<lb/>
In glittering golden characters express<lb/>
A general praise to her, and care in us<lb/>
At whose expense 'tis done.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLEON</speaker>
<p>Thou art like the harpy,<lb/>
Which, to betray, dost, with thine angel's face,<lb/>
Seize with thine eagle's talons.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIONYZA</speaker>
<p>You are like one that superstitiously<lb/>
Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies:<lb/>
But yet I know you'll do as I advise.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOWER</speaker>
<p>Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short;<lb/>
Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for't;<lb/>
Making, to take your imagination,<lb/>
From bourn to bourn, region to region.<lb/>
By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime<lb/>
To use one language in each several clime<lb/>
Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you<lb/>
To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,<lb/>
The stages of our story. Pericles<lb/>
Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,<lb/>
Attended on by many a lord and knight.<lb/>
To see his daughter, all his life's delight.<lb/>
Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late<lb/>
Advanced in time to great and high estate,<lb/>
Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,<lb/>
Old Helicanus goes along behind.<lb/>
Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought<lb/>
This king to Tarsus,&mdash;think his pilot thought;<lb/>
So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,&mdash;<lb/>
To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.<lb/>
Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;<lb/>
Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.<lb/>

DUMB SHOW.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter PERICLES, at one door, with all his train;	CLEON and DIONYZA, at the other. CLEON shows	PERICLES the tomb; whereat PERICLES makes	lamentation, puts on sackcloth, and in a mighty	passion departs. Then exeunt CLEON and DIONYZA</stage></p>


<p>
See how belief may suffer by foul show!<lb/>
This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;<lb/>
And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,<lb/>
With sighs shot through, and biggest tears<lb/>
o'ershower'd,<lb/>
Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears<lb/>
Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:<lb/>
He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears<lb/>
A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,<lb/>
And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.<lb/>
The epitaph is for Marina writ<lb/>
By wicked Dionyza.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument</stage></p>


<p>
'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,<lb/>
Who wither'd in her spring of year.<lb/>
She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,<lb/>
On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;<lb/>
Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,<lb/>
Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:<lb/>
Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,<lb/>
Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:<lb/>
Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,<lb/>
Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'<lb/>

No visor does become black villany<lb/>
So well as soft and tender flattery.<lb/>
Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,<lb/>
And bear his courses to be ordered<lb/>
By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play<lb/>
His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day<lb/>
In her unholy service. Patience, then,<lb/>

<p>Fie, fie upon her! she's able to freeze the god<lb/>
Priapus, and undo a whole generation. We must<lb/>

creature of sale.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>Do you know this house to be a place of such resort,<lb/>
and will come into 't? I hear say you are of<lb/>
honourable parts, and are the governor of this place.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>Why, hath your principal made known unto you who I am?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>Who is my principal?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>Why, your herb-woman; she that sets seeds and roots<lb/>
of shame and iniquity. O, you have heard something<lb/>
of my power, and so stand aloof for more serious<lb/>
wooing. But I protest to thee, pretty one, my<lb/>
authority shall not see thee, or else look friendly<lb/>
upon thee. Come, bring me to some private place:<lb/>
come, come.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>If you were born to honour, show it now;<lb/>
If put upon you, make the judgment good<lb/>
That thought you worthy of it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>How's this? how's this? Some more; be sage.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>For me,<lb/>
That am a maid, though most ungentle fortune<lb/>
Have placed me in this sty, where, since I came,<lb/>
Diseases have been sold dearer than physic,<lb/>
O, that the gods<lb/>
Would set me free from this unhallow'd place,<lb/>
Though they did change me to the meanest bird<lb/>
That flies i' the purer air!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>I did not think<lb/>
Thou couldst have spoke so well; ne'er dream'd thou couldst.<lb/>
Had I brought hither a corrupted mind,<lb/>
Thy speech had alter'd it. Hold, here's gold for thee:<lb/>
Persever in that clear way thou goest,<lb/>
And the gods strengthen thee!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>The good gods preserve you!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>For me, be you thoughten<lb/>
That I came with no ill intent; for to me<lb/>
The very doors and windows savour vilely.<lb/>
Fare thee well. Thou art a piece of virtue, and<lb/>
I doubt not but thy training hath been noble.<lb/>
Hold, here's more gold for thee.<lb/>
A curse upon him, die he like a thief,<lb/>
That robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dost<lb/>
Hear from me, it shall be for thy good.<lb/>

<p>I beseech your honour, one piece for me.<lb/>

Would sink and overwhelm you. Away!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>How's this? We must take another course with you.<lb/>
If your peevish chastity, which is not worth a<lb/>
breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope,<lb/>
shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded like<lb/>
a spaniel. Come your ways.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>Whither would you have me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>I must have your maidenhead taken off, or the common<lb/>
hangman shall execute it. Come your ways. We'll<lb/>
have no more gentlemen driven away. Come your ways, I say.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>How now! what's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>Worse and worse, mistress; she has here spoken holy<lb/>
words to the Lord Lysimachus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>O abominable!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>She makes our profession as it were to stink afore<lb/>
the face of the gods.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>Marry, hang her up for ever!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>The nobleman would have dealt with her like a<lb/>
nobleman, and she sent him away as cold as a<lb/>
snowball; saying his prayers too.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>Boult, take her away; use her at thy pleasure:<lb/>
crack the glass of her virginity, and make the rest malleable.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Bawd</speaker>
<p>She conjures: away with her! Would she had never<lb/>
come within my doors! Marry, hang you! She's born<lb/>
to undo us. Will you not go the way of women-kind?<lb/>
Marry, come up, my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>Come, mistress; come your ways with me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>Whither wilt thou have me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>Prithee, tell me one thing first.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>Come now, your one thing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>What canst thou wish thine enemy to be?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>Why, I could wish him to be my master, or rather, my mistress.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>Neither of these are so bad as thou art,<lb/>
Since they do better thee in their command.<lb/>
Thou hold'st a place, for which the pained'st fiend<lb/>
Of hell would not in reputation change:<lb/>
Thou art the damned doorkeeper to every<lb/>
Coistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib;<lb/>
To the choleric fisting of every rogue<lb/>
Thy ear is liable; thy food is such<lb/>
As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>What would you have me do? go to the wars, would<lb/>
you? where a man may serve seven years for the loss<lb/>
of a leg, and have not money enough in the end to<lb/>
buy him a wooden one?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>Do any thing but this thou doest. Empty<lb/>
OLD receptacles, or common shores, of filth;<lb/>
Serve by indenture to the common hangman:<lb/>
Any of these ways are yet better than this;<lb/>
For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,<lb/>
Would own a name too dear. O, that the gods<lb/>
Would safely deliver me from this place!<lb/>
Here, here's gold for thee.<lb/>
If that thy master would gain by thee,<lb/>
Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,<lb/>
With other virtues, which I'll keep from boast:<lb/>
And I will undertake all these to teach.<lb/>
I doubt not but this populous city will<lb/>
Yield many scholars.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>But can you teach all this you speak of?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>Prove that I cannot, take me home again,<lb/>
And prostitute me to the basest groom<lb/>
That doth frequent your house.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>Well, I will see what I can do for thee: if I can<lb/>
place thee, I will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>But amongst honest women.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BOULT</speaker>
<p>'Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them.<lb/>
But since my master and mistress have bought you,<lb/>
there's no going but by their consent: therefore I<lb/>
will make them acquainted with your purpose, and I<lb/>
doubt not but I shall find them tractable enough.<lb/>
Come, I'll do for thee what I can; come your ways.<lb/>

<p>Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chances<lb/>
Into an honest house, our story says.<lb/>
She sings like one immortal, and she dances<lb/>
As goddess-like to her admired lays;<lb/>
Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her needle composes<lb/>
Nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,<lb/>
That even her art sisters the natural roses;<lb/>
Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry:<lb/>
That pupils lacks she none of noble race,<lb/>
Who pour their bounty on her; and her gain<lb/>
She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place;<lb/>
And to her father turn our thoughts again,<lb/>
Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost;<lb/>
Whence, driven before the winds, he is arrived<lb/>
Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast<lb/>
Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived<lb/>
God Neptune's annual feast to keep: from whence<lb/>
Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,<lb/>
His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;<lb/>
And to him in his barge with fervor hies.<lb/>
In your supposing once more put your sight<lb/>
Of heavy Pericles; think this his bark:<lb/>
Where what is done in action, more, if might,<lb/>
Shall be discover'd; please you, sit and hark.<lb/>

<p><stage>On board PERICLES' ship, off Mytilene. A close pavilion on deck, with a curtain before it; PERICLES within it, reclined on a couch. A barge lying beside the Tyrian vessel.</stage></p>



<p><stage>Enter two Sailors, one belonging to the Tyrian	vessel, the other to the barge; to them HELICANUS</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>Tyrian Sailor</speaker>
<p><stage>[To the Sailor of Mytilene]</stage></p><p>  Where is lord Helicanus?<lb/>
he can resolve you.<lb/>
O, here he is.<lb/>
Sir, there's a barge put off from Mytilene,<lb/>
And in it is Lysimachus the governor,<lb/>
Who craves to come aboard. What is your will?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>That he have his. Call up some gentlemen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tyrian Sailor</speaker>
<p>Ho, gentlemen! my lord calls.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter two or three Gentlemen</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Gentleman</speaker>
<p>Doth your lordship call?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>Gentlemen, there's some of worth would come aboard;<lb/>
I pray ye, greet them fairly.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>The Gentlemen and the two Sailors descend, and go	on board the barge</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter, from thence, LYSIMACHUS and Lords; with the	Gentlemen and the two Sailors</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Tyrian Sailor</speaker>
<p>Sir,<lb/>
This is the man that can, in aught you would,<lb/>
Resolve you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>Hail, reverend sir! the gods preserve you!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>And you, sir, to outlive the age I am,<lb/>
And die as I would do.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>You wish me well.<lb/>
Being on shore, honouring of Neptune's triumphs,<lb/>
Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us,<lb/>
I made to it, to know of whence you are.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>First, what is your place?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>I am the governor of this place you lie before.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>Sir,<lb/>
Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the king;<lb/>
A man who for this three months hath not spoken<lb/>
To any one, nor taken sustenance<lb/>
But to prorogue his grief.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>Upon what ground is his distemperature?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>'Twould be too tedious to repeat;<lb/>
But the main grief springs from the loss<lb/>
Of a beloved daughter and a wife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>May we not see him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>You may;<lb/>
But bootless is your sight: he will not speak To any.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>Yet let me obtain my wish.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>Behold him.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>PERICLES discovered</stage></p>


<p>
This was a goodly person,<lb/>
Till the disaster that, one mortal night,<lb/>
Drove him to this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>Sir king, all hail! the gods preserve you!<lb/>
Hail, royal sir!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>It is in vain; he will not speak to you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Lord</speaker>
<p>Sir,<lb/>
We have a maid in Mytilene, I durst wager,<lb/>
Would win some words of him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>'Tis well bethought.<lb/>
She questionless with her sweet harmony<lb/>
And other chosen attractions, would allure,<lb/>
And make a battery through his deafen'd parts,<lb/>
Which now are midway stopp'd:<lb/>
She is all happy as the fairest of all,<lb/>
And, with her fellow maids is now upon<lb/>
The leafy shelter that abuts against<lb/>
The island's side.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Whispers a Lord, who goes off in the barge of	LYSIMACHUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>Sure, all's effectless; yet nothing we'll omit<lb/>
That bears recovery's name. But, since your kindness<lb/>
We have stretch'd thus far, let us beseech you<lb/>
That for our gold we may provision have,<lb/>
Wherein we are not destitute for want,<lb/>
But weary for the staleness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>O, sir, a courtesy<lb/>
Which if we should deny, the most just gods<lb/>
For every graff would send a caterpillar,<lb/>
And so afflict our province. Yet once more<lb/>
Let me entreat to know at large the cause<lb/>
Of your king's sorrow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>Sit, sir, I will recount it to you:<lb/>
But, see, I am prevented.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter, from the barge, Lord, with MARINA, and a	young Lady</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>O, here is<lb/>
The lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one!<lb/>
Is't not a goodly presence?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>She's a gallant lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>She's such a one, that, were I well assured<lb/>
Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,<lb/>
I'ld wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed.<lb/>
Fair one, all goodness that consists in bounty<lb/>
Expect even here, where is a kingly patient:<lb/>
If that thy prosperous and artificial feat<lb/>
Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,<lb/>
Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay<lb/>
As thy desires can wish.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>Sir, I will use<lb/>
My utmost skill in his recovery, Provided<lb/>
That none but I and my companion maid<lb/>
Be suffer'd to come near him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>Come, let us leave her;<lb/>
And the gods make her prosperous!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>Mark'd he your music?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>No, nor look'd on us.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>See, she will speak to him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>Hail, sir! my lord, lend ear.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Hum, ha!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>I am a maid,<lb/>
My lord, that ne'er before invited eyes,<lb/>
But have been gazed on like a comet: she speaks,<lb/>
My lord, that, may be, hath endured a grief<lb/>
Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh'd.<lb/>
Though wayward fortune did malign my state,<lb/>
My derivation was from ancestors<lb/>
Who stood equivalent with mighty kings:<lb/>
But time hath rooted out my parentage,<lb/>
And to the world and awkward casualties<lb/>
Bound me in servitude.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
I will desist;<lb/>
But there is something glows upon my cheek,<lb/>
And whispers in mine ear, 'Go not till he speak.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>My fortunes&mdash;parentage&mdash;good parentage&mdash;<lb/>
To equal mine!&mdash;was it not thus? what say you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage,<lb/>
You would not do me violence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me.<lb/>
You are like something that&mdash;What country-woman?<lb/>
Here of these shores?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>No, nor of any shores:<lb/>
Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am<lb/>
No other than I appear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.<lb/>
My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one<lb/>
My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;<lb/>
Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;<lb/>
As silver-voiced; her eyes as jewel-like<lb/>
And cased as richly; in pace another Juno;<lb/>
Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,<lb/>
The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>Where I am but a stranger: from the deck<lb/>
You may discern the place.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Where were you bred?<lb/>
And how achieved you these endowments, which<lb/>
You make more rich to owe?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>If I should tell my history, it would seem<lb/>
Like lies disdain'd in the reporting.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Prithee, speak:<lb/>
Falseness cannot come from thee; for thou look'st<lb/>
Modest as Justice, and thou seem'st a palace<lb/>
For the crown'd Truth to dwell in: I will<lb/>
believe thee,<lb/>
And make my senses credit thy relation<lb/>
To points that seem impossible; for thou look'st<lb/>
Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?<lb/>
Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back&mdash;<lb/>
Which was when I perceived thee&mdash;that thou camest<lb/>
From good descending?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>So indeed I did.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Report thy parentage. I think thou said'st<lb/>
Thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury,<lb/>
And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,<lb/>
If both were open'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>Some such thing<lb/>
I said, and said no more but what my thoughts<lb/>
Did warrant me was likely.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Tell thy story;<lb/>
If thine consider'd prove the thousandth part<lb/>
Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I<lb/>
Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look<lb/>
Like Patience gazing on kings' graves, and smiling<lb/>
Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?<lb/>
How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?<lb/>
Recount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>My name is Marina.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>O, I am mock'd,<lb/>
And thou by some incensed god sent hither<lb/>
To make the world to laugh at me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>Patience, good sir,<lb/>
Or here I'll cease.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Nay, I'll be patient.<lb/>
Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me,<lb/>
To call thyself Marina.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>The name<lb/>
Was given me by one that had some power,<lb/>
My father, and a king.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>How! a king's daughter?<lb/>
And call'd Marina?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>You said you would believe me;<lb/>
But, not to be a troubler of your peace,<lb/>
I will end here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>But are you flesh and blood?<lb/>
Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?<lb/>
Motion! Well; speak on. Where were you born?<lb/>
And wherefore call'd Marina?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>Call'd Marina<lb/>
For I was born at sea.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>At sea! what mother?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>My mother was the daughter of a king;<lb/>
Who died the minute I was born,<lb/>
As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft<lb/>
Deliver'd weeping.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>O, stop there a little!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Aside</stage></p>


<p>
This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep<lb/>
Did mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:<lb/>
My daughter's buried. Well: where were you bred?<lb/>
I'll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,<lb/>
And never interrupt you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>You scorn: believe me, 'twere best I did give o'er.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>I will believe you by the syllable<lb/>
Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave:<lb/>
How came you in these parts? where were you bred?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>The king my father did in Tarsus leave me;<lb/>
Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,<lb/>
Did seek to murder me: and having woo'd<lb/>
A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do't,<lb/>
A crew of pirates came and rescued me;<lb/>
Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,<lb/>
Whither will you have me? Why do you weep?<lb/>
It may be,<lb/>
You think me an impostor: no, good faith;<lb/>
I am the daughter to King Pericles,<lb/>
If good King Pericles be.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Ho, Helicanus!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>Calls my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Thou art a grave and noble counsellor,<lb/>
Most wise in general: tell me, if thou canst,<lb/>
What this maid is, or what is like to be,<lb/>
That thus hath made me weep?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>I know not; but<lb/>
Here is the regent, sir, of Mytilene<lb/>
Speaks nobly of her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>She would never tell<lb/>
Her parentage; being demanded that,<lb/>
She would sit still and weep.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>O Helicanus, strike me, honour'd sir;<lb/>
Give me a gash, put me to present pain;<lb/>
Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me<lb/>
O'erbear the shores of my mortality,<lb/>
And drown me with their sweetness. O, come hither,<lb/>
Thou that beget'st him that did thee beget;<lb/>
Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,<lb/>
And found at sea again! O Helicanus,<lb/>
Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud<lb/>
As thunder threatens us: this is Marina.<lb/>
What was thy mother's name? tell me but that,<lb/>
For truth can never be confirm'd enough,<lb/>
Though doubts did ever sleep.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>First, sir, I pray,<lb/>
What is your title?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now<lb/>
My drown'd queen's name, as in the rest you said<lb/>
Thou hast been godlike perfect,<lb/>
The heir of kingdoms and another like<lb/>
To Pericles thy father.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>Is it no more to be your daughter than<lb/>
To say my mother's name was Thaisa?<lb/>
Thaisa was my mother, who did end<lb/>
The minute I began.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child.<lb/>
Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus;<lb/>
She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,<lb/>
By savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all;<lb/>
When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge<lb/>
She is thy very princess. Who is this?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>Sir, 'tis the governor of Mytilene,<lb/>
Who, hearing of your melancholy state,<lb/>
Did come to see you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>I embrace you.<lb/>
Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.<lb/>
O heavens bless my girl! But, hark, what music?<lb/>
Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him<lb/>
O'er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,<lb/>
How sure you are my daughter. But, what music?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>My lord, I hear none.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>None!<lb/>
The music of the spheres! List, my Marina.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>It is not good to cross him; give him way.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Rarest sounds! Do ye not hear?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>My lord, I hear.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Music</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Most heavenly music!<lb/>
It nips me unto listening, and thick slumber<lb/>
Hangs upon mine eyes: let me rest.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Sleeps</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>A pillow for his head:<lb/>
So, leave him all. Well, my companion friends,<lb/>
If this but answer to my just belief,<lb/>
I'll well remember you.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but PERICLES</stage>



</p><p><stage>DIANA appears to PERICLES as in a vision</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIANA</speaker>
<p>My temple stands in Ephesus: hie thee thither,<lb/>
And do upon mine altar sacrifice.<lb/>
There, when my maiden priests are met together,<lb/>
Before the people all,<lb/>
Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:<lb/>
To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter's, call<lb/>
And give them repetition to the life.<lb/>
Or perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe;<lb/>
Do it, and happy; by my silver bow!<lb/>
Awake, and tell thy dream.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Disappears</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Celestial Dian, goddess argentine,<lb/>
I will obey thee. Helicanus!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter HELICANUS, LYSIMACHUS, and MARINA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>Sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike<lb/>
The inhospitable Cleon; but I am<lb/>
For other service first: toward Ephesus<lb/>
Turn our blown sails; eftsoons I'll tell thee why.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To LYSIMACHUS</stage>


</p><p>
Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore,<lb/>
And give you gold for such provision<lb/>
As our intents will need?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>Sir,<lb/>
With all my heart; and, when you come ashore,<lb/>
I have another suit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>You shall prevail,<lb/>
Were it to woo my daughter; for it seems<lb/>
You have been noble towards her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LYSIMACHUS</speaker>
<p>Sir, lend me your arm.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Come, my Marina.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter GOWER, before the temple of DIANA at Ephesus</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOWER</speaker>
<p>Now our sands are almost run;<lb/>
More a little, and then dumb.<lb/>
This, my last boon, give me,<lb/>
For such kindness must relieve me,<lb/>
That you aptly will suppose<lb/>
What pageantry, what feats, what shows,<lb/>
What minstrelsy, and pretty din,<lb/>
The regent made in Mytilene<lb/>
To greet the king. So he thrived,<lb/>
That he is promised to be wived<lb/>
To fair Marina; but in no wise<lb/>
Till he had done his sacrifice,<lb/>
As Dian bade: whereto being bound,<lb/>
The interim, pray you, all confound.<lb/>
In feather'd briefness sails are fill'd,<lb/>
And wishes fall out as they're will'd.<lb/>
At Ephesus, the temple see,<lb/>
Our king and all his company.<lb/>
That he can hither come so soon,<lb/>
Is by your fancy's thankful doom.<lb/>

<head>Scene 3</head>

<p><stage>The temple of Diana at Ephesus; THAISA standing near the altar, as high priestess; a number of Virgins on each side; CERIMON and other Inhabitants of Ephesus attending.</stage></p>



<p><stage>Enter PERICLES, with his train; LYSIMACHUS,	HELICANUS, MARINA, and a Lady</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,<lb/>
I here confess myself the king of Tyre;<lb/>
Who, frighted from my country, did wed<lb/>
At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.<lb/>
At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth<lb/>
A maid-child call'd Marina; who, O goddess,<lb/>
Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus<lb/>
Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years<lb/>
He sought to murder: but her better stars<lb/>
Brought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shore<lb/>
Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,<lb/>
Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she<lb/>
Made known herself my daughter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>Voice and favour!<lb/>
You are, you are&mdash;O royal Pericles!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Faints</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>What means the nun? she dies! help, gentlemen!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CERIMON</speaker>
<p>Noble sir,<lb/>
If you have told Diana's altar true,<lb/>
This is your wife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Reverend appearer, no;<lb/>
I threw her overboard with these very arms.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CERIMON</speaker>
<p>Upon this coast, I warrant you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>'Tis most certain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CERIMON</speaker>
<p>Look to the lady; O, she's but o'erjoy'd.<lb/>
Early in blustering morn this lady was<lb/>
Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,<lb/>
Found there rich jewels; recover'd her, and placed her<lb/>
Here in Diana's temple.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>May we see them?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CERIMON</speaker>
<p>Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,<lb/>
Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is recovered.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>O, let me look!<lb/>
If he be none of mine, my sanctity<lb/>
Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,<lb/>
But curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord,<lb/>
Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake,<lb/>
Like him you are: did you not name a tempest,<lb/>
A birth, and death?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>The voice of dead Thaisa!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>That Thaisa am I, supposed dead<lb/>
And drown'd.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Immortal Dian!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>Now I know you better.<lb/>
When we with tears parted Pentapolis,<lb/>
The king my father gave you such a ring.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Shows a ring</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>This, this: no more, you gods! your present kindness<lb/>
Makes my past miseries sports: you shall do well,<lb/>
That on the touching of her lips I may<lb/>
Melt and no more be seen. O, come, be buried<lb/>
A second time within these arms.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARINA</speaker>
<p>My heart<lb/>
Leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Kneels to THAISA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Look, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa;<lb/>
Thy burden at the sea, and call'd Marina<lb/>
For she was yielded there.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>Blest, and mine own!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELICANUS</speaker>
<p>Hail, madam, and my queen!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>I know you not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre,<lb/>
I left behind an ancient substitute:<lb/>
Can you remember what I call'd the man?<lb/>
I have named him oft.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>'Twas Helicanus then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Still confirmation:<lb/>
Embrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he.<lb/>
Now do I long to hear how you were found;<lb/>
How possibly preserved; and who to thank,<lb/>
Besides the gods, for this great miracle.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man,<lb/>
Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can<lb/>
From first to last resolve you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Reverend sir,<lb/>
The gods can have no mortal officer<lb/>
More like a god than you. Will you deliver<lb/>
How this dead queen re-lives?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CERIMON</speaker>
<p>I will, my lord.<lb/>
Beseech you, first go with me to my house,<lb/>
Where shall be shown you all was found with her;<lb/>
How she came placed here in the temple;<lb/>
No needful thing omitted.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Pure Dian, bless thee for thy vision! I<lb/>
Will offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa,<lb/>
This prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter,<lb/>
Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now,<lb/>
This ornament<lb/>
Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;<lb/>
And what this fourteen years no razor touch'd,<lb/>
To grace thy marriage-day, I'll beautify.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THAISA</speaker>
<p>Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,<lb/>
My father's dead.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PERICLES</speaker>
<p>Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,<lb/>
We'll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves<lb/>
Will in that kingdom spend our following days:<lb/>
Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.<lb/>
Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay<lb/>
To hear the rest untold: sir, lead's the way.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter GOWER</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>GOWER</speaker>
<p>In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard<lb/>
Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:<lb/>
In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,<lb/>
Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,<lb/>
Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,<lb/>
Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last:<lb/>
In Helicanus may you well descry<lb/>
A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:<lb/>
In reverend Cerimon there well appears<lb/>
The worth that learned charity aye wears:<lb/>
For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame<lb/>
Had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name<lb/>
Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,<lb/>
That him and his they in his palace burn;<lb/>
The gods for murder seemed so content<lb/>
To punish them; although not done, but meant.<lb/>
So, on your patience evermore attending,<lb/>
New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.<lb/>
