<p><stage>Before LEONATO'S house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a	Messenger</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon<lb/>
comes this night to Messina.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off<lb/>
when I left him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>But few of any sort, and none of name.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings<lb/>
home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath<lb/>
bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by<lb/>
Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the<lb/>
promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,<lb/>
the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better<lb/>
bettered expectation than you must expect of me to<lb/>
tell you how.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much<lb/>
glad of it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>I have already delivered him letters, and there<lb/>
appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could<lb/>
not show itself modest enough without a badge of<lb/>
bitterness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Did he break out into tears?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>In great measure.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces<lb/>
truer than those that are so washed. How much<lb/>
better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the<lb/>
wars or no?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>I know none of that name, lady: there was none such<lb/>
in the army of any sort.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>What is he that you ask for, niece?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged<lb/>
Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading<lb/>
the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged<lb/>
him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he<lb/>
killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath<lb/>
he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;<lb/>
but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:<lb/>
he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an<lb/>
excellent stomach.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>And a good soldier too, lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all<lb/>
honourable virtues.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:<lb/>
but for the stuffing,&mdash;well, we are all mortal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a<lb/>
kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:<lb/>
they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit<lb/>
between them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last<lb/>
conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and<lb/>
now is the whole man governed with one: so that if<lb/>
he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him<lb/>
bear it for a difference between himself and his<lb/>
horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,<lb/>
to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his<lb/>
companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Is't possible?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as<lb/>
the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the<lb/>
next block.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray<lb/>
you, who is his companion? Is there no young<lb/>
squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he<lb/>
is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker<lb/>
runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if<lb/>
he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a<lb/>
thousand pound ere a' be cured.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>I will hold friends with you, lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Do, good friend.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>You will never run mad, niece.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>No, not till a hot January.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>Don Pedro is approached.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK,	and BALTHASAR</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your<lb/>
trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid<lb/>
cost, and you encounter it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of<lb/>
your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should<lb/>
remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides<lb/>
and happiness takes his leave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this<lb/>
is your daughter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Her mother hath many times told me so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this<lb/>
what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers<lb/>
herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an<lb/>
honourable father.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not<lb/>
have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as<lb/>
like him as she is.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior<lb/>
Benedick: nobody marks you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Is it possible disdain should die while she hath<lb/>
such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?<lb/>
Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come<lb/>
in her presence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I<lb/>
am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I<lb/>
would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard<lb/>
heart; for, truly, I love none.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>A dear happiness to women: they would else have<lb/>
been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God<lb/>
and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I<lb/>
had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man<lb/>
swear he loves me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some<lb/>
gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate<lb/>
scratched face.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such<lb/>
a face as yours were.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and<lb/>
so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's<lb/>
name; I have done.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio<lb/>
and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath<lb/>
invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at<lb/>
the least a month; and he heartily prays some<lb/>
occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no<lb/>
hypocrite, but prays from his heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>To DON JOHN</stage></p>


<p>
Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to<lb/>
the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank<lb/>
you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Please it your grace lead on?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>I noted her not; but I looked on her.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Is she not a modest young lady?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for<lb/>
my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak<lb/>
after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high<lb/>
praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little<lb/>
for a great praise: only this commendation I can<lb/>
afford her, that were she other than she is, she<lb/>
were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I<lb/>
do not like her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me<lb/>
truly how thou likest her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Can the world buy such a jewel?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this<lb/>
with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,<lb/>
to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a<lb/>
rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take<lb/>
you, to go in the song?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I<lb/>
looked on.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such<lb/>
matter: there's her cousin, an she were not<lb/>
possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty<lb/>
as the first of May doth the last of December. But I<lb/>
hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the<lb/>
contrary, if Hero would be my wife.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world<lb/>
one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?<lb/>
Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?<lb/>
Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck<lb/>
into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away<lb/>
Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter DON PEDRO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>What secret hath held you here, that you followed<lb/>
not to Leonato's?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>I would your grace would constrain me to tell.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>I charge thee on thy allegiance.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb<lb/>
man; I would have you think so; but, on my<lb/>
allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is<lb/>
in love. With who? now that is your grace's part.<lb/>
Mark how short his answer is;&mdash;With Hero, Leonato's<lb/>
short daughter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>If this were so, so were it uttered.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor<lb/>
'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be<lb/>
so.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it<lb/>
should be otherwise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>By my troth, I speak my thought.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>That I love her, I feel.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>That she is worthy, I know.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>That I neither feel how she should be loved nor<lb/>
know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that<lb/>
fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite<lb/>
of beauty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>And never could maintain his part but in the force<lb/>
of his will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she<lb/>
brought me up, I likewise give her most humble<lb/>
thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my<lb/>
forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,<lb/>
all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do<lb/>
them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the<lb/>
right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which<lb/>
I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,<lb/>
not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood<lb/>
with love than I will get again with drinking, pick<lb/>
out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me<lb/>
up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of<lb/>
blind Cupid.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou<lb/>
wilt prove a notable argument.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot<lb/>
at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on<lb/>
the shoulder, and called Adam.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull<lb/>
doth bear the yoke.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible<lb/>
Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set<lb/>
them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,<lb/>
and in such great letters as they write 'Here is<lb/>
good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign<lb/>
'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in<lb/>
Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>I look for an earthquake too, then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Well, you temporize with the hours. In the<lb/>
meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to<lb/>
Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will<lb/>
not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made<lb/>
great preparation.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>I have almost matter enough in me for such an<lb/>
embassage; and so I commit you&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>To the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>The sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your<lb/>
discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and<lb/>
the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere<lb/>
you flout old ends any further, examine your<lb/>
conscience: and so I leave you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>My liege, your highness now may do me good.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,<lb/>
And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn<lb/>
Any hard lesson that may do thee good.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Hath Leonato any son, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>No child but Hero; she's his only heir.<lb/>
Dost thou affect her, Claudio?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>O, my lord,<lb/>
When you went onward on this ended action,<lb/>
I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,<lb/>
That liked, but had a rougher task in hand<lb/>
Than to drive liking to the name of love:<lb/>
But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts<lb/>
Have left their places vacant, in their rooms<lb/>
Come thronging soft and delicate desires,<lb/>
All prompting me how fair young Hero is,<lb/>
Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Thou wilt be like a lover presently<lb/>
And tire the hearer with a book of words.<lb/>
If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,<lb/>
And I will break with her and with her father,<lb/>
And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end<lb/>
That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>How sweetly you do minister to love,<lb/>
That know love's grief by his complexion!<lb/>
But lest my liking might too sudden seem,<lb/>
I would have salved it with a longer treatise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>What need the bridge much broader than the flood?<lb/>
The fairest grant is the necessity.<lb/>
Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest,<lb/>
And I will fit thee with the remedy.<lb/>
I know we shall have revelling to-night:<lb/>
I will assume thy part in some disguise<lb/>
And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,<lb/>
And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart<lb/>
And take her hearing prisoner with the force<lb/>
And strong encounter of my amorous tale:<lb/>
Then after to her father will I break;<lb/>
And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.<lb/>
In practise let us put it presently.<lb/>

<p><stage>A room in LEONATO's house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, meeting</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son?<lb/>
hath he provided this music?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell<lb/>
you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Are they good?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>As the event stamps them: but they have a good<lb/>
cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count<lb/>
Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine<lb/>
orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:<lb/>
the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my<lb/>
niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it<lb/>
this night in a dance: and if he found her<lb/>
accordant, he meant to take the present time by the<lb/>
top and instantly break with you of it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and<lb/>
question him yourself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear<lb/>
itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,<lb/>
that she may be the better prepared for an answer,<lb/>
if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter Attendants</stage></p>


<p>
Cousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry you<lb/>
mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your<lb/>
skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>



</p></div2><div2 type="scene" n="3" id="d8">
<head>Scene 3</head>

<p><stage>The same.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter DON JOHN and CONRADE</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>CONRADE</speaker>
<p>What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out<lb/>
of measure sad?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>There is no measure in the occasion that breeds;<lb/>
therefore the sadness is without limit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONRADE</speaker>
<p>You should hear reason.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONRADE</speaker>
<p>If not a present remedy, at least a patient<lb/>
sufferance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art,<lb/>
born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral<lb/>
medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide<lb/>
what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile<lb/>
at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait<lb/>
for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and<lb/>
tend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry and<lb/>
claw no man in his humour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONRADE</speaker>
<p>Yea, but you must not make the full show of this<lb/>
till you may do it without controlment. You have of<lb/>
late stood out against your brother, and he hath<lb/>
ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is<lb/>
impossible you should take true root but by the<lb/>
fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful<lb/>
that you frame the season for your own harvest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in<lb/>
his grace, and it better fits my blood to be<lb/>
disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob<lb/>
love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to<lb/>
be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied<lb/>
but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with<lb/>
a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I<lb/>
have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my<lb/>
mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do<lb/>
my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and<lb/>
seek not to alter me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONRADE</speaker>
<p>Can you make no use of your discontent?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>I make all use of it, for I use it only.<lb/>
Who comes here?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter BORACHIO</stage></p>


<p>
What news, Borachio?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>I came yonder from a great supper: the prince your<lb/>
brother is royally entertained by Leonato: and I<lb/>
can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?<lb/>
What is he for a fool that betroths himself to<lb/>
unquietness?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Marry, it is your brother's right hand.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>Who? the most exquisite Claudio?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Even he.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks<lb/>
he?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a<lb/>
musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand<lb/>
in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the<lb/>
arras; and there heard it agreed upon that the<lb/>
prince should woo Hero for himself, and having<lb/>
obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>Come, come, let us thither: this may prove food to<lb/>
my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the<lb/>
glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I<lb/>
bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONRADE</speaker>
<p>To the death, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the<lb/>
greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of<lb/>
my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>We'll wait upon your lordship.<lb/>

<p><stage>A hall in LEONATO'S house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and others</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Was not Count John here at supper?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>I saw him not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see<lb/>
him but I am heart-burned an hour after.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>He is of a very melancholy disposition.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>He were an excellent man that were made just in the<lb/>
midway between him and Benedick: the one is too<lb/>
like an image and says nothing, and the other too<lb/>
like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's<lb/>
mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior<lb/>
Benedick's face,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money<lb/>
enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman<lb/>
in the world, if a' could get her good-will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a<lb/>
husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>In faith, she's too curst.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's<lb/>
sending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curst<lb/>
cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Just, if he send me no husband; for the which<lb/>
blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and<lb/>
evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a<lb/>
beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>You may light on a husband that hath no beard.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel<lb/>
and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a<lb/>
beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no<lb/>
beard is less than a man: and he that is more than<lb/>
a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a<lb/>
man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take<lb/>
sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his<lb/>
apes into hell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Well, then, go you into hell?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet<lb/>
me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and<lb/>
say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to<lb/>
heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver<lb/>
I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the<lb/>
heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and<lb/>
there live we as merry as the day is long.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p><stage>[To HERO]</stage>  Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled<lb/>
by your father.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy<lb/>
and say 'Father, as it please you.' But yet for all<lb/>
that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else<lb/>
make another curtsy and say 'Father, as it please<lb/>
me.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Not till God make men of some other metal than<lb/>
earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be<lb/>
overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make<lb/>
an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?<lb/>
No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;<lb/>
and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince<lb/>
do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be<lb/>
not wooed in good time: if the prince be too<lb/>
important, tell him there is measure in every thing<lb/>
and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero:<lb/>
wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,<lb/>
a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot<lb/>
and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as<lb/>
fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a<lb/>
measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes<lb/>
repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the<lb/>
cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>The revellers are entering, brother: make good room.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>All put on their masks</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, BALTHASAR,	DON JOHN, BORACHIO, MARGARET, URSULA and others, masked</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Lady, will you walk about with your friend?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,<lb/>
I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>With me in your company?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>I may say so, when I please.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>And when please you to say so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>When I like your favour; for God defend the lute<lb/>
should be like the case!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>Why, then, your visor should be thatched.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Speak low, if you speak love.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Drawing her aside</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BALTHASAR</speaker>
<p>Well, I would you did like me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>So would not I, for your own sake; for I have many<lb/>
ill-qualities.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BALTHASAR</speaker>
<p>Which is one?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>I say my prayers aloud.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BALTHASAR</speaker>
<p>I love you the better: the hearers may cry, Amen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>God match me with a good dancer!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BALTHASAR</speaker>
<p>Amen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is<lb/>
done! Answer, clerk.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BALTHASAR</speaker>
<p>No more words: the clerk is answered.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>URSULA</speaker>
<p>I know you well enough; you are Signior Antonio.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>At a word, I am not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>URSULA</speaker>
<p>I know you by the waggling of your head.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>To tell you true, I counterfeit him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>URSULA</speaker>
<p>You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were<lb/>
the very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: you<lb/>
are he, you are he.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>At a word, I am not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>URSULA</speaker>
<p>Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your<lb/>
excellent wit? can virtue hide itself? Go to,<lb/>
mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there's an<lb/>
end.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Will you not tell me who told you so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>No, you shall pardon me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Nor will you not tell me who you are?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Not now.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit<lb/>
out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'&mdash;well this was<lb/>
Signior Benedick that said so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>What's he?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>I am sure you know him well enough.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Not I, believe me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Did he never make you laugh?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>I pray you, what is he?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;<lb/>
only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:<lb/>
none but libertines delight in him; and the<lb/>
commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany;<lb/>
for he both pleases men and angers them, and then<lb/>
they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in<lb/>
the fleet: I would he had boarded me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;<lb/>
which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,<lb/>
strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a<lb/>
partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no<lb/>
supper that night.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Music</stage></p>


<p>
We must follow the leaders.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>In every good thing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at<lb/>
the next turning.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Dance. Then exeunt all except DON JOHN, BORACHIO,	and CLAUDIO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath<lb/>
withdrawn her father to break with him about it.<lb/>
The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>Are not you Signior Benedick?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>You know me well; I am he.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>Signior, you are very near my brother in his love:<lb/>
he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him<lb/>
from her: she is no equal for his birth: you may<lb/>
do the part of an honest man in it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>How know you he loves her?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>I heard him swear his affection.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>Come, let us to the banquet.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt DON JOHN and BORACHIO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,<lb/>
But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.<lb/>
'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.<lb/>
Friendship is constant in all other things<lb/>
Save in the office and affairs of love:<lb/>
Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;<lb/>
Let every eye negotiate for itself<lb/>
And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch<lb/>
Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.<lb/>
This is an accident of hourly proof,<lb/>
Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter BENEDICK</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Count Claudio?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Yea, the same.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Come, will you go with me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Whither?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Even to the next willow, about your own business,<lb/>
county. What fashion will you wear the garland of?<lb/>
about your neck, like an usurer's chain? or under<lb/>
your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear<lb/>
it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>I wish him joy of her.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so they<lb/>
sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would<lb/>
have served you thus?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>I pray you, leave me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Ho! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas the<lb/>
boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>If it will not be, I'll leave you.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.<lb/>
But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not<lb/>
know me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I go<lb/>
under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I<lb/>
am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it<lb/>
is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice<lb/>
that puts the world into her person and so gives me<lb/>
out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter DON PEDRO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Now, signior, where's the count? did you see him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.<lb/>
I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a<lb/>
warren: I told him, and I think I told him true,<lb/>
that your grace had got the good will of this young<lb/>
lady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,<lb/>
either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or<lb/>
to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>To be whipped! What's his fault?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who, being<lb/>
overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his<lb/>
companion, and he steals it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The<lb/>
transgression is in the stealer.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,<lb/>
and the garland too; for the garland he might have<lb/>
worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on<lb/>
you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>If their singing answer your saying, by my faith,<lb/>
you say honestly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the<lb/>
gentleman that danced with her told her she is much<lb/>
wronged by you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!<lb/>
an oak but with one green leaf on it would have<lb/>
answered her; my very visor began to assume life and<lb/>
scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been<lb/>
myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was<lb/>
duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest<lb/>
with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood<lb/>
like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at<lb/>
me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:<lb/>
if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,<lb/>
there were no living near her; she would infect to<lb/>
the north star. I would not marry her, though she<lb/>
were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before<lb/>
he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have<lb/>
turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make<lb/>
the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find<lb/>
her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God<lb/>
some scholar would conjure her; for certainly, while<lb/>
she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a<lb/>
sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because they<lb/>
would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror<lb/>
and perturbation follows her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Look, here she comes.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter CLAUDIO, BEATRICE, HERO, and LEONATO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Will your grace command me any service to the<lb/>
world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now<lb/>
to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;<lb/>
I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the<lb/>
furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of<lb/>
Prester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the great<lb/>
Cham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies,<lb/>
rather than hold three words' conference with this<lb/>
harpy. You have no employment for me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>None, but to desire your good company.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>O God, sir, here's a dish I love not: I cannot<lb/>
endure my Lady Tongue.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of<lb/>
Signior Benedick.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave<lb/>
him use for it, a double heart for his single one:<lb/>
marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,<lb/>
therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I<lb/>
should prove the mother of fools. I have brought<lb/>
Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Why, how now, count! wherefore are you sad?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Not sad, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>How then? sick?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Neither, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor<lb/>
well; but civil count, civil as an orange, and<lb/>
something of that jealous complexion.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true;<lb/>
though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is<lb/>
false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and<lb/>
fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,<lb/>
and his good will obtained: name the day of<lb/>
marriage, and God give thee joy!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my<lb/>
fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an<lb/>
grace say Amen to it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Speak, count, 'tis your cue.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were<lb/>
but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as<lb/>
you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for<lb/>
you and dote upon the exchange.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth<lb/>
with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on<lb/>
the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his<lb/>
ear that he is in her heart.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>And so she doth, cousin.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the<lb/>
world but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a<lb/>
corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>I would rather have one of your father's getting.<lb/>
Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your<lb/>
father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Will you have me, lady?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>No, my lord, unless I might have another for<lb/>
working-days: your grace is too costly to wear<lb/>
every day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: I<lb/>
was born to speak all mirth and no matter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best<lb/>
becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in<lb/>
a merry hour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there<lb/>
was a star danced, and under that was I born.<lb/>
Cousins, God give you joy!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>I cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace's pardon.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>There's little of the melancholy element in her, my<lb/>
lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps, and<lb/>
not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,<lb/>
she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked<lb/>
herself with laughing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>O, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>She were an excellent wife for Benedict.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married,<lb/>
they would talk themselves mad.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>To-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches till love<lb/>
have all his rites.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just<lb/>
seven-night; and a time too brief, too, to have all<lb/>
things answer my mind.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing:<lb/>
but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go<lb/>
dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of<lb/>
Hercules' labours; which is, to bring Signior<lb/>
Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of<lb/>
affection the one with the other. I would fain have<lb/>
it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if<lb/>
you three will but minister such assistance as I<lb/>
shall give you direction.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten<lb/>
nights' watchings.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>And I, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>And you too, gentle Hero?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my<lb/>
cousin to a good husband.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that<lb/>
I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble<lb/>
strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I<lb/>
will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she<lb/>
shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your<lb/>
two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in<lb/>
despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he<lb/>
shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,<lb/>
Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory shall be<lb/>
ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,<lb/>
and I will tell you my drift.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter DON JOHN and BORACHIO</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the<lb/>
daughter of Leonato.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be<lb/>
medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him,<lb/>
and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges<lb/>
evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no<lb/>
dishonesty shall appear in me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>Show me briefly how.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>I think I told your lordship a year since, how much<lb/>
I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting<lb/>
gentlewoman to Hero.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>I remember.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,<lb/>
appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to<lb/>
the prince your brother; spare not to tell him that<lb/>
he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned<lb/>
Claudio&mdash;whose estimation do you mightily hold<lb/>
up&mdash;to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>What proof shall I make of that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio,<lb/>
to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for any<lb/>
other issue?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and<lb/>
the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know<lb/>
that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the<lb/>
prince and Claudio, as,&mdash;in love of your brother's<lb/>
honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's<lb/>
reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the<lb/>
semblance of a maid,&mdash;that you have discovered<lb/>
thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:<lb/>
offer them instances; which shall bear no less<lb/>
likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,<lb/>
hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me<lb/>
Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night<lb/>
before the intended wedding,&mdash;for in the meantime I<lb/>
will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be<lb/>
absent,&mdash;and there shall appear such seeming truth<lb/>
of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called<lb/>
assurance and all the preparation overthrown.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put<lb/>
it in practise. Be cunning in the working this, and<lb/>
thy fee is a thousand ducats.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning<lb/>
shall not shame me.<lb/>

<p>Boy!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boy</speaker>
<p>Signior?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>In my chamber-window lies a book: bring it hither<lb/>
to me in the orchard.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boy</speaker>
<p>I am here already, sir.<lb/>

<p>I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit Boy</stage></p>


<p>
I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much<lb/>
another man is a fool when he dedicates his<lb/>
behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at<lb/>
such shallow follies in others, become the argument<lb/>
of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man<lb/>
is Claudio. I have known when there was no music<lb/>
with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he<lb/>
rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known<lb/>
when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a<lb/>
good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,<lb/>
carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to<lb/>
speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man<lb/>
and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his<lb/>
words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many<lb/>
strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with<lb/>
these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not<lb/>
be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but<lb/>
I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster<lb/>
of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman<lb/>
is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am<lb/>
well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all<lb/>
graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in<lb/>
my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,<lb/>
or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;<lb/>
fair, or I'll   never look on her; mild, or come not<lb/>
near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good<lb/>
discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall<lb/>
be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and<lb/>
Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.<lb/>

<p>
Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of<lb/>
to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with<lb/>
Signior Benedick?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>O, ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I did<lb/>
never think that lady would have loved any man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she<lb/>
should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in<lb/>
all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think<lb/>
of it but that she loves him with an enraged<lb/>
affection: it is past the infinite of thought.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>May be she doth but counterfeit.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Faith, like enough.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of<lb/>
passion came so near the life of passion as she<lb/>
discovers it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Why, what effects of passion shows she?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard<lb/>
my daughter tell you how.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>She did, indeed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I<lb/>
thought her spirit had been invincible against all<lb/>
assaults of affection.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially<lb/>
against Benedick.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>I should think this a gull, but that the<lb/>
white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,<lb/>
sure, hide himself in such reverence.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall<lb/>
I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him<lb/>
with scorn, write to him that I love him?'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>This says she now when she is beginning to write to<lb/>
him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and<lb/>
there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a<lb/>
sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a<lb/>
pretty jest your daughter told us of.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she<lb/>
found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>That.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;<lb/>
railed at herself, that she should be so immodest<lb/>
to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I<lb/>
measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I<lb/>
should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I<lb/>
love him, I should.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,<lb/>
beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O<lb/>
sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the<lb/>
ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter<lb/>
is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage<lb/>
to herself: it is very true.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>It were good that Benedick knew of it by some<lb/>
other, if she will not discover it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>To what end? He would make but a sport of it and<lb/>
torment the poor lady worse.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an<lb/>
excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,<lb/>
she is virtuous.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>And she is exceeding wise.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>In every thing but in loving Benedick.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender<lb/>
a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath<lb/>
the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just<lb/>
cause, being her uncle and her guardian.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would<lb/>
have daffed all other respects and made her half<lb/>
myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear<lb/>
what a' will say.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Were it good, think you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she<lb/>
will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere<lb/>
she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo<lb/>
her, rather than she will bate one breath of her<lb/>
accustomed crossness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>She doth well: if she should make tender of her<lb/>
love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the<lb/>
man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>He is a very proper man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>He hath indeed a good outward happiness.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>And I take him to be valiant.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of<lb/>
quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he<lb/>
avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes<lb/>
them with a most Christian-like fear.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:<lb/>
if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a<lb/>
quarrel with fear and trembling.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,<lb/>
howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests<lb/>
he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall<lb/>
we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with<lb/>
good counsel.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:<lb/>
let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I<lb/>
could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see<lb/>
how much he is unworthy so good a lady.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never<lb/>
trust my expectation.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Let there be the same net spread for her; and that<lb/>
must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The<lb/>
sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of<lb/>
another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the<lb/>
scene that I would see, which will be merely a<lb/>
dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p><stage>[Coming forward]</stage>  This can be no trick: the<lb/>
conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of<lb/>
this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it<lb/>
seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!<lb/>
why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:<lb/>
they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive<lb/>
the love come from her; they say too that she will<lb/>
rather die than give any sign of affection. I did<lb/>
never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy<lb/>
are they that hear their detractions and can put<lb/>
them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a<lb/>
truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis<lb/>
so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving<lb/>
me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor<lb/>
no great argument of her folly, for I will be<lb/>
horribly in love with her. I may chance have some<lb/>
odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,<lb/>
because I have railed so long against marriage: but<lb/>
doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat<lb/>
in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.<lb/>
Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of<lb/>
the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?<lb/>
No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would<lb/>
die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I<lb/>
were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!<lb/>
she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in<lb/>
her.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter BEATRICE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>I took no more pains for those thanks than you take<lb/>
pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would<lb/>
not have come.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>You take pleasure then in the message?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's<lb/>
point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach,<lb/>
signior: fare you well.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in<lb/>
to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took<lb/>
no more pains for those thanks than you took pains<lb/>
to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains<lb/>
that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do<lb/>
not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not<lb/>
love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.<lb/>

<p><stage>LEONATO'S garden.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;<lb/>
There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice<lb/>
Proposing with the prince and Claudio:<lb/>
Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula<lb/>
Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse<lb/>
Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;<lb/>
And bid her steal into the pleached bower,<lb/>
Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,<lb/>
Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,<lb/>
Made proud by princes, that advance their pride<lb/>
Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,<lb/>
To listen our purpose.  This is thy office;<lb/>
Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,<lb/>
As we do trace this alley up and down,<lb/>
Our talk must only be of Benedick.<lb/>
When I do name him, let it be thy part<lb/>
To praise him more than ever man did merit:<lb/>
My talk to thee must be how Benedick<lb/>
Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter<lb/>
Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,<lb/>
That only wounds by hearsay.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter BEATRICE, behind</stage></p>


<p>
Now begin;<lb/>
For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs<lb/>
Close by the ground, to hear our conference.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>URSULA</speaker>
<p>The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish<lb/>
Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,<lb/>
And greedily devour the treacherous bait:<lb/>
So angle we for Beatrice; who even now<lb/>
Is couched in the woodbine coverture.<lb/>
Fear you not my part of the dialogue.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing<lb/>
Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Approaching the bower</stage></p>


<p>
No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;<lb/>
I know her spirits are as coy and wild<lb/>
As haggerds of the rock.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>URSULA</speaker>
<p>But are you sure<lb/>
That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>URSULA</speaker>
<p>And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;<lb/>
But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,<lb/>
To wish him wrestle with affection,<lb/>
And never to let Beatrice know of it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>URSULA</speaker>
<p>Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman<lb/>
Deserve as full as fortunate a bed<lb/>
As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>O god of love! I know he doth deserve<lb/>
As much as may be yielded to a man:<lb/>
But Nature never framed a woman's heart<lb/>
Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;<lb/>
Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,<lb/>
Misprising what they look on, and her wit<lb/>
Values itself so highly that to her<lb/>
All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,<lb/>
Nor take no shape nor project of affection,<lb/>
She is so self-endeared.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>URSULA</speaker>
<p>Sure, I think so;<lb/>
And therefore certainly it were not good<lb/>
She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,<lb/>
How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,<lb/>
But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,<lb/>
She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;<lb/>
If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,<lb/>
Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;<lb/>
If low, an agate very vilely cut;<lb/>
If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;<lb/>
If silent, why, a block moved with none.<lb/>
So turns she every man the wrong side out<lb/>
And never gives to truth and virtue that<lb/>
Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>URSULA</speaker>
<p>Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>No, not to be so odd and from all fashions<lb/>
As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:<lb/>
But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,<lb/>
She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me<lb/>
Out of myself, press me to death with wit.<lb/>
Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,<lb/>
Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:<lb/>
It were a better death than die with mocks,<lb/>
Which is as bad as die with tickling.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>URSULA</speaker>
<p>Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>No; rather I will go to Benedick<lb/>
And counsel him to fight against his passion.<lb/>
And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders<lb/>
To stain my cousin with: one doth not know<lb/>
How much an ill word may empoison liking.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>URSULA</speaker>
<p>O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.<lb/>
She cannot be so much without true judgment&mdash;<lb/>
Having so swift and excellent a wit<lb/>
As she is prized to have&mdash;as to refuse<lb/>
So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>He is the only man of Italy.<lb/>
Always excepted my dear Claudio.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>URSULA</speaker>
<p>I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,<lb/>
Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,<lb/>
For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,<lb/>
Goes foremost in report through Italy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>URSULA</speaker>
<p>His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.<lb/>
When are you married, madam?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:<lb/>
I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel<lb/>
Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>URSULA</speaker>
<p>She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:<lb/>
Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt HERO and URSULA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p><stage>[Coming forward]</stage><lb/>
What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?<lb/>
Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?<lb/>
Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!<lb/>
No glory lives behind the back of such.<lb/>
And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,<lb/>
Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:<lb/>
If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee<lb/>
To bind our loves up in a holy band;<lb/>
For others say thou dost deserve, and I<lb/>
Believe it better than reportingly.<lb/>

<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>A room in LEONATO'S house</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and LEONATO</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and<lb/>
then go I toward Arragon.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll<lb/>
vouchsafe me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss<lb/>
of your marriage as to show a child his new coat<lb/>
and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold<lb/>
with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown<lb/>
of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all<lb/>
mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's<lb/>
bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at<lb/>
him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his<lb/>
tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks his<lb/>
tongue speaks.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Gallants, I am not as I have been.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>	So say I<lb/>
methinks you are sadder.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>I hope he be in love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood in<lb/>
him, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,<lb/>
he wants money.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>I have the toothache.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Draw it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Hang it!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>What! sigh for the toothache?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Where is but a humour or a worm.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Well, every one can master a grief but he that has<lb/>
it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Yet say I, he is in love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be<lb/>
a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be<lb/>
a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the<lb/>
shape of two countries at once, as, a German from<lb/>
the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from<lb/>
the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy<lb/>
to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no<lb/>
fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>If he be not in love with some woman, there is no<lb/>
believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o'<lb/>
mornings; what should that bode?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Hath any man seen him at the barber's?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,<lb/>
and the old ornament of his cheek hath already<lb/>
stuffed tennis-balls.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him<lb/>
out by that?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>The greatest note of it is his melancholy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>And when was he wont to wash his face?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear<lb/>
what they say of him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into<lb/>
a lute-string and now governed by stops.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,<lb/>
conclude he is in love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Nay, but I know who loves him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of<lb/>
all, dies for him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>She shall be buried with her face upwards.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old<lb/>
signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight<lb/>
or nine wise words to speak to you, which these<lb/>
hobby-horses must not hear.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt BENEDICK and LEONATO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this<lb/>
played their parts with Beatrice; and then the two<lb/>
bears will not bite one another when they meet.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter DON JOHN</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>My lord and brother, God save you!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Good den, brother.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>If your leisure served, I would speak with you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>In private?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>If it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear; for<lb/>
what I would speak of concerns him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>What's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p><stage>[To CLAUDIO]</stage>  Means your lordship to be married<lb/>
to-morrow?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>You know he does.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>I know not that, when he knows what I know.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>You may think I love you not: let that appear<lb/>
hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will<lb/>
manifest. For my brother, I think he holds you<lb/>
well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect<lb/>
your ensuing marriage;&mdash;surely suit ill spent and<lb/>
labour ill bestowed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Why, what's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances<lb/>
shortened, for she has been too long a talking of,<lb/>
the lady is disloyal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Who, Hero?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Even she; Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero:<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Disloyal?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>The word is too good to paint out her wickedness; I<lb/>
could say she were worse: think you of a worse<lb/>
title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till<lb/>
further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall<lb/>
see her chamber-window entered, even the night<lb/>
before her wedding-day: if you love her then,<lb/>
to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour<lb/>
to change your mind.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>May this be so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>I will not think it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>If you dare not trust that you see, confess not<lb/>
that you know: if you will follow me, I will show<lb/>
you enough; and when you have seen more and heard<lb/>
more, proceed accordingly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry<lb/>
her to-morrow in the congregation, where I should<lb/>
wed, there will I shame her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join<lb/>
with thee to disgrace her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>I will disparage her no farther till you are my<lb/>
witnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight, and<lb/>
let the issue show itself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>O day untowardly turned!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>O mischief strangely thwarting!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>O plague right well prevented! so will you say when<lb/>
you have seen the sequel.<lb/>

<p><stage>A street.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Are you good men and true?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERGES</speaker>
<p>Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer<lb/>
salvation, body and soul.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if<lb/>
they should have any allegiance in them, being<lb/>
chosen for the prince's watch.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERGES</speaker>
<p>Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>First, who think you the most desertless man to be<lb/>
constable?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Watchman</speaker>
<p>Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they can<lb/>
write and read.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed<lb/>
you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is<lb/>
the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Watchman</speaker>
<p>Both which, master constable,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,<lb/>
for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make<lb/>
no boast of it; and for your writing and reading,<lb/>
let that appear when there is no need of such<lb/>
vanity. You are thought here to be the most<lb/>
senseless and fit man for the constable of the<lb/>
watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your<lb/>
charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are<lb/>
to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Watchman</speaker>
<p>How if a' will not stand?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and<lb/>
presently call the rest of the watch together and<lb/>
thank God you are rid of a knave.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERGES</speaker>
<p>If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none<lb/>
of the prince's subjects.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>True, and they are to meddle with none but the<lb/>
prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in<lb/>
the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to<lb/>
talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Watchman</speaker>
<p>We will rather sleep than talk: we know what<lb/>
belongs to a watch.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet<lb/>
watchman; for I cannot see how sleeping should<lb/>
offend: only, have a care that your bills be not<lb/>
stolen. Well, you are to call at all the<lb/>
ale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Watchman</speaker>
<p>How if they will not?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: if<lb/>
they make you not then the better answer, you may<lb/>
say they are not the men you took them for.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Watchman</speaker>
<p>Well, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue<lb/>
of your office, to be no true man; and, for such<lb/>
kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,<lb/>
why the more is for your honesty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Watchman</speaker>
<p>If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay<lb/>
hands on him?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they<lb/>
that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable<lb/>
way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him<lb/>
show himself what he is and steal out of your company.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERGES</speaker>
<p>You have been always called a merciful man, partner.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more<lb/>
a man who hath any honesty in him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERGES</speaker>
<p>If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call<lb/>
to the nurse and bid her still it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Watchman</speaker>
<p>How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake<lb/>
her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her<lb/>
lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERGES</speaker>
<p>'Tis very true.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>This is the end of the charge:&mdash;you, constable, are<lb/>
to present the prince's own person: if you meet the<lb/>
prince in the night, you may stay him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERGES</speaker>
<p>Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knows<lb/>
the statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without<lb/>
the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought<lb/>
to offend no man; and it is an offence to stay a<lb/>
man against his will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERGES</speaker>
<p>By'r lady, I think it be so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Ha, ha, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be<lb/>
any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your<lb/>
fellows' counsels and your own; and good night.<lb/>
Come, neighbour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Watchman</speaker>
<p>Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here<lb/>
upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watch<lb/>
about Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding being<lb/>
there to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night.<lb/>
Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>What Conrade!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Watchman</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage>  Peace! stir not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Conrade, I say!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONRADE</speaker>
<p>Here, man; I am at thy elbow.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Mass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would a<lb/>
scab follow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONRADE</speaker>
<p>I will owe thee an answer for that: and now forward<lb/>
with thy tale.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house, for<lb/>
it drizzles rain; and I will, like a true drunkard,<lb/>
utter all to thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Watchman</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage>  Some treason, masters: yet stand close.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONRADE</speaker>
<p>Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any<lb/>
villany should be so rich; for when rich villains<lb/>
have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what<lb/>
price they will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONRADE</speaker>
<p>I wonder at it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that<lb/>
the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is<lb/>
nothing to a man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONRADE</speaker>
<p>Yes, it is apparel.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>I mean, the fashion.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONRADE</speaker>
<p>Yes, the fashion is the fashion.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But<lb/>
seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion<lb/>
is?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Watchman</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside]</stage>  I know that Deformed; a' has been a vile<lb/>
thief this seven year; a' goes up and down like a<lb/>
gentleman: I remember his name.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Didst thou not hear somebody?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONRADE</speaker>
<p>No; 'twas the vane on the house.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this<lb/>
fashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hot<lb/>
bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?<lb/>
sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers<lb/>
in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel's<lb/>
priests in the old church-window, sometime like the<lb/>
shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,<lb/>
where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONRADE</speaker>
<p>All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears<lb/>
out more apparel than the man. But art not thou<lb/>
thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast<lb/>
shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night<lb/>
wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the<lb/>
name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'<lb/>
chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good<lb/>
night,&mdash;I tell this tale vilely:&mdash;I should first<lb/>
tell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,<lb/>
planted and placed and possessed by my master Don<lb/>
John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONRADE</speaker>
<p>And thought they Margaret was Hero?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but the<lb/>
devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly<lb/>
by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by<lb/>
the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly<lb/>
by my villany, which did confirm any slander that<lb/>
Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore<lb/>
he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning<lb/>
at the temple, and there, before the whole<lb/>
congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night<lb/>
and send her home again without a husband.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Watchman</speaker>
<p>We charge you, in the prince's name, stand!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Watchman</speaker>
<p>Call up the right master constable. We have here<lb/>
recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that<lb/>
ever was known in the commonwealth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Watchman</speaker>
<p>And one Deformed is one of them: I know him; a'<lb/>
wears a lock.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONRADE</speaker>
<p>Masters, masters,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Second Watchman</speaker>
<p>You'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONRADE</speaker>
<p>Masters,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>First Watchman</speaker>
<p>Never speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken<lb/>
up of these men's bills.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONRADE</speaker>
<p>A commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we'll obey you.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice, and desire<lb/>
her to rise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>URSULA</speaker>
<p>I will, lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Troth, I think your other rabato were better.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>No, pray thee, good Meg, I'll wear this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>By my troth, 's not so good; and I warrant your<lb/>
cousin will say so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>My cousin's a fool, and thou art another: I'll wear<lb/>
none but this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair<lb/>
were a thought browner; and your gown's a most rare<lb/>
fashion, i' faith. I saw the Duchess of Milan's<lb/>
gown that they praise so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>O, that exceeds, they say.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>By my troth, 's but a night-gown in respect of<lb/>
yours: cloth o' gold, and cuts, and laced with<lb/>
silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves,<lb/>
and skirts, round underborne with a bluish tinsel:<lb/>
but for a fine, quaint, graceful and excellent<lb/>
fashion, yours is worth ten on 't.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>God give me joy to wear it! for my heart is<lb/>
exceeding heavy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>Fie upon thee! art not ashamed?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is not<lb/>
marriage honourable in a beggar? Is not your lord<lb/>
honourable without marriage? I think you would have<lb/>
me say, 'saving your reverence, a husband:' and bad<lb/>
thinking do not wrest true speaking, I'll offend<lb/>
nobody: is there any harm in 'the heavier for a<lb/>
husband'? None, I think, and it be the right husband<lb/>
and the right wife; otherwise 'tis light, and not<lb/>
heavy: ask my Lady Beatrice else; here she comes.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter BEATRICE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, coz.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, sweet Hero.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>Why how now? do you speak in the sick tune?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>I am out of all other tune, methinks.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Clap's into 'Light o' love;' that goes without a<lb/>
burden: do you sing it, and I'll dance it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Ye light o' love, with your heels! then, if your<lb/>
husband have stables enough, you'll see he shall<lb/>
lack no barns.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>O illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin; tis time you were<lb/>
ready. By my troth, I am exceeding ill: heigh-ho!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>For the letter that begins them all, H.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Well, and you be not turned Turk, there's no more<lb/>
sailing by the star.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>What means the fool, trow?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Nothing I; but God send every one their heart's desire!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>These gloves the count sent me; they are an<lb/>
excellent perfume.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>I am stuffed, cousin; I cannot smell.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>O, God help me! God help me! how long have you<lb/>
professed apprehension?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Even since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>It is not seen enough, you should wear it in your<lb/>
cap. By my troth, I am sick.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus,<lb/>
and lay it to your heart: it is the only thing for a qualm.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>There thou prickest her with a thistle.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Benedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral in<lb/>
this Benedictus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Moral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I<lb/>
meant, plain holy-thistle. You may think perchance<lb/>
that I think you are in love: nay, by'r lady, I am<lb/>
not such a fool to think what I list, nor I list<lb/>
not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think,<lb/>
if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you<lb/>
are in love or that you will be in love or that you<lb/>
can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and<lb/>
now is he become a man: he swore he would never<lb/>
marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats<lb/>
his meat without grudging: and how you may be<lb/>
converted I know not, but methinks you look with<lb/>
your eyes as other women do.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>What would you with me, honest neighbour?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you<lb/>
that decerns you nearly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Brief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Marry, this it is, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERGES</speaker>
<p>Yes, in truth it is, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>What is it, my good friends?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the<lb/>
matter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not so<lb/>
blunt as, God help, I would desire they were; but,<lb/>
in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERGES</speaker>
<p>Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living<lb/>
that is an old man and no honester than I.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Neighbours, you are tedious.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the<lb/>
poor duke's officers; but truly, for mine own part,<lb/>
if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it in<lb/>
my heart to bestow it all of your worship.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>All thy tediousness on me, ah?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Yea, an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis; for<lb/>
I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any<lb/>
man in the city; and though I be but a poor man, I<lb/>
am glad to hear it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERGES</speaker>
<p>And so am I.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>I would fain know what you have to say.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERGES</speaker>
<p>Marry, sir, our watch to-night, excepting your<lb/>
worship's presence, ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant<lb/>
knaves as any in Messina.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>A good old man, sir; he will be talking: as they<lb/>
say, when the age is in, the wit is out: God help<lb/>
us! it is a world to see. Well said, i' faith,<lb/>
neighbour Verges: well, God's a good man; an two men<lb/>
ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest<lb/>
soul, i' faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever<lb/>
broke bread; but God is to be worshipped; all men<lb/>
are not alike; alas, good neighbour!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>

</p><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Come, Friar Francis, be brief; only to the plain<lb/>
form of marriage, and you shall recount their<lb/>
particular duties afterwards.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR FRANCIS</speaker>
<p>You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>No.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>To be married to her: friar, you come to marry her.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR FRANCIS</speaker>
<p>Lady, you come hither to be married to this count.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>I do.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR FRANCIS</speaker>
<p>If either of you know any inward impediment why you<lb/>
should not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls,<lb/>
to utter it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Know you any, Hero?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>None, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR FRANCIS</speaker>
<p>Know you any, count?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>I dare make his answer, none.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily<lb/>
do, not knowing what they do!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>How now! interjections? Why, then, some be of<lb/>
laughing, as, ah, ha, he!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:<lb/>
Will you with free and unconstrained soul<lb/>
Give me this maid, your daughter?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>As freely, son, as God did give her me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>And what have I to give you back, whose worth<lb/>
May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Nothing, unless you render her again.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.<lb/>
There, Leonato, take her back again:<lb/>
Give not this rotten orange to your friend;<lb/>
She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.<lb/>
Behold how like a maid she blushes here!<lb/>
O, what authority and show of truth<lb/>
Can cunning sin cover itself withal!<lb/>
Comes not that blood as modest evidence<lb/>
To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,<lb/>
All you that see her, that she were a maid,<lb/>
By these exterior shows? But she is none:<lb/>
She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;<lb/>
Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>What do you mean, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Not to be married,<lb/>
Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,<lb/>
Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,<lb/>
And made defeat of her virginity,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>I know what you would say: if I have known her,<lb/>
You will say she did embrace me as a husband,<lb/>
And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:<lb/>
No, Leonato,<lb/>
I never tempted her with word too large;<lb/>
But, as a brother to his sister, show'd<lb/>
Bashful sincerity and comely love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:<lb/>
You seem to me as Dian in her orb,<lb/>
As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;<lb/>
But you are more intemperate in your blood<lb/>
Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals<lb/>
That rage in savage sensuality.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Sweet prince, why speak not you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>What should I speak?<lb/>
I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about<lb/>
To link my dear friend to a common stale.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>This looks not like a nuptial.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>True! O God!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Leonato, stand I here?<lb/>
Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?<lb/>
Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>All this is so: but what of this, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Let me but move one question to your daughter;<lb/>
And, by that fatherly and kindly power<lb/>
That you have in her, bid her answer truly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>O, God defend me! how am I beset!<lb/>
What kind of catechising call you this?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>To make you answer truly to your name.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name<lb/>
With any just reproach?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Marry, that can Hero;<lb/>
Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.<lb/>
What man was he talk'd with you yesternight<lb/>
Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?<lb/>
Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,<lb/>
I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,<lb/>
Myself, my brother and this grieved count<lb/>
Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night<lb/>
Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window<lb/>
Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,<lb/>
Confess'd the vile encounters they have had<lb/>
A thousand times in secret.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,<lb/>
Not to be spoke of;<lb/>
There is not chastity enough in language<lb/>
Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,<lb/>
I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,<lb/>
If half thy outward graces had been placed<lb/>
About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!<lb/>
But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,<lb/>
Thou pure impiety and impious purity!<lb/>
For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,<lb/>
And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,<lb/>
To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,<lb/>
And never shall it more be gracious.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>HERO swoons</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON JOHN</speaker>
<p>Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light,<lb/>
Smother her spirits up.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, and CLAUDIO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>How doth the lady?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Dead, I think. Help, uncle!<lb/>
Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.<lb/>
Death is the fairest cover for her shame<lb/>
That may be wish'd for.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>How now, cousin Hero!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR FRANCIS</speaker>
<p>Have comfort, lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Dost thou look up?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR FRANCIS</speaker>
<p>Yea, wherefore should she not?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing<lb/>
Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny<lb/>
The story that is printed in her blood?<lb/>
Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:<lb/>
For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,<lb/>
Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,<lb/>
Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,<lb/>
Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?<lb/>
Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?<lb/>
O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?<lb/>
Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?<lb/>
Why had I not with charitable hand<lb/>
Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,<lb/>
Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,<lb/>
I might have said 'No part of it is mine;<lb/>
This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?<lb/>
But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised<lb/>
And mine that I was proud on, mine so much<lb/>
That I myself was to myself not mine,<lb/>
Valuing of her,&mdash;why, she, O, she is fallen<lb/>
Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea<lb/>
Hath drops too few to wash her clean again<lb/>
And salt too little which may season give<lb/>
To her foul-tainted flesh!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Sir, sir, be patient.<lb/>
For my part, I am so attired in wonder,<lb/>
I know not what to say.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>No, truly not; although, until last night,<lb/>
I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made<lb/>
Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!<lb/>
Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,<lb/>
Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,<lb/>
Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR FRANCIS</speaker>
<p>Hear me a little; for I have only been<lb/>
Silent so long and given way unto<lb/>
This course of fortune [           ]<lb/>
By noting of the lady I have mark'd<lb/>
A thousand blushing apparitions<lb/>
To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames<lb/>
In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;<lb/>
And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,<lb/>
To burn the errors that these princes hold<lb/>
Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;<lb/>
Trust not my reading nor my observations,<lb/>
Which with experimental seal doth warrant<lb/>
The tenor of my book; trust not my age,<lb/>
My reverence, calling, nor divinity,<lb/>
If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here<lb/>
Under some biting error.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Friar, it cannot be.<lb/>
Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left<lb/>
Is that she will not add to her damnation<lb/>
A sin of perjury; she not denies it:<lb/>
Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse<lb/>
That which appears in proper nakedness?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR FRANCIS</speaker>
<p>Lady, what man is he you are accused of?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>They know that do accuse me; I know none:<lb/>
If I know more of any man alive<lb/>
Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,<lb/>
Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,<lb/>
Prove you that any man with me conversed<lb/>
At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight<lb/>
Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,<lb/>
Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR FRANCIS</speaker>
<p>There is some strange misprision in the princes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Two of them have the very bent of honour;<lb/>
And if their wisdoms be misled in this,<lb/>
The practise of it lives in John the bastard,<lb/>
Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>I know not. If they speak but truth of her,<lb/>
These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,<lb/>
The proudest of them shall well hear of it.<lb/>
Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,<lb/>
Nor age so eat up my invention,<lb/>
Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,<lb/>
Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,<lb/>
But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,<lb/>
Both strength of limb and policy of mind,<lb/>
Ability in means and choice of friends,<lb/>
To quit me of them throughly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR FRANCIS</speaker>
<p>Pause awhile,<lb/>
And let my counsel sway you in this case.<lb/>
Your daughter here the princes left for dead:<lb/>
Let her awhile be secretly kept in,<lb/>
And publish it that she is dead indeed;<lb/>
Maintain a mourning ostentation<lb/>
And on your family's old monument<lb/>
Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites<lb/>
That appertain unto a burial.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>What shall become of this? what will this do?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR FRANCIS</speaker>
<p>Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf<lb/>
Change slander to remorse; that is some good:<lb/>
But not for that dream I on this strange course,<lb/>
But on this travail look for greater birth.<lb/>
She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,<lb/>
Upon the instant that she was accused,<lb/>
Shall be lamented, pitied and excused<lb/>
Of every hearer: for it so falls out<lb/>
That what we have we prize not to the worth<lb/>
Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,<lb/>
Why, then we rack the value, then we find<lb/>
The virtue that possession would not show us<lb/>
Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:<lb/>
When he shall hear she died upon his words,<lb/>
The idea of her life shall sweetly creep<lb/>
Into his study of imagination,<lb/>
And every lovely organ of her life<lb/>
Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,<lb/>
More moving-delicate and full of life,<lb/>
Into the eye and prospect of his soul,<lb/>
Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,<lb/>
If ever love had interest in his liver,<lb/>
And wish he had not so accused her,<lb/>
No, though he thought his accusation true.<lb/>
Let this be so, and doubt not but success<lb/>
Will fashion the event in better shape<lb/>
Than I can lay it down in likelihood.<lb/>
But if all aim but this be levell'd false,<lb/>
The supposition of the lady's death<lb/>
Will quench the wonder of her infamy:<lb/>
And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,<lb/>
As best befits her wounded reputation,<lb/>
In some reclusive and religious life,<lb/>
Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:<lb/>
And though you know my inwardness and love<lb/>
Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,<lb/>
Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this<lb/>
As secretly and justly as your soul<lb/>
Should with your body.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Being that I flow in grief,<lb/>
The smallest twine may lead me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR FRANCIS</speaker>
<p>'Tis well consented: presently away;<lb/>
For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.<lb/>
Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day<lb/>
Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but BENEDICK and BEATRICE</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Yea, and I will weep a while longer.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>I will not desire that.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>You have no reason; I do it freely.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Is there any way to show such friendship?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>A very even way, but no such friend.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>May a man do it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>It is a man's office, but not yours.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is<lb/>
not that strange?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>As strange as the thing I know not. It were as<lb/>
possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as<lb/>
you: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; I<lb/>
confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Do not swear, and eat it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make<lb/>
him eat it that says I love not you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Will you not eat your word?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest<lb/>
I love thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Why, then, God forgive me!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>What offence, sweet Beatrice?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to<lb/>
protest I loved you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>And do it with all thy heart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>I love you with so much of my heart that none is<lb/>
left to protest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Come, bid me do any thing for thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Kill Claudio.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Ha! not for the wide world.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>You kill me to deny it. Farewell.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Tarry, sweet Beatrice.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in<lb/>
you: nay, I pray you, let me go.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Beatrice,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>In faith, I will go.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>We'll be friends first.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Is Claudio thine enemy?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Is he not approved in the height a villain, that<lb/>
hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O<lb/>
that I were a man! What, bear her in hand until they<lb/>
come to take hands; and then, with public<lb/>
accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,<lb/>
&mdash;O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart<lb/>
in the market-place.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Hear me, Beatrice,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Nay, but, Beatrice,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Sweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Beat&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,<lb/>
a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,<lb/>
surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that I<lb/>
had any friend would be a man for my sake! But<lb/>
manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into<lb/>
compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and<lb/>
trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules<lb/>
that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a<lb/>
man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I will<lb/>
kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,<lb/>
Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you<lb/>
hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your<lb/>
cousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>

you serve God?<lb/>

<p>Yea, sir, we hope.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Write down, that they hope they serve God: and<lb/>
write God first; for God defend but God should go<lb/>
before such villains! Masters, it is proved already<lb/>
that you are little better than false knaves; and it<lb/>
will go near to be thought so shortly. How answer<lb/>
you for yourselves?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CONRADE</speaker>
<p>Marry, sir, we say we are none.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>

<p>Master constable, you go not the way to examine:<lb/>
you must call forth the watch that are their accusers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Yea, marry, that's the eftest way. Let the watch<lb/>
come forth. Masters, I charge you, in the prince's<lb/>
name, accuse these men.<lb/>

Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away;<lb/>

down an ass! But, masters, remember that I am an<lb/>
ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not<lb/>
that I am an ass. No, thou villain, thou art full of<lb/>
piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.<lb/>
I am a wise fellow, and, which is more, an officer,<lb/>
and, which is more, a householder, and, which is<lb/>
more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in<lb/>
Messina, and one that knows the law, go to; and a<lb/>

<p>If you go on thus, you will kill yourself:<lb/>
And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief<lb/>
Against yourself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>I pray thee, cease thy counsel,<lb/>
Which falls into mine ears as profitless<lb/>
As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;<lb/>
Nor let no comforter delight mine ear<lb/>
But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.<lb/>
Bring me a father that so loved his child,<lb/>
Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,<lb/>
And bid him speak of patience;<lb/>
Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine<lb/>
And let it answer every strain for strain,<lb/>
As thus for thus and such a grief for such,<lb/>
In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:<lb/>
If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,<lb/>
Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan,<lb/>
Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk<lb/>
With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,<lb/>
And I of him will gather patience.<lb/>
But there is no such man: for, brother, men<lb/>
Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief<lb/>
Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,<lb/>
Their counsel turns to passion, which before<lb/>
Would give preceptial medicine to rage,<lb/>
Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,<lb/>
Charm ache with air and agony with words:<lb/>
No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience<lb/>
To those that wring under the load of sorrow,<lb/>
But no man's virtue nor sufficiency<lb/>
To be so moral when he shall endure<lb/>
The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:<lb/>
My griefs cry louder than advertisement.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Therein do men from children nothing differ.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood;<lb/>
For there was never yet philosopher<lb/>
That could endure the toothache patiently,<lb/>
However they have writ the style of gods<lb/>
And made a push at chance and sufferance.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;<lb/>
Make those that do offend you suffer too.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>There thou speak'st reason: nay, I will do so.<lb/>
My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;<lb/>
And that shall Claudio know; so shall the prince<lb/>
And all of them that thus dishonour her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Good den, good den.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Good day to both of you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Hear you. my lords,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>We have some haste, Leonato.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord:<lb/>
Are you so hasty now? well, all is one.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>If he could right himself with quarreling,<lb/>
Some of us would lie low.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Who wrongs him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou:&mdash;<lb/>
Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;<lb/>
I fear thee not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Marry, beshrew my hand,<lb/>
If it should give your age such cause of fear:<lb/>
In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Tush, tush, man; never fleer and jest at me:<lb/>
I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,<lb/>
As under privilege of age to brag<lb/>
What I have done being young, or what would do<lb/>
Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,<lb/>
Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me<lb/>
That I am forced to lay my reverence by<lb/>
And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,<lb/>
Do challenge thee to trial of a man.<lb/>
I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;<lb/>
Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,<lb/>
And she lies buried with her ancestors;<lb/>
O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,<lb/>
Save this of hers, framed by thy villany!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>My villany?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Thine, Claudio; thine, I say.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>You say not right, old man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>My lord, my lord,<lb/>
I'll prove it on his body, if he dare,<lb/>
Despite his nice fence and his active practise,<lb/>
His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Away! I will not have to do with you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:<lb/>
If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:<lb/>
But that's no matter; let him kill one first;<lb/>
Win me and wear me; let him answer me.<lb/>
Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me:<lb/>
Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;<lb/>
Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Brother,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;<lb/>
And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,<lb/>
That dare as well answer a man indeed<lb/>
As I dare take a serpent by the tongue:<lb/>
Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Brother Antony,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,<lb/>
And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,&mdash;<lb/>
Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,<lb/>
That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,<lb/>
Go anticly, show outward hideousness,<lb/>
And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,<lb/>
How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;<lb/>
And this is all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>But, brother Antony,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Come, 'tis no matter:<lb/>
Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.<lb/>
My heart is sorry for your daughter's death:<lb/>
But, on my honour, she was charged with nothing<lb/>
But what was true and very full of proof.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>My lord, my lord,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>I will not hear you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>No? Come, brother; away! I will be heard.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>And shall, or some of us will smart for it.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt LEONATO and ANTONIO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter BENEDICK</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Now, signior, what news?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Good day, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part<lb/>
almost a fray.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>We had like to have had our two noses snapped off<lb/>
with two old men without teeth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Leonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Had<lb/>
we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came<lb/>
to seek you both.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are<lb/>
high-proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten<lb/>
away. Wilt thou use thy wit?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>It is in my scabbard: shall I draw it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Never any did so, though very many have been beside<lb/>
their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the<lb/>
minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou<lb/>
sick, or angry?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat,<lb/>
thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you<lb/>
charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Nay, then, give him another staff: this last was<lb/>
broke cross.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>By this light, he changes more and more: I think<lb/>
he be angry indeed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Shall I speak a word in your ear?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>God bless me from a challenge!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to CLAUDIO]</stage>  You are a villain; I jest not:<lb/>
I will make it good how you dare, with what you<lb/>
dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will<lb/>
protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet<lb/>
lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me<lb/>
hear from you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>What, a feast, a feast?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>I' faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf's<lb/>
head and a capon; the which if I do not carve most<lb/>
curiously, say my knife's naught. Shall I not find<lb/>
a woodcock too?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the<lb/>
other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,'<lb/>
said she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'a<lb/>
great wit:' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one.'<lb/>
'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit:' 'Just,' said she, 'it<lb/>
hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman<lb/>
is wise:' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman.'<lb/>
'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues:' 'That I<lb/>
believe,' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me on<lb/>
Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning;<lb/>
there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus<lb/>
did she, an hour together, transshape thy particular<lb/>
virtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou<lb/>
wast the properest man in Italy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>For the which she wept heartily and said she cared<lb/>
not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Yea, that she did: but yet, for all that, an if she<lb/>
did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly:<lb/>
the old man's daughter told us all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>All, all; and, moreover, God saw him when he was<lb/>
hid in the garden.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on<lb/>
the sensible Benedick's head?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Yea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick the<lb/>
married man'?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave<lb/>
you now to your gossip-like humour: you break jests<lb/>
as braggarts do their blades, which God be thanked,<lb/>
hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank<lb/>
you: I must discontinue your company: your brother<lb/>
the bastard is fled from Messina: you have among<lb/>
you killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord<lb/>
Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet: and, till<lb/>
then, peace be with him.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>He is in earnest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>In most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, for<lb/>
the love of Beatrice.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>And hath challenged thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Most sincerely.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his<lb/>
doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a<lb/>
doctor to such a man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>But, soft you, let me be: pluck up, my heart, and<lb/>
be sad. Did he not say, my brother was fled?<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter DOGBERRY, VERGES, and the Watch, with CONRADE	and BORACHIO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she<lb/>
shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance: nay,<lb/>
an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>How now? two of my brother's men bound! Borachio<lb/>
one!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Hearken after their offence, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Officers, what offence have these men done?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Marry, sir, they have committed false report;<lb/>
moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily,<lb/>
they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have<lb/>
belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust<lb/>
things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I<lb/>
ask thee what's their offence; sixth and lastly, why<lb/>
they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay<lb/>
to their charge.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Rightly reasoned, and in his own division: and, by<lb/>
my troth, there's one meaning well suited.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus<lb/>
bound to your answer? this learned constable is<lb/>
too cunning to be understood: what's your offence?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine answer:<lb/>
do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have<lb/>
deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms<lb/>
could not discover, these shallow fools have brought<lb/>
to light: who in the night overheard me confessing<lb/>
to this man how Don John your brother incensed me<lb/>
to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into<lb/>
the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's<lb/>
garments, how you disgraced her, when you should<lb/>
marry her: my villany they have upon record; which<lb/>
I had rather seal with my death than repeat over<lb/>
to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my<lb/>
master's false accusation; and, briefly, I desire<lb/>
nothing but the reward of a villain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>But did my brother set thee on to this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>He is composed and framed of treachery:<lb/>
And fled he is upon this villany.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear<lb/>
In the rare semblance that I loved it first.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our<lb/>
sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter:<lb/>
and, masters, do not forget to specify, when time<lb/>
and place shall serve, that I am an ass.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>VERGES</speaker>
<p>Here, here comes master Signior Leonato, and the<lb/>
Sexton too.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, with the Sexton</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Which is the villain? let me see his eyes,<lb/>
That, when I note another man like him,<lb/>
I may avoid him: which of these is he?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>If you would know your wronger, look on me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd<lb/>
Mine innocent child?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>Yea, even I alone.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:<lb/>
Here stand a pair of honourable men;<lb/>
A third is fled, that had a hand in it.<lb/>
I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death:<lb/>
Record it with your high and worthy deeds:<lb/>
'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>I know not how to pray your patience;<lb/>
Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;<lb/>
Impose me to what penance your invention<lb/>
Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn'd I not<lb/>
But in mistaking.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>By my soul, nor I:<lb/>
And yet, to satisfy this good old man,<lb/>
I would bend under any heavy weight<lb/>
That he'll enjoin me to.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>I cannot bid you bid my daughter live;<lb/>
That were impossible: but, I pray you both,<lb/>
Possess the people in Messina here<lb/>
How innocent she died; and if your love<lb/>
Can labour ought in sad invention,<lb/>
Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb<lb/>
And sing it to her bones, sing it to-night:<lb/>
To-morrow morning come you to my house,<lb/>
And since you could not be my son-in-law,<lb/>
Be yet my nephew: my brother hath a daughter,<lb/>
Almost the copy of my child that's dead,<lb/>
And she alone is heir to both of us:<lb/>
Give her the right you should have given her cousin,<lb/>
And so dies my revenge.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>O noble sir,<lb/>
Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!<lb/>
I do embrace your offer; and dispose<lb/>
For henceforth of poor Claudio.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>To-morrow then I will expect your coming;<lb/>
To-night I take my leave. This naughty man<lb/>
Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,<lb/>
Who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong,<lb/>
Hired to it by your brother.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BORACHIO</speaker>
<p>No, by my soul, she was not,<lb/>
Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,<lb/>
But always hath been just and virtuous<lb/>
In any thing that I do know by her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and<lb/>
black, this plaintiff here, the offender, did call<lb/>
me ass: I beseech you, let it be remembered in his<lb/>
punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of<lb/>
one Deformed: they say be wears a key in his ear and<lb/>
a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God's<lb/>
name, the which he hath used so long and never paid<lb/>
that now men grow hard-hearted and will lend nothing<lb/>
for God's sake: pray you, examine him upon that point.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>Your worship speaks like a most thankful and<lb/>
reverend youth; and I praise God for you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>There's for thy pains.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>God save the foundation!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DOGBERRY</speaker>
<p>I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I<lb/>
beseech your worship to correct yourself, for the<lb/>
example of others. God keep your worship! I wish<lb/>
your worship well; God restore you to health! I<lb/>
humbly give you leave to depart; and if a merry<lb/>
meeting may be wished, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour.<lb/>

<p>Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>We will not fail.<lb/>

<p>To-night I'll mourn with Hero.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter BENEDICK and MARGARET, meeting</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at<lb/>
my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living<lb/>
shall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thou<lb/>
deservest it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>To have no man come over me! why, shall I always<lb/>
keep below stairs?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit,<lb/>
but hurt not.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a<lb/>
woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice: I give<lb/>
thee the bucklers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the<lb/>
pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MARGARET</speaker>
<p>Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.<lb/>

<p>
The god of love,<lb/>
That sits above,<lb/>
And knows me, and knows me,<lb/>
How pitiful I deserve,&mdash;<lb/>

I mean in singing; but in loving, Leander the good<lb/>
swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and<lb/>
a whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers,<lb/>
whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a<lb/>
blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned<lb/>
over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I<lb/>
cannot show it in rhyme; I have tried: I can find<lb/>
out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent<lb/>
rhyme; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rhyme; for,<lb/>
'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rhyme; very ominous<lb/>
endings: no, I was not born under a rhyming planet,<lb/>
nor I cannot woo in festival terms.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter BEATRICE</stage></p>


<p>
Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>O, stay but till then!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>'Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere<lb/>
I go, let me go with that I came; which is, with<lb/>
knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but<lb/>
foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I<lb/>
will depart unkissed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense,<lb/>
so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee<lb/>
plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge; and either<lb/>
I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe<lb/>
him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me for<lb/>
which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>For them all together; which maintained so politic<lb/>
a state of evil that they will not admit any good<lb/>
part to intermingle with them. But for which of my<lb/>
good parts did you first suffer love for me?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Suffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer love<lb/>
indeed, for I love thee against my will.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>In spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart!<lb/>
If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for<lb/>
yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>It appears not in this confession: there's not one<lb/>
wise man among twenty that will praise himself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in<lb/>
the lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erect<lb/>
in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live<lb/>
no longer in monument than the bell rings and the<lb/>
widow weeps.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>And how long is that, think you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in<lb/>
rheum: therefore is it most expedient for the<lb/>
wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no<lb/>
impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his<lb/>
own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for<lb/>
praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is<lb/>
praiseworthy: and now tell me, how doth your cousin?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Very ill.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>And how do you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Very ill too.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Serve God, love me and mend. There will I leave<lb/>
you too, for here comes one in haste.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter URSULA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>URSULA</speaker>
<p>Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old<lb/>
coil at home: it is proved my Lady Hero hath been<lb/>
falsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightily<lb/>
abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is<lb/>
fed and gone. Will you come presently?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Will you go hear this news, signior?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be<lb/>
buried in thy eyes; and moreover I will go with<lb/>
thee to thy uncle's.<lb/>


</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>

<p><stage>A church.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and three or four	with tapers</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Is this the monument of Leonato?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lord</speaker>
<p>It is, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p><stage>[Reading out of a scroll]</stage><lb/>
Done to death by slanderous tongues<lb/>
Was the Hero that here lies:<lb/>
Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,<lb/>
Gives her fame which never dies.<lb/>
So the life that died with shame<lb/>
Lives in death with glorious fame.<lb/>
Hang thou there upon the tomb,<lb/>
Praising her when I am dumb.<lb/>

Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.<lb/>
SONG.<lb/>

Pardon, goddess of the night,<lb/>
Those that slew thy virgin knight;<lb/>
For the which, with songs of woe,<lb/>
Round about her tomb they go.<lb/>
Midnight, assist our moan;<lb/>
Help us to sigh and groan,<lb/>
Heavily, heavily:<lb/>
Graves, yawn and yield your dead,<lb/>
Till death be uttered,<lb/>
Heavily, heavily.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Now, unto thy bones good night!<lb/>
Yearly will I do this rite.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:<lb/>
The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,<lb/>
Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about<lb/>
Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.<lb/>
Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, masters: each his several way.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;<lb/>
And then to Leonato's we will go.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>And Hymen now with luckier issue speed's<lb/>
Than this for whom we render'd up this woe.<lb/>

<head>Scene 4</head>

<p><stage>A room in LEONATO'S house.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, BENEDICK, BEATRICE,	MARGARET, URSULA, FRIAR FRANCIS, and HERO</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>FRIAR FRANCIS</speaker>
<p>Did I not tell you she was innocent?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>So are the prince and Claudio, who accused her<lb/>
Upon the error that you heard debated:<lb/>
But Margaret was in some fault for this,<lb/>
Although against her will, as it appears<lb/>
In the true course of all the question.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>And so am I, being else by faith enforced<lb/>
To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Well, daughter, and you gentle-women all,<lb/>
Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,<lb/>
And when I send for you, come hither mask'd.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt Ladies</stage></p>


<p>
The prince and Claudio promised by this hour<lb/>
To visit me. You know your office, brother:<lb/>
You must be father to your brother's daughter<lb/>
And give her to young Claudio.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR FRANCIS</speaker>
<p>To do what, signior?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>To bind me, or undo me; one of them.<lb/>
Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,<lb/>
Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>And I do with an eye of love requite her.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>The sight whereof I think you had from me,<lb/>
From Claudio and the prince: but what's your will?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Your answer, sir, is enigmatical:<lb/>
But, for my will, my will is your good will<lb/>
May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd<lb/>
In the state of honourable marriage:<lb/>
In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>My heart is with your liking.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR FRANCIS</speaker>
<p>And my help.<lb/>
Here comes the prince and Claudio.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO, and two or	three others</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Good morrow to this fair assembly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio:<lb/>
We here attend you. Are you yet determined<lb/>
To-day to marry with my brother's daughter?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Call her forth, brother; here's the friar ready.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit ANTONIO</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,<lb/>
That you have such a February face,<lb/>
So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>I think he thinks upon the savage bull.<lb/>
Tush, fear not, man; we'll tip thy horns with gold<lb/>
And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,<lb/>
As once Europa did at lusty Jove,<lb/>
When he would play the noble beast in love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;<lb/>
And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,<lb/>
And got a calf in that same noble feat<lb/>
Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter ANTONIO, with the Ladies masked</stage></p>


<p>
Which is the lady I must seize upon?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANTONIO</speaker>
<p>This same is she, and I do give you her.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Why, then she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>No, that you shall not, till you take her hand<lb/>
Before this friar and swear to marry her.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Give me your hand: before this holy friar,<lb/>
I am your husband, if you like of me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>And when I lived, I was your other wife:<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Unmasking</stage></p>


<p>
And when you loved, you were my other husband.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>Another Hero!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>Nothing certainer:<lb/>
One Hero died defiled, but I do live,<lb/>
And surely as I live, I am a maid.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>The former Hero! Hero that is dead!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>FRIAR FRANCIS</speaker>
<p>All this amazement can I qualify:<lb/>
When after that the holy rites are ended,<lb/>
I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death:<lb/>
Meantime let wonder seem familiar,<lb/>
And to the chapel let us presently.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p><stage>[Unmasking]</stage>  I answer to that name. What is your will?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Do not you love me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Why, no; no more than reason.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio<lb/>
Have been deceived; they swore you did.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Do not you love me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Troth, no; no more than reason.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula<lb/>
Are much deceived; for they did swear you did.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>They swore that you were almost sick for me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>No, truly, but in friendly recompense.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;<lb/>
For here's a paper written in his hand,<lb/>
A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,<lb/>
Fashion'd to Beatrice.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HERO</speaker>
<p>And here's another<lb/>
Writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket,<lb/>
Containing her affection unto Benedick.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>A miracle! here's our own hands against our hearts.<lb/>
Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take<lb/>
thee for pity.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BEATRICE</speaker>
<p>I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield<lb/>
upon great persuasion; and partly to save your life,<lb/>
for I was told you were in a consumption.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Peace! I will stop your mouth.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Kissing her</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DON PEDRO</speaker>
<p>How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>I'll tell thee what, prince; a college of<lb/>
wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost<lb/>
thou think I  care for a satire or an epigram? No:<lb/>
if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wear<lb/>
nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do<lb/>
purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any<lb/>
purpose that the world can say against it; and<lb/>
therefore never flout at me for what I have said<lb/>
against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my<lb/>
conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to<lb/>
have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my<lb/>
kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CLAUDIO</speaker>
<p>I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,<lb/>
that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single<lb/>
life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of<lb/>
question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look<lb/>
exceedingly narrowly to thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Come, come, we are friends: let's have a dance ere<lb/>
we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts<lb/>
and our wives' heels.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>LEONATO</speaker>
<p>We'll have dancing afterward.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>First, of my word; therefore play, music. Prince,<lb/>
thou art sad; get thee a wife, get thee a wife:<lb/>
there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter a Messenger</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Messenger</speaker>
<p>My lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight,<lb/>
And brought with armed men back to Messina.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>BENEDICK</speaker>
<p>Think not on him till to-morrow:<lb/>
I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.<lb/>
Strike up, pipers.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Dance</stage>



</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage></p>
