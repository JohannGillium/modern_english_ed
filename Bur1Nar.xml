then to a conclusion the quest of witches in New England, was that which here
follows. The Rev. Deodat Lawson was singularly qualified to write it. He had
himself, only a little earlier (1684-1688), served as pastor to Salem Village, the
rural community in which these happenings took their rise; and, though
dissensions in the parish prevented his longer stay, he seems to have been no
party to these dissensions and must meanwhile have learned to know the scene
and all the actors of that later drama which he here depicts. He was, too, a man
of education, travel, social experience. Born in England, the son of a scholarly
Puritan minister, and doubtless educated there, he first appears in New England
in 1676, and at the time of his call to Salem Village was making his home in
Boston. Thither he returned in 1688: Samuel Sewall, who on May 13 had him in
at Sunday dinner, notes in his diary that he &ldquo;came to Town to dwell last
week,&rdquo; and often mentions him thereafter. How at the outbreak of the
witchpanic he came to revisit the Village and to chronicle the doings there, he
himself a dozen years later thus told his English friends:<ref target="n1">[1]</ref></p>

<q>It pleased God in the Year of our Lord 1692 to visit the People at a place
called Salem Village in New-England, with a very Sore and Grievous Affliction,
in which they had reason to believe, that the Soveraign and Holy God was
pleased to permit Satan and his Instruments, to Affright and Afflict those poor
Mortals in such an Astonishing and Unusual manner.</q>


<pb n="148"/>


<q>Now, I having for some time before attended the work of the Ministry in
that Village, the Report of those Great Afflictions came quickly to my notice; and
the more readily because the first Person Afflicted was in the Minister's Family,
who succeeded me, after I was removed from them; in pitty therefore to my
Christian Friends, and former Acquaintance there, I was much concerned about
them, frequently consulted with them, and fervently (by Divine Assistance)
prayed for them; but especially my Concern was augmented, when it was
Reported, at an Examination of a Person suspected for Witchcraft, that my Wife
and Daughter, who Dyed Three Years before, were sent out of the World under
the Malicious Operations of the Infernal Powers; as is more fully represented in
the following Remarks. I did then Desire, and was also Desired, by some
concerned in the Court, to be there present, that I might hear what was alledged
in that respect; observing therefore, when I was amongst them, that the Case of
the Afflicted was very amazing, and deplorable; and the Charges brought against
the Accused, such as were Ground of Suspicions yet very intricate, and difficult
to draw up right Conclusions about them; I thought good for the satisfaction of
my self, and such of my Friends as might be curious to inquiry into those
Mysteries of Gods Providence and Satans Malice, to draw up and keep by me,
a Brief Account of the most Remarkable things, that came to my Knowledge in
those Affairs; which Remarks were afterwards, (at my Request) Revised and
Corrected by some who Sate Judges on the Bench, in those Matters; and were
now Transcribed, from the same Paper, on which they were then Written.</q>

<p>A narrative so timely and so vouched for must have gone speedily into
print.<ref target="n2">[2]</ref> The latest day named in it &mdash; &ldquo;the 5th of
April&rdquo; &mdash; was probably the date both of its completion and of its
going to press. In 1693 it was reprinted in London by John Dunton, who
appended to it an anonymous &ldquo;Further Account of the Tryals of the
New-England Witches&rdquo; (an extract from &ldquo;a letter from thence to
a Gentleman in London&rdquo;) bringing the story to February, 1693, and to
both joined


<pb n="149"/>


Increase Mather's <hi rend="italic">Cases of Conscience</hi> (see pp.
377, 378, below),prefixing to the volume thus made up the title:
<hi rend="italic">A Further Account of the Tryals of the New-England Witches.
With the Observations of a Person who was upon the Place several Days when
the suspected Witches were first taken into Examination. To which is added,
Cases of Conscience</hi>, etc.<ref target="n3">[3]</ref> In 1704 Lawson, himself now in England, cast
it into a new form as an appendix to the English edition of his Salem
sermon.<ref target="n4">[4]</ref>
All names are now left out, that he &ldquo;may not grieve any, whose Relations
were either Accused or Afflicted, in those times of Trouble and Distress,&rdquo;
and what had been a narrative is given a statistical form under &ldquo;three
Heads, viz. (1.) Relating to the Afflicted, (2.) Relating to the Accused, And (3.)
Relating to the Confessing Witches.&rdquo;<ref target="n5">[5]</ref> On his own views, and the probable
trend of his influence while at Salem, light is thrown by his introductory
words:</p>


<q>After this,<ref target="n6">[6]</ref> I being by the Providence of God called over into England, in
the Year 1696; I then brought that Paper of Remarks on the Witchcraft with me;
upon the sight thereof, some Worthy Ministers and Christian Friends here desired
me to Reprint the Sermon and subjoyn the Remarks thereunto, in way of
Appendix, but for some particular Reasons I did then Decline it; But now,
forasmuch as I my self had been an Eye and Ear Witness of most of those
Amazing things, so far as they come within the Notice of Humane Senses; and
the Requests of my Friends were Renewed since I came to Dwell in London; I
have given way to the Publishing of them; that I may satisfy such as are not
resolved to the Contrary, that there may be (and are) such Operations of the
Powers of Darkness on the


<pb n="150"/>


Bodies and Minds of Mankind, by Divine Permission; and that those who Sate
Judges in those Cases, may by the serious Consideration of the formidable Aspect
and perplexed Circumstances of that Afflictive Providence be in some measure
excused; or at least be less Censured, for passing Sentance on several Persons,
as being the Instruments of Satan in those Diabolical Operations, when they were
involved in such a Dark and Dismal Scene of Providence, in which Satan did
seem to Spin a finer Thred of Spiritual Wickedness than in the ordinary methods
of Witchcraft; hence the Judges desiring to bear due Testimony against such
Diabolical Practices, were inclined to admit the validity of such a sort of
Evidence as was not so clearly and directly demonstrable to Human Senses, as
in other Cases is required, or else they could not discover the Mysteries of
Witchcraft....</q>


<p>One can not read these words without a suspicion that the reaction in New
England against those held responsible for the procedure at Salem may have had
to do with his return to England; and even in England, it is clear, his cause now
needed defense. If any can wish him further ill, let them be appeased by our two
glimpses of his after fate &mdash; a despairing letter in 1714,<ref target="n7">[7]</ref> begging from his
New England friends meat, drink, and clothing for his sick and starving family,
and the passing phrase of a writer who in 1727, mentioning Thomas Lawson,
adds that &ldquo;he was the father of the unhappy Mr. Deodate Lawson, who
came hither from New England.&rdquo;<ref target="n8">[8]</ref></p>



<p>But the reader should not enter on the study of the witchpanic of 1692
without knowing something of our other sources of knowledge. The contemporary
narratives are practically all printed in the pages that follow, and a part of the
trial records will be found embodied in Cotton Mather's
<hi rend="italic">Wonders</hi>;<ref target="n9">[9]</ref> but most of these must be sought otherwhere,
and, alas, they are sadly scattered. Some Governor Hutchinson preserved in


<pb n="151"/>


his wise and careful pages on this subject,<ref target="n10">[10]</ref> where alone a part can now be found.
Many have drifted into private hands &mdash; like those which in 1860 came into
the hands of the Massachusetts Historical Society and are in part printed in its
<hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> (1860-1862, pp. 31-37), or those
published by Drake in the foot-notes and appendices to his various histories and
editions,<ref target="n11">[11]</ref> or those now in the keeping of the Essex Institute at Salem or of the
Boston Public Library.<ref target="n12">[12]</ref> Such of these as are in print are mentioned in the notes
at the proper points. But most are still in public keeping at Salem; and these in
1864 were printed by W. Elliot Woodward in the two volumes of his
<hi rend="italic">Records of Salem Witchcraft</hi>, the work most fundamental
for the first-hand study of this episode. It is, however, imperfect and far from
complete, and there is hope of a better: the <hi rend="italic">Records and
Files of the Quarterly Courts of Essex County</hi>, of which a third volume
has just appeared, must in due course include these witch-trials, and Mr. George
Francis Dow, their editor (who has already by his publication of the witchcraft
records relating to Topsfield<ref target="n13">[13]</ref> shown his keenness in such work), has in mind the
seizing of this opportunity to print all obtainable papers relating to the Salem
Witchcraft episode. Precious documents too are published by Upham in his
classical <hi rend="italic">Salem Witchcraft</hi><ref target="n14">[14]</ref> and in the acute and
learned studies of Mr. Abner C. Goodell and Mr. George H.
Moore.<ref target="n15">[15]</ref></p>

<div3 type="subsection" id="d12">
<head>Narrative</head>

<p><hi rend="small-caps">On</hi> the Nineteenth day of March
last<ref target="n17">[17]</ref> I went to Salem Village,<ref target="n18">[18]</ref> and lodged at Nathaniel Ingersols near to the

<pb n="153"/>

Minister Mr. P's. house,<ref target="n19">[19]</ref> and presently after I came into my Lodging Capt. Walcuts
Daughter Mary<ref target="n20">[20]</ref> came to Lieut. Ingersols and spake to me, but, suddenly after
as she stood by the door, was bitten, so that she cried out of her Wrist, and
looking on it with a Candle, we saw apparently the marks of Teeth both upper
and lower set, on each side of her wrist.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the Evening, I went to give Mr. P.<ref target="n21">[21]</ref> a visit. When I was
there, his Kins-woman, Abigail Williams, (about 12 years of age,) had a grievous
fit; she was at first hurryed with Violence to and fro in the room, (though Mrs.
Ingersol endeavoured to hold her,) sometimes makeing as if she would fly,
stretching up her arms as high as she could, and crying &ldquo;Whish, Whish,
Whish!&rdquo; several times; Presently after she said there was Goodw.
N.<ref target="n22">[22]</ref> and said, &ldquo;Do you not see her? Why there she stands!&rdquo; And the said
Goodw. N. offered her The Book, but she was resolved she would not

<pb n="154"/>

take it, saying Often, &ldquo;I wont, I wont, I wont, take it, I do not know what
Book it is: I am sure it is none of Gods Book, it is the Divels Book, for ought I
know.&rdquo; After that, she run to the Fire, and begun to throw Fire Brands,
about the house; and run against the Back, as if she would run up Chimney, and,
as they said, she had attempted to go into the Fire in other Fits.</p>

<p>On Lords Day, the Twentieth of March, there were sundry of the afflicted
Persons at Meeting, as, Mrs. Pope, and Goodwife Bibber, Abigail Williams.
Mary Walcut, Mary Lewes, and Docter Griggs' Maid.<ref target="n23">[23]</ref> There was also at
Meeting, Goodwife C.<ref target="n24">[24]</ref> (who was afterward Examined on suspicion of being a
Witch:) They had several Sore Fits, in the time of Publick Worship, which did
something interrupt me in my First Prayer; being so unusual. After Psalm was
Sung, Abigail Williams said to me, &ldquo;Now stand up, and Name your
Text&rdquo;: And after it was read, she said, &ldquo;It is a long Text.&rdquo;
In the beginning of Sermon, Mrs. Pope, a Woman afflicted, said to me,
&ldquo;Now there is enough of that.&rdquo; And in the afternoon, Abigail
Williams upon my referring to my Doctrine said to me, &ldquo;I know no
Doctrine you had, If you did name one, I have forgot it.&rdquo;</p>


<p>In Sermon time when Goodw. C was present in the Meetinghouse Ab. W.
called out, &ldquo;Look where Goodw. C sits on the Beam suckling her Yellow
bird betwixt her fingers&rdquo;! Anne Putnam another Girle afflicted said there
was a Yellow-bird sat on my hat as it hung on the Pin in the Pulpit: but those that
were by, restrained her from speaking loud about it.</p>


<p>On Monday the 21st of March, The Magistrates of Salem appointed to
come to Examination of Goodw C.<ref target="n25">[25]</ref> And about

<pb n="155"/>

twelve of the Clock, they went into the Meeting-House, which was Thronged with
Spectators: Mr. Noyes<ref target="n26">[26]</ref> began with a very pertinent and pathetic Prayer; and
Goodwife C. being called to answer to what was Alledged against her, she
desired to go to Prayer, which was much wondred at, in the presence of so many
hundred people: The Magistrates told her, they would not admit it; they came not
there to hear her Pray, but to Examine her, in what was Alledged against her.
The Worshipful Mr. Hathorne<ref target="n27">[27]</ref> asked her, Why she Afflicted those Children? she
said, she did not Afflict them. He asked her, who did then? she said, &ldquo;I
do not know; How should I know?&rdquo; The Number of the Afflicted Persons
were about that time Ten, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. Four Married
Women, Mrs. Pope, Mrs. Putman,<ref target="n28">[28]</ref> Goodw. Bibber, and an Ancient Woman,
named Goodall, three Maids, Mary Walcut, Mercy Lewes, at Thomas Putman's,
and a Maid at Dr. Griggs's, there were three Girls from 9 to 12 Years of Age,
each of them, or thereabouts, <hi rend="italic">viz</hi>. Elizabeth Parris,
Abigail Williams and Ann Putman; these were most of them at G. C's
Examination, and did vehemently accuse her in the Assembly of afflicting them,
by Biting, Pinching, Strangling, etc. And that they did in their Fit see her
Likeness coming to them, and bringing a Book to them, she said, she had no
Book; they affirmed, she had a Yellow-Bird, that used to suck betwixt her
Fingers, and being asked about it, if she had any Familiar Spirit, that attended
her, she said, She had no Familiarity with any such thing. She was a Gospel
Woman: which Title she called her self by; and the Afflicted Persons told her,
ah! She was, A Gospel Witch. Ann Putman did there affirm, that one day when
Lieutenant Fuller was at

<pb n="156"/>




Prayer at her Fathers House, she saw the shape of Goodw. C. and she thought
Goodw. N. Praying at the same time to the Devil, she was not sure it was
Goodw. N. she thought it was; but very sure she saw the Shape of G. C. The
said C. said, they were poor, distracted Children, and no heed to be given to
what they said. Mr. Hathorne and Mr. Noyes replyed, it was the judgment of all
that were present, they were Bewitched, and only she, the Accused Person said,
they were Distracted. It was observed several times, that if she did but bite her
Under lip in time of Examination the persons afflicted were bitten on their armes
and wrists and produced the Marks before the Magistrates, Ministers and others.
And being watched for that, if she did but Pinch her Fingers, or Graspe one hand
hard in another, they were Pinched and produced the Marks before the
Magistrates, and Spectators. After that, it was observed, that if she did but lean
her Breast against the Seat, in the Meeting House, (being the Barr at which she
stood,) they were afflicted. Particularly Mrs. Pope complained of grievous
torment in her Bowels as if they were torn out. She vehemently accused said C.
as the instrument, and first threw her Muff at her; but that flying not home, she
got off her Shoe, and hit Goodwife C. on the head with it. After these postures
were watched, if said C. did but stir her feet, they were afflicted in their Feet,
and stamped fearfully. The afflicted persons asked her why she did not go to the
company of Witches which were before the Meeting house mustering? Did she
not hear the Drum beat? They accused her of having Familiarity with the Devil,
in the time of Examination, in the shape of a Black man whispering in her ear;
they affirmed, that her Yellow-Bird sucked betwixt her Fingers in the Assembly;
and order being given to see if there were any sign, the Girl that saw it said, it
was too late now; she had removed a Pin, and put it on her head; which was
found there sticking upright.</p>


<p>They told her, she had Covenanted with the Devil for ten years, six of them
were gone, and four more to come. She was required by the Magistrates to
answer that Question in the Catechism, &ldquo;How many persons be there in
the God-Head?&rdquo; she answered it but oddly, yet was there no great thing
to be gathered from it; she denied all that was charged upon her,

<pb n="157"/>




and said, They could not prove a Witch; she was that Afternoon Committed to
Salem-Prison; and after she was in Custody, she did not so appear to them, and
afflict them as before.</p>


<p>On Wednesday the 23 of March, I went to Thomas Putmans, on purpose
to see his Wife: I found her lying on the Bed, having had a sore fit a little before.
She spake to me, and said, she was glad to see me; her Husband and she both
desired me to pray with her, while she was sensible; which I did, though the
Apparition said, I should not go to Prayer. At the first beginning she attended;
but after a little time, was taken with a fit: yet continued silent, and seemed to
be Asleep: when Prayer was done, her Husband going to her, found her in a Fit;
he took her off the Bed, to set her on his Knees; but at first she was so stiff, she
could not be bended; but she afterwards set down; but quickly began to strive
violently with her Arms and Leggs; she then began to Complain of, and as it
were to Converse personally with, Goodw. N., saying, &ldquo;Goodw. N. Be
gone! Be gone! Be gone! are you not ashamed, a Woman of your Profession, to
afflict a poor Creature so? what hurt did I ever do you in my life! you have but
two years to live, and then the Devil will torment your Soul, for this your Name
is blotted out of Gods Book, and it shall never be put in Gods Book again, be
gone for shame, are you not afraid of that which is coming upon you? I Know,
I know, what will make you afraid; the wrath of an Angry God, I am sure that
will make you afraid; be gone, do not tourment me, I know what you would have
(we judged she meant, her Soul) but it is out of your reach; it is Clothed with the
white Robes of Christs Righteousness.&rdquo; After this, she seemed to dispute
with the Apparition about a particular Text of Scripture. The Apparition seemed
to deny it, (the Womans eyes being fast closed all this time); she said, She was
sure there was such a Text; and she would tell it; and then the Shape would be
gone, for said she, &ldquo;I am sure you cannot stand before that Text!&rdquo;
then she was sorely Afflicted; her mouth drawn on one side, and her body
strained for about a minute, and then said, &ldquo;I will tell, I will tell; it is, it
is, it is!&rdquo; three or four times, and then was afflicted to hinder her from
telling, at last she broke forth and said, &ldquo;It is the third Chapter of the
Revelations.&rdquo; I did something scruple the reading it, and did let my
scruple ap

pear, lest Satan should make any Superstitious lie to improve the Word of the
Eternal God. However, tho' not versed in these things, I judged I might do it this
once for an Experiment. I began to read, and before I had near read through the
first verse, she opened her eyes, and was well; this fit continued near half an
hour. Her Husband and the Spectators told me, she had often been so relieved by
reading Texts that she named, something pertinent to her Case; as Isa. 40. 1, Isa.
49. 1, Isa. 50. 1, and several others.</p>


<p>On Thursday the Twenty fourth of march, (being in course the Lecture
Day, at the Village,) Goodwife N. was brought before the Magistrates Mr.
Hathorne and Mr. Corwin,<ref target="n29">[29]</ref> about Ten of
[the] Clock, in the Fore Noon, to be
Examined in the Meeting House; the Reverend Mr. Hale<ref target="n30">[30]</ref> begun with Prayer, and
the Warrant being read, she was required to give answer, Why she aflicted those
persons? she pleaded her owne innocency with earnestness. Thomas Putman's
Wife, Abigail Williams and Thomas Putmans daughter accused her that she
appeared to them, and afflicted them in their fitts: but some of the other said, that
they had seen her, but knew not that ever she had hurt them; amongst which was
Mary Walcut, who was presently after she had so declared bitten, and cryed out
of her in the meeting-house; producing the Marks of teeth on her wrist. It was so
disposed, that I had not leisure to attend the whole time of
Examination,<ref target="n31">[31]</ref> but
both Magistrates

<pb n="159"/>




and Ministers told me, that the things alledged by the afflicted, and defences
made by her, were much after the same manner, as the former was. And her
Motions did produce like effects as to Biteing, Pinching, Bruising, Tormenting,
at their Breasts, by her Leaning, and when, bended Back, were as if their Backs
was broken. The afflicted persons said, the Black Man whispered to her in the
Assembly, and therefore she could not hear what the Magistrates said unto her.
They said also that she did then ride by the Meeting-house, behind the Black
Man. Thomas Putman's wife had a grievous Fit, in the time of Examination, to
the very great Impairing of her strength, and wasting of her spirits, insomuch as
she could hardly move hand, or foot, when she was carryed out. Others also were
there grievously afflicted, so that there was once such an hideous scrietch and
noise, (which I heard as I walked, at a little distance from the Meeting house,)
as did amaze me, and some that were within told me the whole assembly was
struck with consternation, and they were afraid, that those that sate next to them,
were under the influence of Witchcraft. This woman also was that day committed
to Salem Prison. The Magistrates and Ministers also did informe me, that they
apprehended a child of Sarah G.<ref target="n32">[32]</ref> and Examined it, being between 4 and 5 years
of Age, And as to matter of Fact, they did Unanimously affirm, that when this
Child did but cast its eye upon the afflicted persons, they were tormented, and
they held her Head, and yet so many as her eye could fix upon were afflicted.
Which they did several times make careful observation of: the afflicted
complained, they had often been Bitten by this child, and produced the marks of
a small set of teeth, accordingly, this was also committed to Salem Prison; the
child looked hail, and well as other Children. I saw it at Lieut.
Ingersols.<ref target="n33">[33]</ref> After
the commitment of Goodw. N., Tho: Putmans wife was much better, and had no
violent fits

<pb n="160"/>




at all from that 24th of March to the 5th of April. Some others also said they had
not seen her so frequently appear to them, to hurt them.</p>


<p>On the 25th of March, (as Capt. Stephen Sewal,<ref target="n34">[34]</ref> of Salem, did afterwards
inform me) Eliza. Paris had sore Fits, at his house, which much troubled himself,
and his wife, so as he told me they were almost discouraged. She related, that the
great Black Man came to her, and told her, if she would be ruled by him, she
should have whatsoever she desired, and go to a Golden City. She relating this
to Mrs. Sewall, she told the child, it was the Divel, and he was a Lyar from the
Beginning, and bid her tell him so, if he came again: which she did accordingly,
at the next coming to her, in her fits.</p>


<p>On the 26th of March, Mr. Hathorne, Mr. Corwin, and Mr.
Higison<ref target="n35">[35]</ref> were
at the Prison-Keepers House, to Examine the Child,<ref target="n36">[36]</ref> and it told them there, it
had a little Snake that used to Suck on the lowest Joynt of it[s] Fore-Finger; and
when they inquired where, pointing to other places, it told them, not there, but
there, pointing on the Lowest point of Fore-Finger; where they Observed a deep
Red Spot, about the Bigness of a Flea-bite, they asked who gave it that Snake?
whether the great Black man, it said no, its Mother gave it.</p>


<p>The 31 of March there was a Publick Fast kept at Salem on account of
these Afflicted Persons. And Abigail Williams said, that the Witches had a
Sacrament that day at an house in the Village, and that they had Red Bread and
Red Drink. The first of April, Mercy Lewis, Thomas Putman's Maid, in her fitt,
said, they did eat Red Bread like Mans Flesh, and

<pb n="161"/>




would have had her eat some: but she would not; but turned away her head, and
Spit at them, and said, &ldquo;I will not Eat, I will not Drink, it is
Blood,&rdquo; etc. She said, &ldquo;That is not the Bread of Life, that is not the
Water of Life; Christ gives the Bread of Life, I will have none of it!&rdquo; This
first of April also Marcy Lewis aforesaid saw in her fitt a White man and was
with him in a Glorious Place, which had no Candles nor Sun, yet was full of
Light and Brightness; where was a great Multitude in White glittering Robes, and
they Sung the Song in the fifth of Revelation the Ninth verse, and the 110 Psalm,
and the 149 Psalm; and said with her self, &ldquo;How long shall I stay here?
let me be along with you&rdquo;: She was loth to leave this place, and grieved
that she could tarry no longer. This Whiteman<ref target="n37">[37]</ref> hath appeared several times to
some of them, and given them notice how long it should be before they had
another Fit, which was sometimes a day, or day and half, or more or less: it hath
fallen out accordingly.</p>


<p>The third of April, the Lords-Day, being Sacrament-day, at the Village,
Goodw. C.<ref target="n38">[38]</ref> upon Mr. Parris's naming his Text, John 6, 70, <hi
rend="italic">One of them is a Devil</hi>, the said Goodw. C. went
immediately out of the Meeting-House, and flung the door after her violently, to
the amazement of the Congregation: She was afterward seen by some in their
Fits, who said, &ldquo;O Goodw. C., I did not think to see you here!&rdquo;
(and being at their Red bread and drink) said to her, &ldquo;Is this a time to
receive the Sacrament, you ran-away on the Lords-Day, and scorned to receive
it in the Meeting-House, and, Is this a time to receive it? I wonder at
you!&rdquo; This is the summ of what I either saw my self, or did receive
Information from persons of undoubted Reputation and Credit.</p>

a rural district (what is now the township of Danvers, with parts of the townships

year, at the request of its inhabitants, was set off as a separate parish, though not
as a distinct town. Despite the name of &ldquo;village,&rdquo; there was in
Salem Village no huddle of houses amounting to a hamlet, though about the
meeting-house (where now is Danvers Highlands) the farm-houses clustered more
thickly than elsewhere. Prefixed to the Rev. Charles W. Upham's

in the Salem panic was to be so great, had been at Salem Village since 1688,
succeeding Deodat Lawson as its spiritual head. Till then, though educated at
Harvard, which is to say for the ministry, he had been engaged in the West
Indian trade, and had lived for a time in Barbadoes, whence he had brought back
with him the two slaves, John and Tituba, perhaps half negro, half native, with
whom we must soon have to do. Abigail Williams, his niece, was a member of
his household; and we shall meet also his little daughter Elizabeth, aged nine. The
account of his life by S. P. Fowler (Essex Institute,

(Salem, 1857) and is appended to Drake's ed. of Mather and Calef (III. 198-222).

daughter, both named Ann, were also to have a leading part among &ldquo;the

Village, who had first pronounced the girls bewitched.</p></note>

all the legal documents connected with these cases, the student must of course
turn to the publications embodying such court records (see p. 151,
above).  Those of Goodwife Corey's case may be found in Woodward's
<hi rend="italic">Records of Salem Witchcraft</hi>, I. 50-60. Especially
interesting is the evidence as to her rational attitude: &ldquo;shee told us,&rdquo;
testify those who went to arrest her, &ldquo;that shee did not thinke that there
were any witches.&rdquo; They add that it &ldquo;was said of her that shee
would open the eyes of the magistrates and ministers.&rdquo;</p></note>

<note id="n31"><seg type="note-symbol">[31].</seg> <p>What drew Mr. Lawson away from the examinations was doubtless the
need to complete his preparation for the important sermon of that day; and it must
have been this on which he was pondering when (as he records a few lines later)
the shrieks of the afflicted reached him as he walked, &ldquo;a little distance
from the meeting-house.&rdquo; That sermon was, however, no extempore
production, but a studied disquisition on the power and malice of the Devil, who
&ldquo;Contracts and Indents with Witches and Wizzards, that they shall be the
Instruments by whom he may more secretly Affect and Afflict the Bodies and
Minds of others.&rdquo; &ldquo;And the Devil,&rdquo; taught Lawson,
committing himself wholly to belief in the worth of that &ldquo;spectral
evidence&rdquo; which was to play such a part in the Salem episode,
&ldquo;having them in his subjection, by their Consent, he will use their Bodies
and Minds, Shapes and Representations, to Affright and Afflict others at his
pleasure.&rdquo; The magistrates were present at the sermon; and to them he
dedicated the sermon when, in the following year, he gave it to the press under
the title of <hi rend="italic">Christ's Fidelity the only Shield against Satan's
Malignity</hi>. A second edition was printed under his eye at London in 1704

father alleged &ldquo;that she hath ever since been very chargeable, haveing little

some connection with his being one of the most ardent furtherers of the trials. It
was from him that Cotton Mather later asked the materials for his account of
them (see p. 206, below). He must, of course, not be confused with his more

<head>Remarks of things more than ordinary about the Afflicted Persons.</head>


<p>1. They are in their Fits tempted to be Witches, are shewed the List of the
Names of others, and are tortured, because they will not yield to Subscribe, or
meddle with, or touch the Book, and are promised to have present Relief if they
would do it.</p>

<pb n="162"/>

<p>2. They did in the Assembly mutually Cure each other, even with a Touch
of their Hand, when Strangled, and otherwise Tortured; and would endeavour to
get to their Afflicted, to Relieve them.</p>


<p>3. They did also foretel when anothers Fit was a-coming, and would say,
&ldquo;Look to her! she will have a Fit presently,&rdquo; which fell out
accordingly, as many can bear witness, that heard and saw it.</p>


<p>4. That at the same time, when the Accused Person was present, the
Afflicted Persons saw her Likeness in other places of the Meeting-House,
suckling her Familiar, sometimes in one place and posture, and sometimes in
another.</p>


<p>5. That their Motions in their Fits are Preternatural, both as to the manner,
which is so strange as a well person could not Screw their Body into; and as to
the violence also it is preternatural, being much beyond the Ordinary force of the
same person when they are in their right mind.</p>


<p>6. The eyes of some of them in their fits are exceeding fast closed, and if
you ask a question they can give no answer, and I do believe they cannot hear at
that time, yet do they plainely converse with the Appearances, as if they did
discourse with real persons.</p>


<p>7. They are utterly pressed against any persons Praying with them, and told
by the appearances, they shall not go to Prayer, so Tho. Putmans wife was told,
I should not Pray; but she said, I should: and after I had done, reasoned with the
Appearance, &ldquo;Did not I say he should go to Prayer?&rdquo;</p>


<p>8. The forementioned Mary W.<ref target="n39">[39]</ref> being a little better at ease, the Afflicted
persons said, she had signed the book; and that was the reason she was better.
Told me by Edward Putman.<ref target="n40">[40]</ref></p>

<head>Remarks concerning the Accused.</head>


<p>1. For introduction to the discovery of those that afflicted them, It is
reported Mr. Parris's Indian Man and Woman made a Cake of Rye Meal, and the
Childrens water, baked it

<pb n="163"/>

in the Ashes, and gave it to a Dogge, since which they have discovered, and seen
particular persons hurting of them.</p>


<p>2. In Time of Examination, they seemed little affected, though all the
Spectators were much grieved to see it.</p>


<p>3. Natural Actions in them produced Preternatural actions in the
Afflicted, so that they are their own Image without any Poppits of Wax
or otherwise.<ref target="n41">[41]</ref>

</p><p>4. That they are accused to have a Company about 23 or 24 and they did
Muster in Armes, as it seemed to the Afflicted Persons.

</p><p>5. Since they were confined, the Persons have not been so much
Afflicted with their appearing to them, Biteing or Pinching of them,
etc.

</p><p>6. They are reported by the Afflicted Persons to keep dayes of Fast
and dayes of Thanksgiving, and Sacraments;. Satan endeavours to
Transforme himself to an Angel of Light, and to make his Kingdom and
Administrations to resemble those of our Lord Jesus Christ.

</p><p>7. Satan Rages Principally amongst the Visible Subjects of Christ's
Kingdom and makes use (at least in appearance) of some of them to
Afflict others; that Christ's Kingdom may be divided against it self,
and so be weakened.

</p><p>8. Several things used in England at Tryal of Witches, to the Number
of 14 or 15, which are wont to pass instead of or in Concurrence with
Witnesses, at least 6 or 7 of them are found in these accused: see
Keebles Statutes.<ref target="n42">[42]</ref>

<pb n="164"/>

</p><p>9. Some of the most solid Alflicted Persons do affirme the same things
concerning seeing the accused out of their Fitts as well as in them.

</p><p>10. The Witches had a Fast, and told one of the Afflicted Girles, she
must not Eat, because it was Fast Day, she said, she would: they told
her they would Choake her then; which when she did eat, was
endeavoured.</p>

<note id="n41"><seg type="note-symbol">[41]</seg> <p><hi rend="italic">I. e</hi>.,these witches have no need, as do others (see p.
104), to make images, or puppets, in the likeness of those they wish

their victims are preternaturally compelled to the same action.

<note id="n42"><seg type="note-symbol">[42]</seg> <p>What is meant is clearly not the collection of English statutes
compiled by Joseph Keeble, or Keble, (1632-1710). Often printed (1676,
1681, 1684, 1695, 1706), this seems to have been standard in the colonies as at home;
but it contains absolutely nothing but the text of the statutes in
force, &ldquo;with the titles of such as are expired, repealed,
altered, or out of use,&rdquo; and at the end an analytical table of
subjects.&rdquo; The work really meant is Keble's <hi rend="italic">An Assistance to Justices of the Peace</hi> (London,
1683, 1689). This work, however, borrows its pages on witchcraft (pp.
217-220) from the older manuals of Lambarde, West, and Dalton; and the
passage in question is one compiled by Michael Dalton, for the later
