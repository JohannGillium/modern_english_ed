<head>Preface</head>

<pb n="v"/>

<p><hi rend="bold">I</hi> HAVE been asked to write a preface to these Legends of
Vancouver, which, in conjunction with the members of the Publication
Sub-committee &mdash; Mrs. Lefevre, Mr. L. W. Makovski and Mr. R. W.  Douglas
&mdash; I have helped to put through the press.  But scarcely any prefatory
remarks are necessary.  This book may well stand on its own merits.
Still, it may be permissible to record one's glad satisfaction that a
poet has arisen to cast over the shoulders of our grey mountains, our
trail-threaded forests, our tide-swept waters, and the streets and
skyscrapers of our hurrying city, a gracious mantle of romance.  Pauline
Johnson has linked the vivid present with the immemorial past.
Vancouver takes on a new aspect as we view it through her eyes.  In the
imaginative power that she has brought to these semi-historical sagas,
and in the liquid flow of her rhythmical prose, she has shown herself to
be a literary worker of whom we may well be proud: she has made a most
estimable contribution to purely Canadian literature.<lb/>

<head>Author's Foreword</head>

<p>THESE legends (with two or three exceptions) were told to me
personally by my honored friend, the late Chief Joe Capilano, of
Vancouver, whom I had the privilege of first meeting in London in 1906,
when he visited England and was received at Buckingham Palace by their
Majesties King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra.

</p><p>To the fact that I was able to greet Chief Capilano in the
Chinook tongue, while we were both many thousands of miles from home, I
owe the friendship and the confidence which he so freely gave me when I
came to reside on the Pacific Coast.  These legends he told me from time
to time, just as the mood possessed him, and he frequently remarked that
they had never been revealed to any other Englishspeaking person save
myself.<lb/> <q>E. PAULINE JOHNSON (Tekahionwake)</q></p>

<head>Biographical Notice</head>

<p>E. PAULINE JOHNSON (Tekahionwake) is the youngest child of a
family of four born to the late G. H. M. Johnson (Onwanonsyshon), Head
Chief of the Six Nations Indians, and his wife Emily S. Howells.  The
latter was of English parentage, her birthplace being Bristol, but the
land of her adoption Canada.

</p><p>Chief Johnson was of the renowned Mohawk tribe, being a scion of
one of the fifty noble families which composed the historical
confederation founded by Hiawatha upwards of four hundred years ago, and
known at that period as the Brotherhood of the Five Nations, but which
was afterwards named the Iroquois by the early French missionaries and
explorers.  For their loyalty to the British Crown they were granted the
magnificent lands bordering the Grand River, in the County of Brant,
Ontario, on which the tribes still live.

</p><p>It was upon this Reserve, on her father's estate, "Chiefswood,"
that Pauline Johnson was born.  The loyalty of her ancestors breathes in
her prose, as well as in her poetic writings.

</p><p>Her education was neither extensive nor elaborate.  It embraced
neither high school nor college.  A nursery governess for two years at
home, three years at an Indian day school half a mile from her home, and
two years in the Central School of the city of Brantford, was the extent
of her educational training.  But, besides this, she acquired a wide
general knowledge, having been through childhood and early girlhood a
great reader, especially of poetry.  Before she was twelve years old she
had read Scott, Longfellow, Byron, Shakespeare, and such books as
Addison's "Spectator," Foster's Essays and Owen Meredith's writings.

</p><p>The first periodicals to accept her poems and place them before
the public were "Gems of Poetry," a small magazine published in New
York, and "The Week," established by the late Prof. Goldwin Smith, of
Toronto, the New York "Independent" and Toronto "Saturday Night."  Since
then she has contributed to most of the high-grade magazines, both on
this continent and England.

</p><p>Her writings having brought her into notice, the next step in
Miss Johnson's career was her appearance on the public platform as a
reciter of her own poems.  For this she had natural talent, and in the
exercise of it she soon developed a marked ability, joined with a
personal magnetism, that was destined to make her a favorite with
audiences from the Atlantic to the Pacific.  Her friend, Mr. Frank
Yeigh, of Toronto, provided for a series of recitals having that scope,
with the object of enabling her to go to England to arrange for the
publication of her

<pb n="x"/>

poems.  Within two years this aim was accomplished, her book of poems,
"The White Wampum," being published by John Lane, of the Bodley Head.
She took with her numerous letters of introduction, including one from
the Governor-General, the Earl of Aberdeen, and she soon gained both
social and literary standing.  Her book was received with much favor,
both by reviewers and the public.  After giving many recitals in
fashionable drawingrooms, she returned to Canada, and made her first
tour to the Pacific Coast, giving recitals at all the cities and towns
en route.  Since then she has crossed the Rocky Mountains no fewer than
nineteen times.

</p><p>Miss Johnson's pen had not been idle, and in 1903 the George
Morang Co., of Toronto, published her second book of poems, entitled
"Canadian Born," which was also well received.

</p><p>After a number of recitals, which included Newfoundland and the
Maritime Provinces, she went to England again in 1906 and made her first
appearance in Steinway Hall, under the distinguished patronage of Lord
and Lady Strathcona.  In the following year she again visited London,
returning by way of the United States, where she gave many recitals.
After another tour of Canada she decided to give up public work, to make
Vancouver, B. C., her home, and to devote herself to literary work.

</p><p>Only a woman of remarkable powers of endurance could have borne
up under the hardships necessarily encountered in travelling through
North-western Canada in pioneer days as Miss Johnson did; and shortly
after settling down in Vancouver the exposure and hardship she had
endured began to tell on her, and her health completely broke down.  For
almost a year she has been an invalid, and as she is unable to attend to
the business herself, a trust has been formed by some of the leading
citizens of her adopted city for the purpose of collecting and
publishing for her benefit her later works.  Among these are the
beautiful Indian Legends contained in this volume, which she has been at
great pains to collect, and a series of boys' stories, which have been
exceedingly well received by magazine readers.

</p><p>During the sixteen years Miss Johnson was travelling, she had
many varied and interesting experiences.  She travelled the old
Battleford trail before the railroad went through, and across the
Boundary country in British Columbia in the romantic days of the early
pioneers.  Once she took an eight hundred and fifty mile drive up the
Cariboo trail to the gold fields.  She has always been an ardent
canoeist, and has run many strange rivers, crossed many a lonely lake,
and camped in many an unfrequented place.  These venturesome trips she
made more from her inherent love of Nature and adventure than from any
necessity of her profession.</p>

<head>The Two Sisters: The Lions</head>

<p>YOU can see them as you look towards the north and the west, where
the dream hills swim into the sky amid their ever-drifting clouds of
pearl and grey.  They catch the earliest hint of sunrise, they hold the
last color of sunset.  Twin mountains they are, lifting their twin peaks
above the fairest city in all Canada, and known throughout the British
Empire as "The Lions of Vancouver."

</p><p>Sometimes the smoke of forest fires blurs them until they gleam
like opals in a purple atmosphere, too beautiful for words to paint.
Sometimes the slanting rains festoon scarfs of mist about their crests,
and the peaks fade into shadowy outlines, melting, melting, forever
melting into the distances.  But for most days in the year the sun
circles the twin glories with a sweep of gold.  The moon washes them
with a torrent of silver.  Oftentimes, when the city is shrouded in
rain, the sun yellows their snows to a deep orange, but through sun and
shadow they stand immovable, smiling westward above the waters of the
restless Pacific, eastward above the superb beauty of the Capilano
Canyon.  But the Indian tribes do now know these peaks as "The Lions."
Even the Chief, whose feet have so recently wandered to the Happy
Hunting Grounds, never heard the name given them until I mentioned it to
him one dreamy August day, as together we followed the trail leading to
the canyon.  He seemed so surprised at the name that I mentioned the
reason it had been applied to them, asking him if he recalled the
Landseer Lions in Trafalgar Square.  Yes, he remembered those splendid
sculptures, and his quick eye saw the resemblance instantly.  It seemed
to please him, and his fine face expressed the haunting memories of the
faraway roar of Old London.  But the "call of the blood" was stronger,
and presently he referred to the Indian legend of those peaks &mdash; a

<pb n="2"/>


legend that I have reason to believe is absolutely unknown to thousands
of Palefaces who look upon "The Lions" daily, without the love for them
that is in the Indian heart; without knowledge of the secret of "The Two
Sisters.  The legend was far more fascinating as it left his lips in the
quaint broken English that is never so dulcet as when it slips from an
Indian tongue.  His inimitable gestures, strong, graceful,
comprehensive, were like a perfectly chosen frame embracing a delicate
painting, and his brooding eyes were as the light in which the picture
hung.  "Many thousands of years ago," he began, "there were no twin
peaks like sentinels guarding the outposts of this sunset coast.  They
were placed there long after the first creation, when the Sagalie Tyee
moulded the mountains, and patterned the mighty rivers where the salmon
run, because of His love for His Indian children, and His Wisdom for
their necessities.  In those times there were many and mighty Indian
tribes along the Pacific -in the mountain ranges, at the shores and
sources of the great Fraser River.  Indian law ruled the land.  Indian
customs prevailed.  Indian beliefs were regarded.  Those were the
legend-making ages when great things occurred to make the traditions we
repeat to our children today.  Perhaps the greatest of these traditions
is the story of 'The Two Sisters,' for they are known to us as 'The
Chief's Daughters,' and to them we owe the Great Peace in which we live,
and have lived for many countless moons.  There is an ancient custom
amongst the Coast tribes that when our daughters step from childhood
into the great world of womanhood the occasion must be made one of
extreme rejoicing.  The being who possesses the possibility of someday
mothering a man child, a warrior, a brave, receives much consideration
in most nations, but to us, the Sunset Tribes, she is honored above all
people.  The parents usually give a great potlatch, and a feast that
lasts many days.  The entire tribe and the surrounding tribes are bidden
to this festival.  More than that, sometimes when a great

<pb n="3"/>

Tyee celebrates for his daughter, the tribes from far up the coast, from
the distant north, from inland, from the island, from the Cariboo
country, are gathered as guests to the feast.  During these days of
rejoicing, the girl is placed in a high seat, an exalted position, for
is she not marriageable?  And does not marriage mean motherhood?  And
does not motherhood mean a vaster nation of brave sons and of gentle
daughters, who, in their turn, will give us sons and daughters of their
own?

</p><p>"But it was many thousands of years ago that a great Tyee had two
daughters that grew to womanhood at the same springtime, when the first
great run of salmon thronged the rivers, and the ollallie bushes were
heavy with blossoms.  These two daughters were young, lovable, and oh!
very beautiful.  Their father, the great Tyee, prepared to make a feast
such as the Coast had never seen.  There were to be days and days of
rejoicing, the people were to come for many leagues, were to bring gifts
to the girls and to receive gifts of great value from the Chief, and
hospitality was to reign as long as pleasuring feet could dance, and
enjoying lips could laugh, and mouths partake of the excellence of the
Chief's fish, game and ollallies.

</p><p>"The only shadow on the joy of it all was war, for the tribe of
the great Tyee was at war with the Upper Coast Indians, those who lived
north, near what is named by the Paleface as the port of Prince Rupert.
Giant war canoes slipped along the entire coast, war parties paddled up
and down, war songs broke the silences of the nights, hatred, vengeance,
strife, horror festered everywhere like sores on the surface of the
earth.  But the great Tyee, after warring for weeks, turned and laughed
at the battle and the bloodshed, for he had been victor in every
encounter, and he could well afford to leave the strife for a brief week
and feast in his daughters' honor, nor permit any mere enemy to come
between him and the traditions of his race and household.  So he turned
insultingly deaf ears to their war cries; he ignored with arrogant
indifference

<pb n="4"/>

their paddle dips that encroached within his own coast waters, and he
prepared as a great Tyee should, to royally entertain his tribesmen in
honor of his daughters.

</p><p>"But seven suns before the great feast these two maidens came
before him, hand clasped in hand.

</p><p>"'Oh! our father,' they said, 'may we speak?'

</p><p>"'Speak, my daughters, my girls with the eyes of April, the
hearts of June'" (early spring and early summer would be the more
accurate Indian phrasing).

</p><p>"'Some day, Oh! our father, we may mother a man child, who may
grow to be just such a powerful Tyee as you are, and for this honor that
may some day be ours we have come to crave a favor of you &mdash; you, Oh!
our father.'

</p><p>"'It is your privilege at this celebration to receive any favor
your hearts may wish,' he replied graciously, placing his fingers
beneath their girlish chins.  'The favor is yours before you ask it, my
daughters.'

</p><p>"'Will you, for our sakes, invite the great northern hostile
tribes &mdash; the tribe you war upon &mdash; to this, our feast?' they asked
fearlessly.

</p><p>"'To a peaceful feast, a feast in the honor of women?' he
exclaimed incredulously.

</p><p>"'So we would desire it,' they answered.

</p><p>"'And so shall it be,' he declared.  'I can deny you nothing this
day, and some time you may bear sons to bless this peace you have asked,
and to bless their mother's sire for granting it.'  Then he turned to
all the young men of the tribe and commanded, 'Build fires at sunset on
all the coast headlands &mdash; fires of welcome.  Man your canoes and face
the north, greet the enemy, and tell them that I, the Tyee of the
Capilanos, ask &mdash; no, command that they join me for a great feast in
honor of my two daughters.'  And when the northern tribes got this
invitation they flocked down the coast to this feast of a Great Peace.
They brought their women and their children: they brought game and fish,
gold and white stone beads, baskets and carven ladles, and wonderful
woven blankets to lay at the feet of their now

<pb n="5"/>

acknowledged ruler, the great Tyee.  And he, in turn, gave such a
potlatch that nothing but tradition can vie with it.  There were long,
glad days of joyousness, long pleasurable nights of dancing and camp
fires, and vast quantities of food.  The war canoes were emptied of
their deadly weapons and filled with the daily catch of salmon.  The
hostile war songs ceased, and in their place were heard the soft shuffle
of dancing feet, the singing voices of women, the play-games of the
children of two powerful tribes which had been until now ancient
enemies, for a great and lasting brotherhood was sealed between them &mdash;
their war songs were ended forever.

</p><p>"Then the Sagalie Tyee smiled on His Indian children: 'I will
make these young-eyed maidens immortal,' He said.  In the cup of His
hands He lifted the Chief's two daughters and set them forever in a high
place, for they had borne two offspring &mdash; Peace and Brotherhood &mdash; each
of which is now a great Tyee ruling this land.

</p><p>"And on the mountain crest the Chief's daughters can be seen
wrapped in the suns, the snows, the stars of all seasons, for they have
stood in this high place for thousands of years, and will stand for
thousands of years to come, guarding the peace of the Pacific Coast and
the quiet of the Capilano Canyon."

</p><p> * </p><p> * </p><p> * </p><p> * </p><p> *

</p><p>This is the Indian legend of "The Lions of Vancouver" as I had it
from one who will tell me no more the traditions of his people.</p>

<head>The Siwash Rock</head>

<p>UNIQUE and so distinct from its surroundings as to suggest rather the
handicraft of man than a whim of Nature, it looms up at the entrance to
the Narrows, a symmetrical column of solid grey stone.  There are no
similar formations within the range of vision, or indeed within many a
day's paddle up and down the coast.  Amongst all the wonders, the
natural beauties that encircle Vancouver, the marvels of mountains
shaped into crouching lions and brooding beavers, the yawning canyons,
the stupendous forest firs and cedars, Siwash Rock stands as distinct,
as individual, as if dropped from another sphere.

</p><p>I saw it first in the slanting light of a redly setting August
sun; the little tuft of green shrubbery that crests its summit was black
against the crimson of sea and sky, and its colossal base of grey stone
gleamed like flaming polished granite.

</p><p>My old tillicum lifted his paddle blade to point towards it.
"You know the story?" he asked.  I shook my head (experience had taught
me his love of silent replies, his moods of legend-telling).  For a time
we paddled slowly; the rock detached itself from its background of
forest and shore, and it stood forth like a sentinel &mdash; erect, enduring,
eternal.

</p><p>"Do you think it stands straight &mdash; like a man?" he asked.

</p><p>"Yes, like some noble-spirited, upright warrior," I replied.

</p><p>"It is a man," he said, "and a warrior man, too; a man who fought
for everything that was noble and upright."

</p><p>"What do you regard as everything that is noble and upright,
Chief?" I asked, curious as to his ideas.  I shall not forget the reply:
it was but two words &mdash; astounding, amazing words.  He said simply:

</p><p>"Clean fatherhood."

<pb n="8"/>

</p><p>Through my mind raced tumultuous recollections of numberless
articles in yet numberless magazines, all dealing with the recent "fad"
of motherhood, but I had to hear from the lips of a Squamish Indian
Chief the only treatise on the nobility of "clean fatherhood" that I
have yet unearthed.  And this treatise has been an Indian legend for
centuries; and lest they forget how all-important those two little words
must ever be, Siwash Rock stands to remind them, set there by the Deity
as a monument to one who kept his own life clean, that cleanliness might
be the heritage of the generations to come.

</p><p>It was "thousands of years ago" (all Indian legends begin in
extremely remote times) that a handsome boy chief journeyed in his canoe
to the upper coast for the shy little northern girl whom he brought home
as his wife.  Boy though he was, the young chief had proved himself to
be an excellent warrior, a fearless hunter, and an upright, courageous
man among men.  His tribe loved him, his enemies respected him, and the
base and mean and cowardly feared him.

</p><p>The customs and traditions of his ancestors were a positive
religion to him, the sayings and the advices of the old people were his
creed.  He was conservative in every rite and ritual of his race.  He
fought his tribal enemies like the savage that he was.  He sang his war
songs, danced his war dances, slew his foes, but the little girl-wife
from the north he treated with the deference that he gave his own
mother, for was she not to be the mother of his warrior son?

</p><p>The year rolled round, weeks merged into months, winter into
spring, and one glorious summer at daybreak he wakened to her voice
calling him.  She stood beside him, smiling.

</p><p>"It will be to-day," she said proudly.

</p><p>He sprang from his couch of wolf skins and looked out upon the
coming day: the promise of what it would bring him seemed breathing
through all his forest world.  He took her very gently by the hand and
led her through the tangle of wilderness down to the water's edge, where
the beauty spot we moderns call

<pb n="9"/>

Stanley Park bends about Prospect Point.  "I must swim," he told her.

</p><p>"I must swim, too," she smiled with the perfect understanding of
two beings who are mated.  For to them the old Indian custom was law
-the custom that the parents of a coming child must swim until their
flesh is so clear and clean that a wild animal cannot scent their
proximity.  If the wild creatures of the forests have no fear of them,
then, and only then, are they fit to become parents, and to scent a
human is in itself a fearsome thing to all wild things.

</p><p>So those two plunged into the waters of the Narrows as the grey
dawn slipped up the eastern skies and all the forest awoke to the life
of a new, glad day.  Presently he took her ashore, and smilingly she
crept away under the giant trees.  "I must be alone," she said, "but
some to me at sunrise: you will not find me alone then."  He smiled
also, and plunged back into the sea.  He must swim, swim, swim through
this hour when his fatherhood was coming upon him.  It was the law that
he must be clean, spotlessly clean, so that when his child looked out
upon the world it would have the chance to live its own life clean.  If
he did not swim hour upon hour his child would come to an unclean
father.  He must give his child a chance in life; he must not hamper it
by his own uncleanliness at its birth.  It was the tribal law &mdash; the law
of vicarious purity.

</p><p>As he swam joyously to and fro, a canoe bearing four men headed
up the Narrows.  These men were giants in stature, and the stroke of
their paddles made huge eddies that boiled like the seething tides.

</p><p>"Out from our course!" they cried as his lithe, copper-colored
body arose and fell with his splendid stroke.  He laughed at them,
giants though they were, and answered that he could not cease his
swimming at their demand.

</p><p>"But you shall cease!" they commanded.  "We are the men (agents)
of the Sagalie Tyee (God), and we command you ashore out of our way!"
(I find in all these Coast Indian

<pb n="10"/>

legends that the Deity is represented by four men, usually paddling an
immense canoe.)

</p><p>He ceased swimming, and, lifting his head, defied them.  "I shall
not stop, nor yet go ashore," he declared, striking out once more to the
middle of the channel.

</p><p>"Do you dare disobey us," they cried &mdash; "we, the men of the
Sagalie Tyee?  We can turn you into a fish, or a tree, or a stone for
this; do you dare disobey the Great Tyee?"

</p><p>"I dare anything for the cleanliness and purity of my coming
child.  I dare even the Sagalie Tyee Himself, but my child must be born
to a spotless life."

</p><p>The four men were astounded.  They consulted together, lighted
their pipes and sat in council.  Never had they, the men of the Sagalie
Tyee, been defied before.  Now, for the sake of a little unborn child,
they were ignored, disobeyed, almost despised.  The lithe young
copper-colored body still disported itself in the cool waters;
superstition held that should their canoe, or even their paddle blades,
touch a human being their marvellous power would be lost.  The handsome
young chief swam directly in their course.  They dared not run him down;
if so, they would become as other men.  While they yet counselled what
to do, there floated from out the forest a faint, strange, compelling
sound.  They listened, and the young chief ceased his stroke as he
listened also.  The faint sound drifted out across the waters once more.
It was the cry of a little, little child.  Then one of the four men, he
that steered the canoe, the strongest and tallest of them all, arose
and, standing erect, stretched out his arms towards the rising sun and
chanted, not a curse on the young chief's disobedience, but a promise of
everlasting days and freedom from death.

</p><p>"Because you have defied all things that came in your path we
promise this to you," he chanted; "you have defied what interferes with
your child's chance for a clean life, you have lived as you wish your
son to live, you have defied us when we would have stopped your swimming
and hampered your child's

<pb n="11"/>

future.  You have placed that child's future before all things, and for
this the Sagalie Tyee commands us to make you forever a pattern for your
tribe.  You shall never die, but you shall stand through all the
thousands of years to come, where all eyes can see you.  You shall live,
live, live as an indestructible monument to Clean Fatherhood."

</p><p>The four men lifted their paddles, and as the handsome young
chief swam inshore, as his feet touched the line where sea and land met,
he was transformed into stone.

</p><p>Then the four men said, "His wife and child must ever be near
him; they shall not die, but live also."  And they, too, were turned
into stone.  If you penetrate the hollows in the woods near Siwash Rock
you will find a large rock and a smaller one beside it.  They are the
shy little bride-wife from the north, with her hour-old baby beside her.
And from the uttermost parts of the world vessels come daily throbbing
and sailing up the Narrows.  From far trans-Pacific ports, from the
frozen North, from the lands of the Southern Cross, they pass and repass
the living rock that was there before their hulls were shaped, that will
be there when their very names are forgotten, when their crews and their
captains have taken their long last voyage, when their merchandise has
rotted, and their owners are known no more.  But the tall, grey column
of stone will still be there &mdash; a monument to one man's fidelity to a
generation yet unborn -and will endure from everlasting to everlasting.</p>

<head>The Recluse</head>

<p>JOURNEYING toward the upper course of the Capilano River, about a
mile citywards from the damn, you will pass a disused logger's shack.
Leave the trail at this point and strike through the undergrowth for a
few hundred yards and you will be on the rocky borders of that purest,
most restless river in all Canada.  The stream is haunted with
tradition, teeming with a score of romances that vie with its grandeur
and loveliness, and of which its waters are perpetually whispering.  But
I learned this legend from one whose voice was as dulcet as the swirling
rapids; but, unlike them, that voice is hushed today, while the river
still sings on &mdash; sings on.

</p><p>It was singing in very melodious tones through the long August
afternoon two summers ago, while we, the chief, his happyhearted wife
and bright, young daughter, all lounged amongst the boulders and watched
the lazy clouds drift from peak to peak far above us.  It was one of his
inspired days; legends crowded to his lips as a whistle teases the mouth
of a happy boy, his heart was brimming with tales of the bygones, his
eyes were dark with dreams and that strange mournfulness that always
haunted them when he spoke of long-ago romances.  There was not a tree,
a boulder, a dash of rapid upon which his glance fell that he had not
some ancient superstition to link with it.  Then abruptly, in the very
midst of his verbal reveries, he turned and asked me if I were
superstitious.  Of course I replied that I was.

</p><p>"Do you think some happenings will bring trouble later on &mdash; will
foretell evil?" he asked.

</p><p>I made some evasive answer, which, however, seemed to satisfy
him, for he plunged into the strange tale of the recluse of the canyon
with more vigor than dreaminess; but first he asked me the question:

<pb n="14"/>

</p><p>"What do your own tribes, those east of the great mountains think
of twin children?"

</p><p>I shook my head.

</p><p>"That is enough," he said before I could reply.  "I see, your
people do not like them."

</p><p>"Twin children are almost unknown with us," I hastened.  "They
are rare, very rare, but it is true we do not welcome them."

</p><p>"Why?" he asked abruptly.

</p><p>I was a little uncertain about telling him.  If I said the wrong
thing, the coming tale might die on his lips before it was born to
speech, but we understood each other so well that I finally ventured the
truth:

</p><p>"We Iroquois say that twin children are as rabbits," I explained.
"The nation always nicknames the parents.  'Tow-wan-da-na-ga.'  That is
the Mohawk for rabbit."

</p><p>"Is that all?" he asked curiously.

</p><p>"That is all.  Is it not enough to render twin children
unwelcome?" I questioned.

</p><p>He thought awhile, then with evident desire to learn how all
races regarded this occurrence, he said, "You have been much among the
Palefaces, what do they say of twins?"

</p><p>"Oh! the Palefaces like them.  They are &mdash; they are &mdash; oh! well,
they say they are very proud of having twins," I stammered.  Once again
I was hardly sure of my ground.  He looked most incredulous, and I was
led to enquire what his own people of the Squamish thought of this
discussed problem.

</p><p>"It is no pride to us," he said, decidedly; "nor yet is it
disgrace of rabbits, but it is a fearsome thing &mdash; a sign of coming evil
to the father, and, worse than that, of coming disaster to the tribe."

</p><p>Then I knew he held in his heart some strange incident that gave
substance to the superstition.  "Won't you tell it to me?" I begged.

</p><p>He leaned a little backward against a giant boulder, clasping his
thin, brown hands about his knees; his eyes roved up the galloping
river, then swept down the singing waters to where they crowded past the
sudden bend, and during the entire recital of the strange legend his
eyes never left that spot where

<pb n="15"/>

the stream disappeared in its hurrying journey to the sea.  Without
preamble he began:

</p><p>"It was a grey morning when they told him of this disaster that
had befallen him.  He was a great chief, and he ruled many tribes on the
North Pacific Coast; but what was his greatness now?  His young wife had
borne him twins, and was sobbing out her anguish in the little fir-bark
lodge near the tidewater.

</p><p>"Beyond the doorway gathered many old men and women &mdash; old in
years, old in wisdom, old in the lore and learning of their nations.
Some of them wept, some chanted solemnly the dirge of their lost hopes
and happiness, which would never return because of this calamity; others
discussed in hushed voices this awesome thing, and for hours their grave
council was broken only by the infant cries of the two boy-babies in the
bark lodge, the hopeless sobs of the young mother, the agonized moans of
the stricken chief &mdash; their father.

</p><p>"'Something dire will happen to the tribe,' said the old men in
council.

</p><p>"'Something dire will happen to him, my husband,' wept the young
mother.

</p><p>"'Something dire will happen to us all,' echoed the unhappy
father.

</p><p>"Then an ancient medicine man arose, lifting his arms,
outstretching his palms to hush the lamenting throng.  His voice shook
with the weight of many winters, but his eyes were yet keen and mirrored
the clear thought and brain behind them, as the still trout pools in the
Capilano mirror the mountain tops.  His words were masterful, his
gestures commanding, his shoulders erect and kindly.  His was a
personality and an inspiration that no one dared dispute, and his
judgment was accepted as the words fell slowly, like a doom.

</p><p>"'It is the olden law of the Squamish that lest evil befall the
tribe the sire of twin children must go afar and alone into the mountain
fastnesses, there by his isolation and his loneliness to prove himself
stronger than the threatened evil, and thus to beat back the shadow that
would otherwise follow him and all his people.  I, therefore, name for
him the

<pb n="16"/>

length of days that he must spend alone fighting his invisible enemy.
He will know by some great sign in Nature the hour that the evil is
conquered, the hour that his race is saved.  He must leave before this
sun sets, taking with him only his strongest bow, his fleetest arrows,
and going up into the mountain wilderness remain there ten days &mdash;
alone, alone.'

</p><p>"The masterful voice ceased, the tribe wailed their assent, the
father arose speechless, his drawn face revealing great agony over this
seemingly brief banishment.  He took leave of his sobbing wife, of the
two tiny souls that were his sons, grasped his favorite bow and arrows,
and faced the forest like a warrior.  But at the end of the ten days he
did not return, nor yet ten weeks, nor yet ten months.

</p><p>"'He is dead,' wept the mother into the baby ears of her two
boys.  'He could not battle against the evil that threatened; it was
stronger than he &mdash; he so strong, so proud, so brave.'

</p><p>"'He is dead,' echoed the tribesmen and the tribeswomen.  'Our
strong, brave chief, he is dead.'  So they mourned the long year
through, but their chants and their tears but renewed their grief; he
did not return to them.

</p><p>"Meanwhile, far up the Capilano the banished chief had built his
solitary home; for who can tell what fatal trick of sound, what current
of air, what faltering note in the voice of the Medicine Man had
deceived his alert Indian ears?  But some unhappy fate had led him to
understand that his solitude must be of ten years' duration, not ten
days, and he had accepted the mandate with the heroism of a stoic.  For
if he had refused to do so his belief was that although the threatened
disaster would be spared him, the evil would fall upon his tribe.  This
was one more added to the long list of self-forgetting souls whose creed
has been, 'It is fitting that one should suffer for the people.'  It was
the world-old heroism of vicarious sacrifice.

</p><p>"With his hunting-knife the banished

<pb n="17"/>

Squamish chief stripped the bark from the firs and cedars, building for
himself a lodge beside the Capilano River, where leaping trout and
salmon could be speared by arrow-heads fastened to deftly shaped, long
handles.  All through the salmon run he smoked and dried the fish with
the care of a housewife.  The mountain sheep and goats, and even huge
black and cinnamon bears, fell before his unerring arrows; the
fleet-footed deer never returned to their haunts from their evening
drinking at the edge of the stream &mdash; their wild hearts, their agile
bodies were stilled when he took aim.  Smoked hams and saddles hung in
rows from the cross poles of his bark lodge, and the magnificent pelts
of animals carpeted his floors, padded his couch and clothed his body.
He tanned the soft doe hides, making leggings, moccasins and shirts,
stitching them together with deer sinew as he had seen his mother do in
the long-ago.  He gathered the juicy salmonberries, their acid flavor
being a gratifying change from meat and fish.  Month by month and year
by year he sat beside his lonely camp-fire, waiting for his long term of
solitude to end.  One comfort alone was his -he was enduring the
disaster, fighting the evil, that his tribe might go unscathed, that his
people be saved from calamity.  Slowly, laboriously the tenth year
dawned; day by day it dragged its long weeks across his waiting heart,
for Nature had not yet given the sign that his long probation was over.

</p><p>"Then one hot summer day the Thunder Bird came crashing through
the mountains about him.  Up from the arms of the Pacific rolled the
storm cloud, and the Thunder Bird, with its eyes of flashing light, beat
its huge vibrating wings on crag and canyon.

</p><p>"Upstream, a tall shaft of granite rears its needle-like length.
It is named 'Thunder Rock,' and wise men of the Paleface people say it
is rich in ore &mdash; copper, silver and gold.  At the base of this shaft
the Squamish chief crouched when the storm cloud broke and bellowed
through the ranges, and on its summit the Thunder Bird perched, its
gigantic

<pb n="18"/>

wings threshing the air into booming sounds, into splitting terrors,
like the crash of a giant cedar hurtling down the mountain side.

</p><p>"But when the beating of those black pinions ceased and the echo
of their thunder waves died down the depths of the canyon, the Squamish
chief arose as a new man.  The shadow on his soul had lifted, the fears
of evil were cowed and conquered.  In his brain, his blood, his veins,
his sinews, he felt that the poison of melancholy dwelt no more.  He had
redeemed his fault of fathering twin children; he had fulfilled the
demands of the law of his tribe.

</p><p>"As he heard the last beat of the Thunder Bird's wings dying
slowly, slowly, faintly, faintly, among the crags, he knew that the
bird, too, was dying, for its soul was leaving its monster black body,
and presently that soul appeared in the sky.  He could see it arching
overhead, before it took its long journey to the Happy Hunting Grounds,
for the soul of the Thunder Bird was a radiant half-circle of glorious
color spanning from peak to peak.  He lifted his head then, for he knew
it was the sign the ancient Medicine Man had told him to wait for &mdash; the
sign that his long banishment was ended.

</p><p>"And all these years, down in the tidewater country, the little
brown-faced twins were asking childwise, 'Where is our father?  Why have
we no father like other boys?'  To be met only with the oft-repeated
reply, 'Your father is no more.  Your father, the great chief, is dead.'

</p><p>"But some strange filial intuition told the boys that their sire
would some day return.  Often they voiced this feeling to their mother,
but she would only weep and say that not even the witchcraft of the
great Medicine Man could bring him to them.  But when they were ten
years old the two children came to their mother, hand within hand.  They
were armed with their little hunting-knives, their salmon spears, their
tiny bows and arrows.

</p><p>"'We go to find our father,' they said.

</p><p>"'Oh! useless quest,' wailed the mother.

<pb n="19"/>

</p><p>"'Oh! useless quest,' echoed the tribes-people.

</p><p>"But the great Medicine Man said, 'The heart of a child has
invisible eyes, perhaps the child-eyes see him.  The heart of a child
has invisible ears, perhaps the child-ears hear him call.  Let them go.'
So the little children went forth into the forest; their young feet flew
as though shod with wings, their young hearts pointed to the north as
does the white man's compass.  Day after day they journeyed up-stream,
until rounding a sudden bend they beheld a bark lodge with a thin blue
curl of smoke drifting from its roof.

</p><p>"'It is our father's lodge,' they told each other, for their
childish hearts were unerring in response to the call of kinship.
Hand-inhand they approached, and entering the lodge, said the one word,
'Come.'

</p><p>"The great Squamish chief outstretched his arms towards them,
then towards the laughing river, then towards the mountains.

</p><p>"'Welcome, my sons!' he said.  'And goodbye, my mountains, my
brothers, my crags and my canyons!'  And with a child clinging to each
hand he faced once more the country of the tidewater."

</p><p> * * * * *

</p><p>The legend was ended.

</p><p>For a long time he sat in silence.  He had removed his gaze from
the bend in the river, around which the two children had come and where
the eyes of the recluse had first rested on them after ten years of
solitude.

</p><p>The chief spoke again, "It was here, on this spot we are sitting,
that he built his lodge:  here he dwelt those ten years alone, alone."

</p><p>I nodded silently.  The legend was too beautiful to mar with
comments, and as the twilight fell, we threaded our way through the
underbrush, past the disused logger's camp and into the trail that leads
citywards.</p>

<head>The Lost Salmon Run</head>

<p>GREAT had been the "run," and the sockeye season was almost over.
For that reason I wondered many times why my old friend, the klootchman,
had failed to make one of the fishing fleet.  She was an indefatigable
workwoman, rivalling her husband as an expert catcher, and all the year
through she talked of little else but the coming run.  But this especial
season she had not appeared amongst her fellow-kind.  The fleet and the
canneries knew nothing of her, and when I enquired of her tribes-people
they would reply without explanation, "She not here this year."

</p><p>But one russet September afternoon I found her.  I had idled down
the trail from the swans' basin in Stanley Park to the rim that skirts
the Narrows, and I saw her graceful, high-bowed canoe heading for the
beach that is the favorite landing place of the "tillicums" from the
Mission.  Her canoe looked like a dream-craft, for the water was very
still and everywhere a blue film hung like a fragrant veil, for the peat
on Lulu Island had been smoldering for days and its pungent odors and
blue-grey haze made a dream-world of sea and shore and sky.

</p><p>I hurried upshore, hailing her in the Chinook, and as she caught
my voice she lifted her paddle directly above her head in the Indian
signal of greeting.

</p><p>As she beached, I greeted her with extended eager hands to assist
her ashore, for the klootchman is getting to be an old woman; albeit she
paddles against tidewater like a boy in his teens.

</p><p>"No," she said, as I begged her to come ashore.  "I not wait -me.  I just come to fetch Maarda; she been city; she come soon &mdash; now."
But she left her "working" attitude and curled like a schoolgirl in the
bow of the

<pb n="22"/>

canoe, her elbows resting on her paddle which she had flung across the
gunwales.

</p><p>"I have missed you, klootchman; you have not been to see me for
three moons, and you have not fished or been at the canneries," I
remarked.

</p><p>"No," she said.  "I stay home this year."  Then leaning towards
me with grave import in her manner, her eyes, her voice, she added, "I
have a grandchild, born first week July, so &mdash; I stay."

</p><p>So this explained her absence.  I, of course, offered
congratulations and enquired all about the great event, for this was her
first grandchild, and the little person was of importance.

</p><p>"And are you going to make a fisherman of him?" I asked.

</p><p>"No, no, not boy-child, it is girl-child," she answered with some
indescribable trick of expression that led me to know she preferred it
so.

</p><p>"You are pleased it is a girl?" I questioned in surprise.

</p><p>"Very pleased," she replied emphatically.  "Very good luck to
have girl for first grandchild.  Own tribe not like yours; we want girl
children first; we not always wish boychild born just for fight.  Your
people, they care only for war-path; our tribe more peaceful.  Very good
sign first grandchild to be girl.  I tell you why: girl-child maybe some
time mother herself; very grand thing to be mother."

</p><p>I felt I had caught the secret of her meaning.  She was rejoicing
that this little one should some time become one of the mothers of her
race.  We chatted over it a little longer and she gave me several
playful "digs" about my own tribe thinking so much less of motherhood
than hers, and so much more of battle and bloodshed.  Then we drifted
into talk of the sockeye run and of the hyiu chickimin the Indians would
get.

</p><p>"Yes, hyiu chickimin," she repeated with a sigh of satisfaction.
"Always; and hyiu muck-a-muck when big salmon run.  No more ever come
that bad year when not any fish."

</p><p>"When was that?" I asked.

<pb n="23"/>

</p><p>"Before you born, or I, or" &mdash; pointing across the park to the
distant city of Vancouver, that breathed its wealth and beauty across
the September afternoon &mdash; "before that place born, before white man
came here -oh! long before."

</p><p>Dear old klootchman!  I knew by the dusk in her eyes that she was
back in her Land of Legends, and that soon I would be the richer in my
hoard of Indian lore.  She sat, still leaning on her paddle; her eyes,
half-closed, rested on the distant outline of the blurred heights across
the Inlet.  I shall not further attempt her broken English, for this is
but the shadow of her story, and without her unique personality the
legend is as a flower that lacks both color and fragrance.  She called
it "The Lost Salmon Run."

</p><p>"The wife of the Great Tyee was but a wisp of a girl, but all the
world was young in those days; even the Fraser River was young and
small, not the mighty water it is now; but the pink salmon crowded its
throat just as they do now, and the tillicums caught and salted and
smoked the fish just as they have done this year, just as they will
always do.  But it was yet winter, and the rains were slanting and the
fogs drifting, when the wife of the Great Tyee stood before him and
said:

</p><p>"'Before the salmon run I shall give to you a great gift.  Will
you honor me most if it is the gift of a boy-child or a girl-child?'
The Great Tyee loved the woman.  He was stern with his people, hard with
his tribe; he ruled his council fires with a will of stone.  His
medicine men said he had no human heart in his body; his warriors said
he had no human blood in his veins.  But he clasped this woman's hands,
and his eyes, his lips, his voice, were gentle as her own, as he
replied:

</p><p>"'Give to me a girl-child &mdash; a little girlchild &mdash; that she may
grow to be like you, and, in her turn, give to her husband children.'

</p><p>"But when the tribes-people heard of his choice they arose in
great anger.  They surrounded him in a deep indignant circle.  'You are
a slave to the woman,' they declared, 'and now you desire to make
yourself a slave to a

<pb n="24"/>

woman-baby.  We want an heir &mdash; a man-child to be our Great Tyee in
years to come.  When you are old and weary of tribal affairs, when you
sit wrapped in your blanket in the hot summer sunshine, because your
blood is old and thin, what can a girl-child do to help either you or
us?  Who, then, will be our Great Tyee?'

</p><p>"He stood in the centre of the menacing circle, his arm folded,
his chin raised, his eyes hard as flint.  His voice, cold as stone,
replied:

</p><p>"'Perhaps she will give you such a manchild, and, if so, the
child is yours; he will belong to you, not to me; he will become the
possession of the people.  But if the child is a girl she will belong to
me &mdash; she will be mine.  You cannot take her from me as you took me from
my mother's side and forced me to forget my aged father in my service to
my tribe; she will belong to me, will be the mother of my grandchildren,
and her husband will be my son.'

</p><p>"'You do not care for the good of your tribe.  You care only for
your own wishes and desires,' they rebelled.  'Suppose the salmon run is
small, we will have no food; suppose there is no man-child, we will have
no Great Tyee to show us how to get food from other tribes, and we shall
starve.'

</p><p>"'Your hearts are black and bloodless,' thundered the Great Tyee,
turning upon them fiercely, 'and your eyes are blinded.  Do you wish the
tribe to forget how great is the importance of a child that will some
day be a mother herself, and give to your children and grandchildren a
Great Tyee?  Are the people to live, to thrive, to increase, to become
more powerful with no mother-women to bear future sons and daughters?
Your minds are dead, your brains are chilled.  Still, even in your
ignorance, you are my people: you and your wishes must be considered.  I
call together the great medicine men, the men of witchcraft, the men of
magic.  They shall decide the laws which will follow the bearing of
either boy or girl-child.  What say you, oh!  mighty men?'

</p><p>"Messengers were then sent up and down

<pb n="25"/>

the coast, sent far up the Fraser River, and to the valley lands inland
for many leagues, gathering as they journeyed all the men of magic that
could be found.  Never were so many medicine men in council before.
They built fires and danced and chanted for many days.  They spoke with
the gods of the mountains, with the gods of the sea, then 'the power' of
decision came to them.  They were inspired with a choice to lay before
the tribespeople, and the most ancient medicine man in all the coast
region arose and spoke their resolution:

</p><p>"'The people of the tribe cannot be allowed to have all things.
They want a boy-child and they want a great salmon run also.  They
cannot have both.  The Sagalie Tyee has revealed to us, the great men of
magic, that both these things will make the people arrogant and selfish.
They must choose between the two.'

</p><p>"'Choose, oh! you ignorant tribes-people,' commanded the Great
Tyee.  'The wise men of our coast have said that the girl-child who will
some day bear children of her own will also bring abundance of salmon at
her birth; but the boy-child brings to you but himself.'

</p><p>"'Let the salmon go,'" shouted the people, 'but give us a future
Great Tyee.  Give us the boy-child.'

</p><p>"And when the child was born it was a boy.

</p><p>"'Evil will fall upon you,' wailed the Great Tyee.  'You have
despised a mother-woman.  You will suffer evil and starvation and hunger
and poverty, oh! foolish tribes-people.  Did you not know how great a
girl-child is?'

</p><p>"That spring, people from a score of tribes came up to the Fraser
for the salmon run.  They came great distances &mdash; from the mountains,
the lakes, the far-off dry lands, but not one fish entered the vast
rivers of the Pacific Coast.  The people had made their choice.  They
had forgotten the honor that a motherchild would have brought them.
They were bereft of their food.  They were stricken with poverty.
Through the long winter that followed they endured hunger and
starvation.  Since then our tribe has always

<pb n="26"/>

welcomed girl-children &mdash; we want no more lost runs."

</p><p>The klootchman lifted her arms from her paddle as she concluded;
her eyes left the irregular outline of the violet mountains.  She had
come back to this year of grace &mdash; her Legend Land had vanished.

</p><p>"So," she added, "you see now, maybe, why I glad my grandchild is
girl; it means big salmon run next year."

</p><p>"It is a beautiful story, klootchman," I said, "and I feel a
cruel delight that your men of magic punished the people for their
illchoice."

</p><p>"That because you girl-child yourself," she laughed.

</p><p>There was the slightest whisper of a step behind me.  I turned to
find Maarda almost at my elbow.  The rising tide was unbeaching the
canoe, and as Maarda stepped in and the klootchman slipped astern it
drifted afloat.

</p><p>"Kla-how-ya," nodded the klootchman as she dipped her
paddle-blade in exquisite silence.

</p><p>"Kla-how-ya," smiled Maarda.

</p><p>"Kla-how-ya, tillicums," I replied, and watched for many moments
as they slipped away into the blurred distance, until the canoe merged
into the violet and grey of the farther shore.</p>

<head>The Deep Waters</head>

<p>FAR over your left shoulder as your boat leaves the Narrows to thread
the beautiful waterways that lead to Vancouver Island, you will see the
summit of Mount Baker robed in its everlasting whiteness and always
reflecting some wonderful glory from the rising sun, the golden
noontide, or the violet and amber sunset.  This is the Mount Ararat of
the Pacific Coast peoples; for those readers who are familiar with the
ways and beliefs and faiths of primitive races will agree that it is
difficult to discover anywhere in the world a race that has not some
story of the Deluge, which they have chronicled and localized to fit the
understanding and the conditions of the nation that composes their own
immediate world.

</p><p>Amongst the red nations of America I doubt if any two tribes have
the same ideas regarding the Flood.  Some of the traditions concerning
this vast whim of Nature are grotesque in the extreme; some are
impressive; some even profound; but of all the stories of the Deluge
that I have been able to collect I know of not a single one that can
even begin to equal in beauty of conception, let alone rival in possible
reality and truth, the Squamish legend of "The Deep Waters."

</p><p>I here quote the legend of "mine own people," the Iroquois tribes
of Ontario, regarding the Deluge.  I do this to paint the color of
contrast in richer shades, for I am bound to submit that we who pride
ourselves on ancient intellectuality have but a childish tale of the
Flood when compared with the jealously preserved annals of the Squamish,
which savour more of history than tradition.  With "mine own people,"
animals always play a much more important part and are endowed with a
finer intelligence than humans.  I do not find amid my notes a single
tradition of the Iroquois wherein animals do not figure,

<pb n="28"/>

and our story of the Deluge rests entirely with the intelligence of
sea-going and river-going creatures.  With us, animals in olden times
were greater than man; but it is not so with the Coast Indians, except
in rare instances.

</p><p>When a Coast Indian consents to tell you a legend he will,
without variation, begin it with, "It was before the white people came."

</p><p>The natural thing for you then to ask is, "But who were here
then?"

</p><p>He will reply, "Indians, and just the trees, and animals, and
fishes, and a few birds."

</p><p>So you are prepared to accept the animal world as intelligent
co-habitants of the Pacific slope, but he will not lead you to think he
regards them as equals, much less superiors.  But to revert to "mine own
people": they hold the intelligence of wild animals far above that of
man, for perhaps the one reason that when an animal is sick it effects
its own cure; it knows what grasses and herbs to eat, what to avoid,
while the sick human calls the medicine man, whose wisdom is not only
the result of years of study, but also heredity; consequently any great
natural event, such as the Deluge, has much to do with the wisdom of the
creatures of the forests and the rivers.

</p><p>Iroquois tradition tells us that once this earth was entirely
submerged in water, and during this period for many days a busy little
muskrat swam about vainly looking for a foothold of earth wherein to
build his house.  In his search he encountered a turtle leisurely
swimming about, so they had speech together, and the muskrat complained
of weariness; he could find no foothold; he was tired of incessant
swimming, and longed for land such as his ancestors enjoyed.  The turtle
suggested that the muskrat should dive and endeavor to find earth at the
bottom of the sea.  Acting on this advice the muskrat plunged down, then
arose with his two little forepaws grasping some earth he had found
beneath the waters.

</p><p>"Place it on my shell and dive again for more," directed the
turtle.  The muskrat did so, but when he returned with his paws filled
with earth he discovered the small quantity he had first deposited on
the turtle's shell had

<pb n="29"/>

doubled in size.  The return from the third trip found the turtle's load
again doubled.  So the building went on at double compound increase, and
the world grew its continents and its island with great rapidity, and
now rests on the shell of a turtle.

</p><p>If you ask an Iroquois, "And did no men survive this flood?" he
will reply, "Why should men survive?  The animals are wiser than men;
let the wisest live."

</p><p>How, then, was the earth re-peopled?

</p><p>The Iroquois will tell you that the otter was a medicine man;
that in swimming and diving about he found corpses of men and women; he
sang his medicine songs and they came to life, and the otter brought
them fish for food until they were strong enough to provide for
themselves.  Then the Iroquois will conclude his tale with, "You know
well that the otter has greater wisdom than a man."

</p><p>So much for "mine own people" and our profound respect for the
superior intelligence of our little brothers of the animal world.

</p><p>But the Squamish tribe hold other ideas.  It was on a February
day that I first listened to this beautiful, humane story of the Deluge.
My royal old tillicum had come to see me through the rains and mists of
late winter days.  The gateways of my wigwam always stood open &mdash; very
widely open &mdash; for his feet to enter, and this especial day he came with
the worst downpour of the season.

</p><p>Womanlike, I protested with a thousand contradictions in my voice
that he should venture out to see me on such a day.  It was "Oh!  Chief,
I am so glad to see you!" and it was "Oh! Chief, why didn't you stay at
home on such a wet day &mdash; your poor throat will suffer."  But I soon had
quantities of hot tea for him, and the huge cup my own father always
used was his &mdash; as long as the Sagalie Tyee allowed his dear feet to
wander my way.  The immense cup stands idle and empty now for the second
time.

</p><p>Helping him off with his great-coat, I chatted on about the
deluge of rain, and he

<pb n="30"/>

remarked it was not so very bad, as one could yet walk.

</p><p>"Fortunately, yes, for I cannot swim," I told him.

</p><p>He laughed, replying, "Well, it is not so bad as when the Great
Deep Waters covered the world."

</p><p>Immediately I foresaw the coming legend, so crept into the shell
of monosyllables.

</p><p>"No?" I questioned.

</p><p>"No," he replied.  "For one time there was no land here at all;
everywhere there was just water."

</p><p>"I can quite believe it," I remarked caustically.

</p><p>He laughed &mdash; that irresistible, though silent, David Warfield
laugh of his that always brought a responsive smile from his listeners.
Then he plunged directly into the tradition, with no preface save a
comprehensive sweep of his wonderful hands towards my wide window,
against which the rains were beating.

</p><p>"It was after a long, long time of this &mdash; this rain.  The
mountain streams were swollen, the rivers choked, the sea began to rise
&mdash; and yet it rained; for weeks and weeks it rained."  He ceased
speaking, while the shadows of centuries gone crept into his eyes.
Tales of the misty past always inspired him.

</p><p>"Yes," he continued.  "It rained for weeks and weeks, while the
mountain torrents roared thunderingly down, and the sea crept silently
up.  The level lands were first to float in sea water, then to
disappear.  The slopes were next to slip into the sea.  The world was
slowly being flooded.  Hurriedly the Indian tribes gathered in one spot,
a place of safety far above the reach of the on-creeping sea.  The spot
was the circling shore of Lake Beautiful, up the North Arm.  They held a
Great Council and decided at once upon a plan of action.  A giant canoe
should be built, and some means contrived to anchor it in case the
waters mounted to the heights.  The men undertook the canoe, the women
the anchorage.

</p><p>"A giant tree was felled, and day and night the men toiled over
its construction into the most stupendous canoe the world has ever

<pb n="31"/>

known.  Not an hour, not a moment, but many worked, while the
toil-wearied ones slept, only to awake to renewed toil.  Meanwhile the
women also worked at a cable &mdash; the largest, the longest, the strongest
that Indian hands and teeth had ever made.  Scores of them gathered and
prepared the cedar fibre; scores of them plaited, rolled and seasoned
it; scores of them chewed upon it inch by inch to make it pliable;
scores of them oiled and worked, oiled and worked, oiled and worked it
into a sea-resisting fabric.  And still the sea crept up, and up, and
up.  It was the last day; hope of life for the tribe, of land for the
world, was doomed.  Strong hands, selfsacrificing hands fastened the
cable the women had made &mdash; one end to the giant canoe, the other about
an enormous boulder, a vast immovable rock as firm as the foundations of
the world &mdash; for might not the canoe with its priceless freight drift
out, far out, to sea, and when the water subsided might not this ship of
safety be leagues and leagues beyond the sight of land on the
storm-driven Pacific?

</p><p>"Then with the bravest hearts that ever beat, noble hands lifted
every child of the tribe into this vast canoe; not one single baby was
overlooked.  The canoe was stocked with food and fresh water, and
lastly, the ancient men and women of the race selected as guardians to
these children the bravest, most stalwart, handsomest young man of the
tribe, and the mother of the youngest baby in the camp &mdash; she was but a
girl of sixteen, her child but two weeks old; but she, too, was brave
and very beautiful.  These two were placed, she at the bow of the canoe
to watch, he at the stern to guide, and all the little children crowded
between.

</p><p>"And still the sea crept up, and up, and up.  At the crest of the
bluffs about Lake Beautiful the doomed tribes crowded.  Not a single
person attempted to enter the canoe.  There was no wailing, no crying
out for safety.  'Let the little children, the young mother, and the
bravest and best of our young men live,' was all the farewell those in
the canoe heard as the waters reached the summit,

<pb n="32"/>

and &mdash; the canoe floated.  Last of all to be seen was the top of the
tallest tree, then &mdash; all was a world of water.

</p><p>"For days and days there was no land &mdash; just the rush of
swirling, snarling sea; but the canoe rode safely at anchor, the cable
those scores of dead, faithful women had made held true as the hearts
that beat behind the toil and labor of it all.

</p><p>"But one morning at sunrise, far to the south a speck floated on
the breast of the waters; at midday it was larger; at evening it was yet
larger.  The moon arose, and in its magic light the man at the stern saw
it was a patch of land.  All night he watched it grow, and at daybreak
looked with glad eyes upon the summit of Mount Baker.  He cut the cable,
grasped his paddle in his strong, young hands, and steered for the
south.  When they landed, the waters were sunken half down the mountain
side.  The children were lifted out; the beautiful young mother, the
stalwart young brave, turned to each other, clasped hands, looked into
each other's eyes &mdash; and smiled.

</p><p>"And down in the vast country that lies between Mount Baker and
the Fraser River they made a new camp, built new lodges, where the
little children grew and thrived, and lived and loved, and the earth was
repeopled by them.

</p><p>"The Squamish say that in a gigantic crevice half way to the
crest of Mount Baker may yet be seen the outlines of an enormous canoe,
but I have never seen it myself."

</p><p>He ceased speaking with that far-off cadence in his voice with
which he always ended a legend, and for a long time we both sat in
silence listening to the rains that were still beating against the
window.</p>

<head>The Sea-Serpent</head>

<p>THERE is one vice that is absolutely unknown to the red man; he was
born without it, and amongst all the deplorable things he has learned
from the white races, this, at least, he has never acquired.  That is
the vice of avarice.  That the Indian looks upon greed of gain,
miserliness, avariciousness and wealth accumulated above the head of his
poorer neighbor as one of the lowest degradations he can fall to is
perhaps more aptly illustrated in this legend than anything I could
quote to demonstrate his horror of what he calls "the white man's
unkindness."  In a very wide and varied experience with many tribes, I
have yet to find even one instance of avarice, and I have encountered
but one single case of a "stingy Indian," and this man was so marked
amongst his fellows that at mention of his name his tribes-people jeered
and would remark contemptuously that he was like a white man &mdash; hated to
share his money and his possessions.  All red races are born Socialists,
and most tribes carry out their communistic ideas to the letter.
Amongst the Iroquois it is considered disgraceful to have food if your
neighbor has none.  To be a creditable member of the nation you must
divide your possessions with your less fortunate fellows.  I find it
much the same amongst the Coast Indians, though they are less bitter in
their hatred of the extremes of wealth and poverty than are the Eastern
tribes.  Still, the very fact that they have preserved this legend, in
which they liken avarice to a slimy sea-serpent, shows the trend of
their ideas; shows, too, that an Indian is an Indian, no matter what his
tribe; shows that he cannot or will not hoard money; shows that his
native morals demand that the spirit of greed must be strangled at all
cost.

<pb n="34"/>

</p><p>The Chief and I had sat long over our luncheon.  He had been
talking of his trip to England and of the many curious things he had
seen.  At last, in an outburst of enthusiasm, he said: "I saw everything
in the world &mdash; everything but a sea-serpent!"

</p><p>"But there is no such thing as a sea-serpent," I laughed, "so you
must have really seen everything in the world."

</p><p>His face clouded; for a moment he sat in silence; then looking
directly at me said, "Maybe none now, but long ago there was one here -in the Inlet."

</p><p>"How long ago?" I asked.

</p><p>"When first the white gold-hunters came," he replied.  "Came with
greedy, clutching fingers, greedy eyes, greedy hearts.  The white men
fought, murdered, starved, went mad with love of that gold far up the
Fraser River.  Tillicums were tillicums no more, brothers were foes,
fathers and sons were enemies.  Their love of the gold was a curse."

</p><p>"Was it then the sea-serpent was seen?" I asked, perplexed with
the problem of trying to connect the gold-seekers with such a monster.

</p><p>"Yes, it was then, but &mdash;" he hesitated, then plunged into the
assertion, "but you will not believe the story if you think there is no
such thing as a sea-serpent."

</p><p>"I shall believe whatever you tell me, Chief," I answered; "I am
only too ready to believe.  You know I come of a superstitious race, and
all my association with the Palefaces has never yet robbed me of my
birthright to believe strange traditions."

</p><p>"You always understand," he said after a pause.

</p><p>"It's my heart that understands," I remarked quietly.

</p><p>He glanced up quickly, and with one of his all too few radiant
smiles, he laughed.

</p><p>"Yes, skookum tum-tum."  Then without further hesitation he told
the tradition, which, although not of ancient happening, is held in
great reverence by his tribe.  During its recital he sat with folded
arms, leaning on the table, his head and shoulders bending eagerly

<pb n="35"/>

towards me as I sat at the opposite side.  It was the only time he ever
talked to me when he did not use emphasising gesticulations, but his
hands never once lifted: his wonderful eyes alone gave expression to
what he called "The Legend of the 'Salt-chuck Oluk'" (sea-serpent).

</p><p>"Yes, it was during the first gold craze, and many of our young
men went as guides to the whites far up the Fraser.  When they returned
they brought these tales of greed and murder back with them, and our old
people and our women shook their heads and said evil would come of it.
But all our young men, except one, returned as they went &mdash; kind to the
poor, kind to those who were foodless, sharing whatever they had with
their tillicums.  But one, by name Shak-shak (The Hawk), came back with
hoards of gold nuggets, chickimin (Money), everything; he was rich like
the white men, and, like them, he kept it.  He would count his
chickimin, count his nuggets, gloat over them, toss them in his palms.
He loved them better than food, better than his tillicums, better than
his life.  The entire tribe arose.  They said Shak-shak had the disease
of greed; that to cure it he must give a great potlatch, divide his
riches with the poorer ones, share them with the old, the sick, the
foodless.  But he jeered and laughed and told them No, and went on
loving and gloating over his gold.

</p><p>"Then the Sagalie Tyee spoke out of the sky and said, 'Shak-shak,
you have made of yourself a loathsome thing; you will not listen to the
cry of the hungry, to the call of the old and sick; you will not share
your possessions; you have made of yourself an outcast from your tribe
and disobeyed the ancient laws of your people.  Now I will make of you a
thing loathed and hated by all men, both white and red.  You will have
two heads, for your greed has two mouths to bite.  One bites the poor,
and one bites your own evil heart &mdash; and the fangs in these mouths are
poison, poison that


<pb n="36"/>

kills the hungry, and poison that kills your own manhood.  Your evil
heart will beat in the very centre of your foul body, and he that
pierces it will kill the disease of greed forever from amongst his
people.'  And when the sun arose above the North Arm the next morning
the tribes-people saw a gigantic sea-serpent stretched across the
surface of the waters.  One hideous head rested on the bluffs at
Brockton Point, the other rested on a group of rocks just below Mission,
at the western edge of North Vancouver.  If you care to go there some
day I will show you the hollow in one great stone where that head lay.
The tribespeople were stunned with horror.  They loathed the creature,
they hated it, they feared it.  Day after day it lay there, its
monstrous heads lifted out of the waters, its mile-long body blocking
all entrance from the Narrows, all outlet from the North Arm.  The
chiefs made council, the medicine men danced and chanted, but the
salt-chuck oluk never moved.  It could not move, for it was the hated
totem of what now rules the white man's world -greed and love of
chickimin.  No one can ever move the love of chickimin from the white
man's heart, no one can ever make him divide all with the poor.  But
after the chiefs and medicine men had done all in their power, and still
the salt-chuck oluk lay across the waters, a handsome boy of sixteen
approached them and reminded them of the words of the Sagalie Tyee,
'that he that pierced the monster's heart would kill the disease of
greed forever amongst his people.'

</p><p>"'Let me try to find this evil heart, oh!  great men of my
tribe,' he cried.  'Let me war upon this creature; let me try to rid my
people of this pestilence.'

</p><p>"The boy was brave and very beautiful.  His tribes-people called
him the Tenas Tyee (Little Chief) and they loved him.  Of all his wealth
of fish and furs, of game and hykwa (large shell money) he gave to the
boys who had none; he hunted food for the old people; he tanned skins
and furs for those whose feet were feeble, whose eyes were fading, whose
blood ran thin with age.

<pb n="37"/>

</p><p>"'Let him go!' cried the tribes-people.  'This unclean monster
can only be overcome by cleanliness, this creature of greed can only be
overthrown by generosity.  Let him go!'  The chiefs and the medicine men
listened, then consented.  'Go,' they commanded, 'and fight this thing
with your strongest weapons -cleanliness and generosity.'

</p><p>"The Tenas Tyee turned to his mother.  'I shall be gone four
days,' he told her, 'and I shall swim all that time.  I have tried all
my life to be generous, but the people say I must be clean also to fight
this unclean thing.  While I am gone put fresh furs on my bed every day,
even if I am not here to lie on them; if I know my bed, my body and my
heart are all clean I can overcome this serpent.'

</p><p>"'Your bed shall have fresh furs every morning,' his mother said
simply.

</p><p>"The Tenas Tyee then stripped himself and, with no clothing save
a buckskin belt into which he thrust his hunting-knife, he flung his
lithe young body into the sea.  But at the end of four days he did not
return.  Sometimes his people could see him swimming far out in
mid-channel, endeavoring to find the exact centre of the serpent, where
lay its evil, selfish heart; but on the fifth morning they saw him rise
out of the sea, climb to the summit of Brockton Point and greet the
rising sun with outstretched arms.  Weeks and months went by, still the
Tenas Tyee would swim daily searching for that heart of greed; and each
morning the sunrise glinted on his slender young copper-colored body as
he stood with outstretched arms at the tip of Brockton Point, greeting
the coming day and then plunging from the summit into the sea.

</p><p>"And at his home on the north shore his mother dressed his bed
with fresh furs each morning.  The seasons drifted by, winter followed
summer, summer followed winter.  But it was four years before the Tenas
Tyee found the centre of the great salt-chuck oluk and plunged his
hunting-knife into its evil heart.  In its death-agony it writhed
through the Narrows, leaving a trail of blackness on the waters.  Its
huge body began to shrink, to

<pb n="38"/>

shrivel; it became dwarfed and withered, until nothing but the bones of
its back remained, and they, sea-bleached and lifeless, soon sank to the
bed of the ocean leagues off from the rim of land.  But as the Tenas
Tyee swam homeward and his clean, young body crossed through the black
stain left by the serpent, the waters became clear and blue and
sparkling.  He had overcome even the trail of the salt-chuck oluk.

</p><p>"When at last he stood in the doorway of his home he said, 'My
mother, I could not have killed the monster of greed amongst my people
had you not helped me by keeping one place for me at home fresh and
clean for my return.'

</p><p>"She looked at him as only mothers look.  'Each day these four
years, fresh furs have I laid for your bed.  Sleep now, and rest, oh! my
Tenas Tyee,' she said."

</p><p>* * * * * * *

</p><p>The Chief unfolded his arms, and his voice took another tone as
he said, "What do you call that story &mdash; a legend?"

</p><p>"The white people would call it an allegory," I answered.  He
shook his head.

</p><p>"No savvy," he smiled.

</p><p>I explained as simply as possible, and with his customary
alertness he immediately understood.  "That's right," he said.  "That's
what we say it means, we Squamish, that greed is evil and not clean,
like the salt-chuck oluk.  That it must be stamped out amongst our
people, killed by cleanliness and generosity.  The boy that overcame the
serpent was both these things."

</p><p>"What became of this splendid boy?" I asked.

</p><p>"The Tenas Tyee?  Oh! some of our old, old people say they
sometimes see him now, standing on Brockton Point, his bare young arms
outstretched to the rising sun," he replied.

</p><p>"Have you ever seen him, Chief?" I questioned.

</p><p>"No," he answered simply.  But I have never heard such poignant
regret as his wonderful voice crowded into that single word.</p>

<head>The Lost Island</head>

<p>YES," said my old tillicum, "we Indians have lost many things.  We
have lost our lands, our forests, our game, our fish; we have lost our
ancient religion, our ancient dress; some of the younger people have
even lost their fathers' language and the legends and traditions of
their ancestors.  We cannot call those old things back to us; they will
never come again.  We may travel many days up the mountain trails, and
look in the silent places for them.  They are not there.  We may paddle
many moons on the sea, but our canoes will never enter the channel that
leads to the yesterdays of the Indian people.  These things are lost,
just like 'The Island of the North Arm.'  They may be somewhere nearby,
but no one can ever find them."

</p><p>"But there are many islands up the North Arm," I asserted.

</p><p>"Not the island we Indian people have sought for many tens of
summers," he replied sorrowfully.

</p><p>"Was it ever there?" I questioned.

</p><p>"Yes, it was there," he said.  "My grandsires and my
great-grandsires saw it; but that was long ago.  My father never saw it,
though he spent many days in many years searching, always searching, for
it.  I am an old man myself, and I have never seen it, though from my
youth I, too, have searched.  Sometimes in the stillness of the nights I
have paddled up in my canoe."  Then, lowering his voice:  "Twice I have
seen its shadow: high rocky shores, reaching as high as the tree tops on
the mainland, then tall pines and firs on its summit like a king's
crown.  As I paddled up the Arm one summer night, long ago, the shadow
of these rocks and firs fell across my canoe, across my face, and across
the waters beyond.  I turned rapidly to look.  There was no island
there, nothing but a wide stretch of waters on both sides of me, and the
moon

<pb n="40"/>

almost directly overhead.  Don't say it was the shore that shadowed me,"
he hastened, catching my thought.  "The moon was above me; my canoe
scarce made a shadow on the still waters.  No, it was not the shore."

</p><p>"Why do you search for it?" I lamented, thinking of the old
dreams in my own life whose realization I have never attained.

</p><p>"There is something on that island that I want.  I shall look for
it until I die, for it is there," he affirmed.

</p><p>There was a long silence between us after that.  I had learned to
love silences when with my old tillicum, for they always led to a
legend.  After a time he began voluntarily:

</p><p>"It was more than one hundred years ago.  This great city of
Vancouver was but the dream of the Sagalie Tyee (God) at that time.  The
dream had not yet come to the white man; only one great Indian medicine
man knew that some day a great camp for Palefaces would lie between
False Creek and the Inlet.  This dream haunted him; it came to him night
and day &mdash; when he was amid his people laughing and feasting, or when he
was alone in the forest chanting his strange songs, beating his hollow
drum, or shaking his wooden witch-rattle to gain more power to cure the
sick and the dying of his tribe.  For years this dream followed him.  He
grew to be an old, old man, yet always he could hear voices, strong and
loud, as when they first spoke to him in his youth, and they would say:
'Between the two narrow strips of salt water the white men will camp -many hundreds of them, many thousands of them.  The Indians will learn
their ways, will live as they do, will become as they are.  There will
be no more great war dances, no more fights with other powerful tribes;
it will be as if the Indians had lost all bravery, all courage, all
confidence.'  He hated the voices, he hated the dream; but all his
power, all his big medicine, could not drive them away.  He was the
strongest man on all the North Pacific Coast.  He was mighty and very
tall, and his muscles were as those of Leloo, the timber wolf, when he
is strongest to kill his prey.  He could go for many days

<pb n="41"/>

without food; he could fight the largest mountain lion; he could
overthrow the fiercest grizzly bear; he could paddle against the wildest
winds and ride the highest waves.  He could meet his enemies and kill
whole tribes single-handed.  His strength, his courage, his power, his
bravery, were those of a giant.  He knew no fear; nothing in the sea, or
in the forest, nothing in the earth or the sky, could conquer him.  He
was fearless, fearless.  Only this haunting dream of the coming white
man's camp he could not drive away; it was the one thing in life he had
tried to kill and failed.  It drove him from the feasting, drove him
from the pleasant lodges, the fires, the dancing, the story-telling of
his people in their camp by the water's edge, where the salmon thronged
and the deer came down to drink of the mountain streams.  He left the
Indian village, chanting his wild songs as he went.  Up through the
mighty forests he climbed, through the trailless deep mosses and matted
vines, up to the summit of what the white men call Grouse Mountain.  For
many days he camped there.  He ate no food, he drank no water, but sat
and sang his medicine songs through the dark hours and through the day.
Before him &mdash; far beneath his feet -lay the narrow strip of land between
the two salt waters.  Then the Sagalie Tyee gave him the power to see
far into the future.  He looked across a hundred years, just as he
looked across what you call the Inlet, and he saw mighty lodges built
close together, hundreds and thousands of them; lodges of stone and
wood, and long straight trails to divide them.  He saw these trails
thronging with Palefaces; he heard the sound of the white man's
paddle-dip on the waters, for it is not silent like the Indian's; he saw
the white man's trading posts, saw the fishing nets, heard his speech.
Then the vision faded as gradually as it came.  The narrow strip of land
was his own forest once more.

</p><p>"'I am old,' he called, in his sorrow and his trouble for his
people.  'I am old, oh, Sagalie Tyee!  Soon I shall die and go to the
Happy Hunting Grounds of my fathers.  Let not my

<pb n="42"/>

strength die with me.  Keep living for all time my courage, my bravery,
my fearlessness.  Keep them for my people that they may be strong enough
to endure the white man's rule.  Keep my strength living for them; hide
it so that the Paleface may never find or see it.'

</p><p>"Then he came down from the summit of Grouse Mountain.  Still
chanting his medicine songs he entered his canoe, and paddled through
the colors of the setting sun far up the North Arm.  When night fell he
came to an island with misty shores of great grey rock; on its summit
tall pines and firs circled like a king's crown.  As he neared it he
felt all his strength, his courage, his fearlessness, leaving him; he
could see these things drift from him on to the island.  They were as
the clouds that rest on the mountains, grey-white and half transparent.
Weak as a woman he paddled back to the Indian village; he told them to
go and search for 'The Island,' where they would find all his courage,
his fearlessness and his strength, living, living forever.  He slept
then, but &mdash; in the morning he did not awake.  Since then our young men
and our old have searched for 'The Island.'  It is there somewhere, up
some lost channel, but we cannot find it.  When we do, we will get back
all the courage and bravery we had before the white man came, for the
great medicine man said those things never die &mdash; they live for one's
children and grandchildren."

</p><p>His voice ceased.  My whole heart went out to him in his longing
for the lost island.  I thought of all the splendid courage I knew him
to possess, so made answer: "But you say that the shadow of this island
has fallen upon you; is it not so, tillicum?"

</p><p>"Yes," he said half mournfully.  "But only the shadow."</p>

<head>Point Grey</head>

<p>HAVE you ever sailed around Point Grey?" asked a young Squamish
tillicum of mine who often comes to see me, to share a cup of tea and a
taste of muck-a-muck, that otherwise I should eat in solitude.

</p><p>"No," I admitted, I had not had that pleasure, for I did not know
the uncertain waters of English Bay sufficiently well to venture about
its headlands in my frail canoe.

</p><p>"Some day, perhaps next summer, I'll take you there in a
sail-boat, and show you the big rock at the southwest of the Point.  It
is a strange rock; we Indian people call it Homolsom."

</p><p>"What an odd name," I commented.  "Is it a Squamish word? &mdash; it
does not sound to me like one."

</p><p>"It is not altogether Squamish, but half Fraser River language.
The Point was the dividing line between the grounds and waters of the
two tribes, so they agreed to make the name 'Homolsom' from the two
languages."

</p><p>I suggested more tea, and, as he sipped it, he told me the legend
that few of the younger Indians know.  That he believes the story
himself is beyond question, for many times he admitted having tested the
virtues of this rock, and it had never once failed him.  All people that
have to do with water craft are superstitious about some things, and I
freely acknowledge that times innumerable I have "whistled up" a wind
when dead calm threatened, or stuck a jack-knife in the mast, and
afterwards watched with great contentment the idle sail fill, and the
canoe pull out to a light breeze.  So, perhaps, I am prejudiced in favor
of this legend of Homolsom Rock, for it strikes a very responsive chord
in that portion of my heart that has always throbbed for the sea.

</p><p>"You know," began my young tillicum, "that only waters unspoiled
by human hands can be of any benefit.  One gains no strength

<pb n="44"/>

by swimming in any waters heated or boiled by fires that men build.  To
grow strong and wise one must swim in the natural rivers, the mountain
torrents, the sea, just as the Sagalie Tyee made them.  Their virtues
die when human beings try to improve them by heating or distilling, or
placing even tea in them, and so &mdash; what makes Homolsom Rock so full of
'good medicine' is that the waters that wash up about it are straight
from the sea, made by the hand of the Great Tyee, and unspoiled by the
hand of man.

</p><p>"It was not always there, that great rock, drawing its strength
and its wonderful power from the seas, for it, too, was once a Great
Tyee, who ruled a mighty tract of waters.  He was god of all the waters
that wash the coast, of the Gulf of Georgia, of Puget Sound, of the
Straits of Juan de Fuca, of the waters that beat against even the west
coast of Vancouver Island, and of all the channels that cut between the
Charlotte Islands.  He was Tyee of the West Wind, and his storms and
tempests were so mighty that the Sagalie Tyee Himself could not control
the havoc that he created.  He warred upon all fishing craft, he
demolished canoes and sent men to graves in the sea.  He uprooted
forests and drove the surf on shore heavy with wreckage of despoiled
trees and with beaten and bruised fish.  He did all this to reveal his
powers, for he was cruel and hard of heart, and he would laugh and defy
the Sagalie Tyee, and looking up to the sky he would call, 'See how
powerful I am, how mighty, how strong; I am as great as you.'

</p><p>"It was at this time that the Sagalie Tyee in the persons of the
Four Men came in the great canoe up over the river of the Pacific, in
that age thousands of years ago when they turned the evil into stone,
and the kindly into trees.

</p><p>"'Now,' said the god of the West Wind, 'I can show how great I
am.  I shall blow a tempest that these men may not land on my coast.
They shall not ride my seas and sounds and channels in safety.  I shall
wreck them and send their bodies into the great deeps, and

<pb n="45"/>

I shall be Sagalie Tyee in their place and ruler of all the world.'  So
the god of the West Wind blew forth his tempests.  The waves arose
mountain high, the seas lashed and thundered along the shores.  The roar
of his mighty breath could be heard wrenching giant limbs from the
forest trees, whistling down the canyons and dealing death and
destruction for leagues and leagues along the coast.  But the canoe
containing the Four Men rode upright through all the heights and hollows
of the seething ocean.  No curling crest or sullen depth could wreck
that magic craft, for the hearts it bore were filled with kindness for
the human race, and kindness cannot die.

</p><p>"It was all rock and dense forest, and unpeopled; only wild
animals and sea birds sought the shelter it provided from the terrors of
the West Wind; but he drove them out in sullen anger, and made on this
strip of land his last stand against the Four Men.  The Paleface calls
the place Point Grey, but the Indians yet speak of it as 'The Battle
Ground of the West Wind.'  All his mighty forces he now brought to bear
against the oncoming canoe; he swept great hurricanes about its stony
ledges; he caused the sea to beat and swirl in tempestuous fury along
its narrow fastnesses, but the canoe came nearer and nearer, invincible
as those shores, and stronger than death itself.  As the bow touched the
land the Four Men arose and commanded the West Wind to cease his war
cry, and, mighty though he had been, his voice trembled and sobbed
itself into a gentle breeze, then fell to a whispering note, then faded
into exquisite silence.

</p><p>"'Oh, you evil one with the unkind heart,' cried the Four Men,
'you have been too great a god for even the Sagalie Tyee to obliterate
you forever, but you shall live on, live now to serve, not to hinder
mankind.  You shall turn into stone where you now stand, and you shall
rise only as men wish you to.  Your life from this day shall be for the
good of man, for when the fisherman's sails are idle and his lodge is
leagues away you shall fill those

<pb n="46"/>

sails and blow his craft free, in whatever direction he desires.  You
shall stand where you are through all the thousands upon thousands of
years to come, and he who touches you with his paddle-blade shall have
his desire of a breeze to carry him home.'"

</p><p>My young tillicum had finished his tradition, and his great
solemn eyes regarded me half-wistfully.

</p><p>"I wish you could see Homolsom Rock," he said.  "For that is he
who was once the Tyee of the West Wind."

</p><p>"Were you ever becalmed around Point Grey?" I asked irrelevantly.

</p><p>"Often," he replied.  "But I paddle up to the rock and touch it
with the tip of my paddle-blade, and no matter which way I want to go
the wind will blow free for me, if I wait a little while."

</p><p>"I suppose your people all do this?" I replied.

</p><p>"Yes, all of them," he answered.  "They have done it for hundreds
of years.  You see the power in it is just as great now as at first, for
the rock feeds every day on the unspoiled sea that the Sagalie Tyee
made."</p>

<head>The Tulameen Trail</head>

<p>DID you ever "holiday" through the valley lands of the Dry Belt?  Ever
spend days and days in a swinging, swaying coach, behind a four-in-hand,
when "Curly" or "Nicola Ned" held the ribbons, and tooled his knowing
little leaders and wheelers down those horrifying mountain trails that
wind like russet skeins of cobweb through the heights and depths of the
Okanagan, the Nicola and the Similkameen countries?  If so, you have
listened to the call of the Skookum Chuck, as the Chinook speakers call
the rollicking, tumbling streams that sing their way through the canyons
with a music so dulcet, so insistent, that for many moons the echo of it
lingers in your listening ears, and you will, through all the years to
come, hear the voices of those mountain rivers calling you to return.

</p><p>But the most haunting of all the melodies

</p><p>is the warbling laughter of the Tulameen; its delicate note is
far more powerful, more farreaching than the throaty thunders of
Niagara.  That is why the Indians of the Nicola country still cling to
their old-time story that the Tulameen carries the spirit of a young
girl enmeshed in the wonders of its winding course; a spirit that can
never free itself from the canyons, to rise above the heights and follow
its fellows to the Happy Hunting Grounds, but which is contented to
entwine its laughter, its sobs, its lonely whispers, its still lonelier
call for companionship, with the wild music of the waters that sing
forever beneath the western stars.

</p><p>As your horses plod up and up the almost perpendicular trail that
leads out of the Nicola Valley to the summit, a paradise of beauty
outspreads at your feet; the color is indescribable in words, the
atmosphere thrills you.  Youth and the pulse of rioting blood are yours
again, until, as you near the heights, you become strangely calmed by
the voiceless silence

<pb n="48"/>

of it all, a silence so holy that it seems the whole world about you is
swinging its censer before an altar in some dim remote cathedral!  The
choir voices of the Tulameen are yet very far away across the summit,
but the heights of the Nicola are the silent prayer that holds the human
soul before the first great chords swell down from the organ loft.  In
this first long climb up miles and miles of trail, even the staccato of
the drivers' long black-snake whip is hushed.  He lets his animals pick
their own sure-footed way, but once across the summit he gathers the
reins in his steely fingers, gives a low, quick whistle, the whiplash
curls about the ears of the leaders and the plunge down the dip of the
mountain begins.  Every foot of the way is done at a gallop.  The coach
rocks and swings as it dashes through a trail rough-hewn from the heart
of the forest; at times the angles are so abrupt that you cannot see the
heads of the leaders as they swing around the grey crags that almost
scrape the tires on the left, while within a foot of the rim of the
trail the right wheels whirl along the edge of a yawning canyon.  The
rhythms of the hoof-beats, the recurrent low whistle and crack of the
whiplash, the occasional rattle of pebbles showering down to the depths,
loosened by rioting wheels, have broken the sacred silence.  Yet above
all those nearby sounds there seems to be an indistinct murmur, which
grows sweeter, more musical, as you gain the base of the mountains,
where it rises above all harsher notes.  It is the voice of the restless
Tulameen as it dances and laughs through the rocky throat of the canyon,
three hundred feet below.  Then, following the song, comes a glimpse of
the river itself &mdash; white garmented in the film of its countless rapids,
its showers of waterfalls.  It is as beautiful to look at as to listen
to, and it is here, where the trail winds about and above it for
leagues, that the Indians say it caught the spirit of the maiden that is
still interlaced in its loveliness.

</p><p>It was in one of the terrible battles that raged between the
valley tribes before the white man's footprints were seen along these

<pb n="49"/>

trails.  None can now tell the cause of this warfare, but the
supposition is that it was merely for tribal supremacy &mdash; that primeval
instinct that assails the savage in both man and beast, that drives the
hill men to bloodshed and the leaders of buffalo herds to conflict.  It
is the greed to rule; the one barbarous instinct that civilization has
never yet been able to eradicate from armed nations.  This war of the
tribes of the valley lands was of years in duration; men fought and
women mourned, and children wept, as all have done since time began.  It
seemed an unequal battle, for the old experienced war-tried chief and
his two astute sons were pitted against a single young Tulameen brave.
Both factions had their loyal followers, both were indomitable as to
courage and bravery, both were determined and ambitious, both were
skilled fighters.

</p><p>But on the older man's side were experience and two other wary,
strategic brains to help him, while on the younger was but the advantage
of splendid youth and unconquerable persistence.  But at every pitched
battle, at every skirmish, at every single-handed conflict the younger
man gained little by little, the older man lost step by step.  The
experience of age was gradually but inevitably giving way to the
strength and enthusiasm of youth.  Then one day they met face to face
and alone &mdash; the old war-scarred chief, the young battle-inspired brave.
It was an unequal combat, and at the close of a brief but violent
struggle the younger had brought the older to his knees.  Standing over
him with up-poised knife the Tulameen brave laughed sneeringly, and
said:

</p><p>"Would you, my enemy, have this victory as your own?  If so, I
give it to you; but in return for my submission I demand of you -your
daughter."

</p><p>For an instant the old chief looked in wonderment at his
conqueror; he thought of his daughter only as a child who played about
the forest trails or sat obediently beside her mother in the lodge,
stitching her little moccasins or weaving her little baskets.

<pb n="50"/>

</p><p>"My daughter!" he answered sternly.  "My daughter &mdash; who is
barely out of her own cradle basket &mdash; give her to you, whose hands are
blood-dyed with the killing of a score of my tribe?  You ask for this
thing?"

</p><p>"I do not ask it," replied the young brave.  "I demand it; I have
seen the girl and I shall have her."

</p><p>The old chief sprang to his feet and spat out his refusal.  "Keep
your victory, and I keep my girl-child," though he knew he was not only
defying his enemy, but defying death as well.

</p><p>The Tulameen laughed lightly, easily.  "I shall not kill the sire
of my wife," he taunted.  "One more battle must we have, but your
girl-child will come to me."

</p><p>Then he took his victorious way up the trail, while the old chief
walked with slow and springless step down into the canyon.

</p><p>The next morning the chief's daughter was loitering along the
heights, listening to the singing river, and sometimes leaning over the
precipice to watch its curling eddies and dancing waterfalls.  Suddenly
she heard a slight rustle, as though some passing bird's wing had clipt
the air.  Then at her feet there fell a slender, delicately shaped
arrow.  It fell with spent force, and her Indian woodcraft told her it
had been shot to her, not at her.  She started like a wild animal.  Then
her quick eye caught the outline of a handsome, erect figure that stood
on the heights across the river.  She did not know him as her father's
enemy.  She only saw him to be young, stalwart and of extraordinary,
manly beauty.  The spirit of youth and of a certain savage coquetry
awoke within her.  Quickly she fitted one of her own dainty arrows to
the bow string and sent it winging across the narrow canyon; it fell,
spent, at his feet, and he knew she had shot it to him, not at him.

</p><p>Next morning, woman-like, she crept noiselessly to the brink of
the heights.  Would she see him again &mdash; that handsome brave?  Would he
speed another arrow to her?  She had not yet emerged from the tangle of
forest before it fell, its faint-winged flight heralding its

<pb n="51"/>

coming.  Near the feathered end was tied a tassel of beautiful ermine
tails.  She took from her wrist a string of shell beads, fastened it to
one of her little arrows and winged it across the canyon, as yesterday.

</p><p>The following morning before leaving the ledge she fastened the
tassel of ermine tails in her straight, black hair.  Would he see them?
But no arrow fell at her feet that day, but a clearer message was there
on the brink of the precipice.  He himself awaited her coming -he who
had never left her thoughts since that first arrow came to her from his
bow-string.  His eyes burned with warm fires, as she approached, but his
lips said simply: "I have crossed the Tulameen River."  Together they
stood, side by side, and looked down at the depths before them, watching
in silence the little torrent rollicking and roystering over its
boulders and crags.

</p><p>"That is my country," he said, looking across the river.  "This
is the country of your father, and of your brothers; they are my
enemies.  I return to my own shore tonight.  Will you come with me?"

</p><p>She looked up into his handsome young face.  So this was her
father's foe &mdash; the dreaded Tulameen!

</p><p>"Will you come?" he repeated.

</p><p>"I will come," she whispered.

</p><p>It was in the dark of the moon and through the kindly night he
led her far up the rocky shores to the narrow belt of quiet waters,
where they crossed in silence into his own country.  A week, a month, a
long golden summer, slipped by, but the insulted old chief and his
enraged sons failed to find her.

</p><p>Then one morning as the lovers walked together on the heights
above the far upper reaches of the river, even the ever-watchful eyes of
the Tulameen failed to detect the lurking enemy.  Across the narrow
canyon crouched and crept the two outwitted brothers of the girl-wife at
his side; their arrows were on their bow-strings, their hearts on fire
with hatred and vengeance.  Like two evilwinged birds of prey those
arrows sped across the laughing river, but before they found their

<pb n="52"/>

mark in the breast of the victorious Tulameen the girl had unconsciously
stepped before him.  With a little sigh, she slipped into his arms, her
brothers' arrows buried into her soft, brown flesh.

</p><p>It was many a moon before his avenging hand succeeded in slaying
the old chief and those two hated sons of his.  But when this was
finally done the handsome young Tulameen left his people, his tribe, his
country, and went into the far north.  "For," he said, as he sang his
farewell war song, "my heart lies dead in the Tulameen River."

</p><p> * * * * *

</p><p>But the spirit of his girl-wife still sings through the canyon,
its song blending with the music of that sweetest-voiced river in all
the great valleys of the Dry Belt.  That is why this laughter, the
sobbing murmur of the beautiful Tulameen will haunt for evermore the ear
that has once listened to its song.</p>

<head>The Grey Archway</head>

<p>THE steamer, like a huge shuttle, wove in and out among the countless
small islands; its long trailing scarf of grey smoke hung heavily along
the uncertain shores, casting a shadow over the pearly waters of the
Pacific, which sung lazily from rock to rock in indescribable beauty.

</p><p>After dinner I wandered astern with the traveller's ever-present
hope of seeing the beauties of a typical Northern sunset, and by some
happy chance I placed my deck stool near an old tillicum, who was
leaning on the rail, his pipe between his thin curved lips, his brown
hands clasped idly, his sombre eyes looking far out to sea, as though
they searched the future &mdash; or was it that they were seeing the past?

</p><p>"Kla-how-ya, tillicum!" I greeted

</p><p>He glanced round, and half smiled.

</p><p>"Kla-how-ya, tillicum!" he replied, with the warmth of
friendliness I have always met with among the Pacific tribes.

</p><p>I drew my deck stool nearer to him, and he acknowledged the
action with another half smile, but did not stir from his entrenchment,
remaining as if hedged about with an inviolable fortress of
exclusiveness.  Yet I knew that my Chinook salutation would be a
drawbridge by which I might hope to cross the moat into his castle of
silence.

</p><p>Indian-like, he took his time before continuing the acquaintance.
Then he began in most excellent English:

</p><p>"You do not know these Northern waters?"

</p><p>I shook my head.

</p><p>After many moments he leaned forward, looking along the curve of
the deck, up the channels and narrows we were threading, to a broad
strip of waters off the port bow.  Then he pointed, with that peculiar,
thoroughly Indian gesture of the palm, uppermost.

</p><p>"Do you see it &mdash; over there?  The small

<pb n="54"/>

It rests on the edge of the water, like a grey gull."

</p><p>It took my unaccustomed eyes some moments to discern it; then all
at once I caught its outline, veiled in the mists of distance &mdash; grey,
cobwebby, dreamy.

</p><p>"Yes," I replied, "I see it now.  You will tell me of it &mdash;tillicum?"

</p><p>He gave a swift glance at my dark skin, then nodded.  "You are
one of us," he said, with evidently no thought of a possible
contradiction.  "And you will understand, or I should not tell you.  You
will not smile at the story, for you are one of us."

</p><p>"I am one of you, and I shall understand," I answered.

</p><p>It was a full half-hour before we neared the island, yet neither
of us spoke during that time; then, as the "grey gull" shaped itself
into rock and tree and crag, I noticed in the very centre a stupendous
pile of stone lifting itself skyward, without fissure or cleft; but a
peculiar haziness about the base made me peer narrowly to catch the
perfect outline.

</p><p>"It is the 'Grey Archway,'" he explained, simply.

</p><p>Only then did I grasp the singular formation before us; the rock
was a perfect archway, through which we could see the placid Pacific
shimmering in the growing colors of the coming sunset at the opposite
rim of the island.

</p><p>"What a remarkable whim of Nature!" I exclaimed, but his brown
hand was laid in a contradictory grasp on my arm, and he snatched up my
comment almost with impatience.

</p><p>"No, it was not Nature," he said.  "That is the reason I say you
will understand &mdash; you are one of us &mdash; you will know what I tell you is
true.  The Great Tyee did not make that archway, it was &mdash;" here his
voice lowered -"it was magic, red man's medicine and magic &mdash; you
savvy?"

</p><p>"Yes," I said.  "Tell me, for I &mdash; savvy."

</p><p>"Long time ago," he began, stumbling into a half-broken English
language, because, I think, of the atmosphere and environment,

<pb n="55"/>

"long before you were born, or your father, or grandfather, or even his
father, this strange thing happened.  It is a story for women to hear,
to remember.  Women are the future mothers of the tribe, and we of the
Pacific Coast hold such in high regard, in great reverence.  The women
who are mothers &mdash; o-ho! -they are the important ones we say.  Warriors,
fighters, brave men, fearless daughters, owe their qualities to these
mothers &mdash; eh, is it not always so?"

</p><p>I nodded silently.  The island was swinging nearer to us, the
"Grey Archway" loomed almost above us, the mysticism crowded close, it
enveloped me, caressed me, appealed to me.

</p><p>"And?" I hinted.

</p><p>"And," he proceeded, "this 'Grey Archway' is a story of mothers,
of magic, of witchcraft, of warriors, of &mdash; love."

</p><p>An Indian rarely uses the word "love," and when he does it
expresses every quality, every attribute, every intensity, emotion and
passion embraced in those four little letters.  Surely this was an
exceptional story I was to hear.

</p><p>I did not answer, only looked across the pulsing waters toward
the "Grey Archway," which the sinking sun was touching with soft
pastels, tints one could give no name to, beauties impossible to
describe.

</p><p>"You have not heard of Yaada?" he questioned.  Then fortunately
he continued without waiting for a reply.  He well knew that I had never
heard of Yaada, so why not begin without preliminary to tell me of her?
&mdash; so -</p><p>"Yaada was the loveliest daughter of the Haida tribe.
Young braves from all the islands, from the mainland, from the upper
Skeena country came, hoping to carry her to their faroff lodges, but
they always returned alone.  She was the most desired of all the island
maidens, beautiful, brave, modest, the daughter of her own mother.

</p><p>"But there was a great man, a very great man &mdash; a medicine man,
skilful, powerful, influential, old, deplorably old, and very, very
rich; he said, 'Yaada shall be my wife.'  And there was a young
fisherman, handsome, loyal, boyish, poor, oh! very poor, and gloriously

<pb n="56"/>

young, and he, too, said, 'Yaada shall be my wife.'

</p><p>"But Yaada's mother sat apart and thought and dreamed, as mothers
will.  She said to herself, 'The great medicine man has power, has vast
riches, and wonderful magic, why not give her to him?  But Ulka has the
boy's heart, the boy's beauty, he is very brave, very strong; why not
give her to him?'

</p><p>"But the laws of the great Haida tribe prevailed.  Its wise men
said, 'Give the girl to the greatest man, give her to the most powerful,
the richest.  The man of magic must have his choice.'

</p><p>"But at this the mother's heart grew as wax in the summer
sunshine &mdash; it is a strange quality that mothers' hearts are made of!
'Give her to the best man &mdash; the man her heart holds highest,' said this
Haida mother.

</p><p>"Then Yaada spoke: 'I am the daughter of my tribe; I would judge
of men by their excellence.  He who proves most worthy I shall marry; it
is not riches that make a good husband; it is not beauty that makes a
good father for one's children.  Let me and my tribe see some proof of
the excellence of these two men &mdash; then, only, shall I choose who is to
be the father of my children.  Let us have a trial of their skill; let
them show me how evil or how beautiful is the inside of their hearts.
Let each of them throw a stone with some intent, some purpose in their
hearts.  He who makes the noblest mark may call me wife.'

</p><p>"'Alas!  Alas!' wailed the Haida mother 'This casting of stones
does not show worth.  It but shows prowess.'

</p><p>"'But I have implored the Sagalie Tyee of my father, and of his
fathers before him, to help me to judge between them by this means,'
said the girl.  'So they must cast the stones.  In this way only shall I
see their innermost hearts.'

</p><p>"The medicine man never looked so old as at that moment; so
hopelessly old, so wrinkled, so palsied: he was no mate for Yaada.  Ulka
never looked so god-like in his young beauty, so gloriously young, so
courageous.  The girl, looking at him, loved him &mdash; almost was she

<pb n="57"/>

placing her hand in his, but the spirit of her forefathers halted her.
She had spoken the word &mdash; she must abide by it.  'Throw!' she
commanded.

</p><p>"Into his shrivelled fingers the great medicine man took a small,
round stone, chanting strange words of magic all the while; his greedy
eyes were on the girl, his greedy thoughts about her.

</p><p>"Into his strong, young fingers Ulka took a smooth, flat stone;
his handsome eyes were lowered in boyish modesty, his thoughts were
worshipping her.  The great medicine man cast his missile first; it
swept through the air like a shaft of lightning, striking the great rock
with a force that shattered it.  At the touch of that stone the 'Grey
Archway' opened and has remained opened to this day.

</p><p>"'Oh, wonderful power and magic!' clamored the entire tribe.
'The very rocks do his bidding.'

</p><p>"But Yaada stood with eyes that burned in agony.  Ulka could
never command such magic &mdash; she knew it.  But at her side Ulka was
standing erect, tall, slender and beautiful, but just as he cast his
missile the evil voice of the old medicine man began a still more evil
incantation.  He fixed his poisonous eyes on the younger man, eyes with
hideous magic in their depths &mdash; ill-omened and enchanted with 'bad
medicine.'  The stone left Ulka's fingers; for a second it flew forth in
a straight line, then as the evil voice of the old man grew louder in
its incantations the stone curved.  Magic had waylaid the strong arm of
the young brave.  The stone poised an instant above the forehead of
Yaada's mother, then dropped with the weight of many mountains, and the
last long sleep fell upon her.

</p><p>"'Slayer of my mother!' stormed the girl, her suffering eyes
fixed upon the medicine man.  'Oh, I now see your black heart through
your black magic.  Through good magic you cut the 'Grey Archway,' but
your evil magic you used upon young Ulka.  I saw your wicked eyes upon
him; I heard your wicked incantations; I know your wicked heart.  You
used your heartless magic in

<pb n="58"/>

hope of winning me &mdash; in hope of making him an outcast of the tribe.
You cared not for my sorrowing heart, my motherless life to come.'
Then, turning to the tribe, she demanded: 'Who of you saw his evil eyes
fixed on Ulka?  Who of you heard his evil song?'

</p><p>"'I,' and 'I,' and 'I,' came voice after voice.

</p><p>"'The very air is poisoned that we breathe about him,' they
shouted.  'The young man is blameless, his heart is as the sun, but the
man who has used his evil magic has a heart black and cold as the hours
before the dawn.'

</p><p>"Then Yaada's voice arose in a strange, sweet, sorrowful chant:


</p><p>My feet shall walk no more upon this island,

</p><p> With its great, Grey Archway.

</p><p>My mother sleeps forever on this island,

</p><p> With its great, Grey Archway.

</p><p>My heart would break without her on this island,

</p><p> With its great, Grey Archway.


</p><p>My life was of her life upon this island,

</p><p> With its great, Grey Archway.

</p><p>My mother's soul has wandered from this island,

</p><p> With its great, Grey Archway.

</p><p>My feet must follow hers beyond this island,

</p><p> With its great, Grey Archway.


</p><p>"As Yaada chanted and wailed her farewell, she moved slowly
towards the edge of the cliff.  On its brink she hovered a moment with
outstretched arms, as a sea gull poises on its weight &mdash; then she
called:

</p><p>"'Ulka, my Ulka!  Your hand is innocent of wrong; it was the evil
magic of your rival that slew my mother.  I must go to her; even you
cannot keep me here; will you stay, or come with me?  Oh! my Ulka!"

</p><p>"The slender, gloriously young boy sprang toward her; their hands
closed one within the other; for a second they poised on the brink of
the rocks, radiant as stars; then together they plunged into the sea."

</p><p> * * * * * * *

</p><p>The legend was ended.  Long ago we had passed the island with its
"Grey Archway"; it was melting into the twilight, far astern.

</p><p>As I brooded over this strange tale of a daughter's devotion, I
watched the sea and sky for something that would give me a clue

<pb n="59"/>

to the inevitable sequel that the tillicum, like all his race, was
surely withholding until the opportune moment.

</p><p>Something flashed through the darkening waters not a stone's
throw from the steamer.  I leaned forward, watching it intently.  Two
silvery fish were making a succession of little leaps and plunges along
the surface of the sea, their bodies catching the last tints of sunset,
like flashing jewels.  I looked at the tillicum quickly.  He was
watching me &mdash; a world of anxiety in his half-mournful eyes.

</p><p>"And those two silvery fish?" I questioned.

</p><p>He smiled.  The anxious look vanished.  "I was right," he said;
"you do know us and our ways, for you are one of us.  Yes, those fish
are seen only in these waters; there are never but two of them.  They
are Yaada and her mate, seeking for the soul of the Haida woman &mdash; her
mother."</p>

<head>Deadman's Island</head>

<lg type="poem">
<l>It is dusk on the Lost Lagoon,</l>
<l>And we two dreaming the dusk away,</l>
<l>Beneath the drift of a twilight grey -Beneath the drowse of an ending
day</l>
<l>And the curve of a golden moon.</l>

<lb/>

<l>It is dark in the Lost Lagoon,
</l><l>And gone are the depths of haunting blue,
</l><l>The grouping gulls, and the old canoe,
</l><l>The singing firs, and the dusk and &mdash; you,
</l><l>And gone is the golden moon.</l>

<lb/>

<l>O! lure of the Lost Lagoon -I dream tonight that my paddle blurs
</l><l>The purple shade where the seaweed stirs -I hear the call of the singing firs
</l><l>In the hush of the golden moon.</l></lg>

<p>FOR many minutes we stood silently, leaning on the western rail of
the bridge as we watched the sun set across that beautiful little basin
of water known as Coal Harbor.  I have always resented that jarring,
unattractive name, for years ago, when I first plied paddle across the
gunwale of a light little canoe that idled above its margin, I named the
sheltered little cove the Lost Lagoon.  This was just to please my own
fancy, for as that perfect summer month drifted on, the ever-restless
tides left the harbor devoid of water at my favorite canoeing hour, and
my pet idling place was lost for many days -hence my fancy to call it
the Lost Lagoon.  But the chief, Indian-like, immediately adopted the
name, at least when he spoke of the place to me, and as we watched the
sun slip behind the rim of firs, he expressed the wish that his dugout
were here instead of lying beached at the farther side of the park.

</p><p>"If canoe was here, you and I we paddle close to shores all
'round your Lost Lagoon:  we make track just like half moon.  Then we
paddle under this bridge, and go channel between Deadman's Island and
park.  Then

<pb n="62"/>

'round where cannon speak time at nine o'clock.  Then 'cross Inlet to
Indian side of Narrows."

</p><p>I turned to look eastward, following in fancy the course he had
sketched; the waters were still as the footstep of the oncoming
twilight, and, floating in a pool of soft purple, Deadman's Island
rested like a large circle of candle moss.

</p><p>"Have you ever been on it?" he asked as he caught my gaze
centering on the irregular outline of the island pines.

</p><p>"I have prowled the length and depth of it," I told him.
"Climbed over every rock on its shores, crept under every tangled growth
of its interior, explored its overgrown trails, and more than once
nearly got lost in its very heart."

</p><p>"Yes," he half laughed, "it pretty wild; not much good for
anything."

</p><p>"People seem to think it valuable," I said.  "There is a lot of
litigation &mdash; of fighting going on now about it."

</p><p>"Oh! that the way always," he said as though speaking of a long
accepted fact.  "Always fight over that place.  Hundreds of years ago
they fight about it; Indian people; they say hundreds of years to come
everybody will still fight &mdash; never be settled what that place is, who
it belong to, who has right to it.  No, never settle.  Deadman's Island
always mean fight for someone."

</p><p>"So the Indians fought amongst themselves about it?" I remarked,
seemingly without guile, although my ears tingled for the legend I knew
was coming.

</p><p>"Fought like lynx at close quarters," he answered.  "Fought,
killed each other, until the island ran with blood redder than that
sunset, and the sea water about it was stained flame color &mdash; it was
then, my people say, that the scarlet fire-flower was first seen growing
along this coast."

</p><p>"It is a beautiful color &mdash; the fire-flower," I said.

</p><p>"It should be fine color, for it was born and grew from the
hearts of fine tribes-people -very fine people," he emphasized.

<pb n="63"/>

</p><p>We crossed to the eastern rail of the bridge, and stood watching
the deep shadows that gathered slowly and silently about the island; I
have seldom looked upon anything more peaceful.

</p><p>The chief sighed.  "We have no such men now, no fighters like
those men, no hearts, no courage like theirs.  But I tell you the story;
you understand it then.  Now all peace; tonight all good tillicums; even
dead man's spirit does not fight now, but long time after it happen
those spirits fought."

</p><p>"And the legend?" I ventured.

</p><p>"Oh! yes," he replied, as if suddenly returning to the present
from out a far country in the realm of time.  "Indian people, they call
it the 'Legend of the Island of Dead Men.'

</p><p>"There was war everywhere.  Fierce tribes from the northern
coast, savage tribes from the south all met here and battled and raided,
burned and captured, tortured and killed their enemies.  The forests
smoked with camp fires, the Narrows were choked with war canoes, and the
Sagalie Tyee &mdash; He who is a man of peace &mdash; turned His face away from
His Indian children.  About this island there was dispute and
contention.  The medicine men from the North claimed it as their
chanting ground.  The medicine men from the South laid equal claim to
it.  Each wanted it as the stronghold of their witchcraft, their magic.
Great bands of these medicine men met on the small space, using every
sorcery in their power to drive their opponents away.  The witch doctors
of the North made their camp on the northern rim of the island; those
from the South settled along the southern edge, looking towards what is
now the great city of Vancouver.  Both factions danced, chanted, burned
their magic powders, built their magic fires, beat their magic rattles,
but neither would give way, yet neither conquered.  About them, on the
waters, on the mainlands, raged the warfare of their respective tribes
&mdash; the Sagalie Tyee had forgotten His Indian children.

</p><p>"After many months, the warriors on both sides weakened.  They
said the incantations of the rival medicine men were bewitching

<pb n="64"/>

them, were making their hearts like children's, and their arms nerveless
as women's.  So friend and foe arose as one man and drove the medicine
men from the island, hounded them down the Inlet, herded them through
the Narrows and banished them out to sea, where they took refuge on one
of the outer islands of the gulf.  Then the tribes once more fell upon
each other in battle.

</p><p>"The warrior blood of the North will always conquer.  They are
the stronger, bolder, more alert, more keen.  The snows and the ice of
their country make swifter pulse than the sleepy suns of the South can
awake in a man; their muscles are of sterner stuff, their endurance
greater.  Yes, the northern tribes will always be victors.* But the
craft and the strategy of the southern tribes are hard things to battle
against.  While those of the North followed the medicine men farther out
to sea to make sure of their banishment, those from the South returned
under cover of night and seized the women and children and the old,
enfeebled men in their enemy's camp, transported them all to the Island
of Dead Men, and there held them as captives.  Their war canoes circled
the island like a fortification, through which drifted the sobs of the
imprisoned women, the mutterings of the aged men, the wail of little
children.

</p><p>"Again and again the men of the North assailed that circle of
canoes, and again and again were repulsed.  The air was thick with
poisoned arrows, the water stained with blood.  But day by day the
circle of southern canoes grew thinner and thinner; the northern arrows
were telling and truer of aim.  Canoes drifted everywhere, empty, or
worse still, manned only by dead men.  The pick of the southern warriors
had already fallen, when their greatest Tyee mounted a large rock on the
eastern shore.  Brave and unmindful of a thousand weapons aimed at his
heart, he uplifted his


</p><p>* Note.&mdash; It would almost seem that the chief knew that wonderful
poem of "The Khan's," "The Men of the Northern Zone," wherein he says:

</p><p> If ever a Northman lost a throne

</p><p> Did the conqueror come from the South?

</p><p> Nay, the North shall ever be free . . . etc.

<pb n="65"/>

hand, palm outward &mdash; the signal for conference.  Instantly every
northern arrow was lowered, and every northern ear listened for his
words.

</p><p>"'Oh! men of the upper coast,' he said, 'you are more numerous
than we are; your tribe is larger; your endurance greater.  We are
growing hungry, we are growing less in numbers.  Our captives &mdash; your
women and children and old men &mdash; have lessened, too, our stores of
food.  If you refuse our terms we will yet fight to the finish.
Tomorrow we will kill all our captives before your eyes, for we can feed
them no longer, or you can have your wives, your mothers, your fathers,
your children, by giving us for each and every one of them one of your
best and bravest young warriors, who will consent to suffer death in
their stead.  Speak!  You have your choice.'

</p><p>"In the northern canoes scores and scores of young warriors leapt
to their feet.  The air was filled with glad cries, with exultant
shouts.  The whole world seemed to ring with the voices of those young
men who called loudly, with glorious courage:

</p><p>"'Take me, but give me back my old father.'

</p><p>"'Take me, but spare to my tribe my little sister.'

</p><p>"'Take me, but release my wife and boybaby.'

</p><p>"So the compact was made.  Two hundred heroic, magnificent young
men paddled up to the island, broke through the fortifying circle of
canoes and stepped ashore.  They flaunted their eagle plumes with the
spirit and boldness of young gods.  Their shoulders were erect, their
step was firm, their hearts strong.  Into their canoes they crowded the
two hundred captives.  Once more their women sobbed, their old men
muttered, their children wailed, but those young copper-colored gods
never flinched, never faltered.  Their weak and their feeble were saved.
What mattered to them such a little thing as death?

</p><p>"The released captives were quickly surrounded by their own
people, but the flower of their splendid nation was in the hands of
their enemies, those valorous young men who

<pb n="66"/>

thought so little of life that they willingly, gladly laid it down to
serve and to save those they loved and cared for.  Amongst them were
war-tried warriors who had fought fifty battles, and boys not yet full
grown, who were drawing a bow string for the first time, but their
hearts, their courage, their self-sacrifice were as one.

</p><p>"Out before a long file of southern warriors they stood.  Their
chins uplifted, their eyes defiant, their breasts bared.  Each leaned
forward and laid his weapons at his feet, then stood erect, with empty
hands, and laughed forth their challenge to death.  A thousand arrows
ripped the air, two hundred gallant northern throats flung forth a death
cry exultant, triumphant as conquering kings &mdash; then two hundred
fearless northern hearts ceased to beat.

</p><p>"But in the morning the southern tribes found the spot where they
fell peopled with flaming fire-flowers.  Dread terror seized upon them.
They abandoned the island, and when night again shrouded them they
manned their canoes and noiselessly slipped through the Narrows, turned
their bows southward and this coast line knew them no more."

</p><p>"What glorious men," I half whispered as the chief concluded the
strange legend.

</p><p>"Yes, men!" he echoed.  "The white people call it Deadman's
Island.  That is their way; but we of the Squamish call it The Island of
Dead Men."

</p><p>The clustering pines and the outlines of the island's margin were
now dusky and indistinct.  Peace, peace lay over the waters, and the
purple of the summer twilight had turned to grey, but I knew that in the
depths of the undergrowth on Deadman's Island there blossomed a flower
of flaming beauty; its colors were veiled in the coming nightfall, but
somewhere down in the sanctuary of its petals pulsed the heart's blood
of many and valiant men.</p>

<head>A Squamish Legend of Napoleon</head>

<p>HOLDING an important place among the majority of curious tales held
in veneration by the coast tribes are those of the sea-serpent.  The
monster appears and reappears with almost monotonous frequency in
connection with history, traditions, legends and superstitions; but
perhaps the most wonderful part it ever played was in the great drama
that held the stage of Europe, and incidentally all the world during the
stormy days of the first Napoleon.

</p><p>Throughout Canada I have never failed to find an amazing
knowledge of Napoleon Bonaparte amongst the very old and "uncivilized"
Indians.  Perhaps they may be unfamiliar with every other historical
character from Adam down, but they will all tell you they have heard of
the "Great French Fighter," as they call the wonderful little Corsican.

</p><p>Whether this knowledge was obtained through the fact that our
earliest settlers and pioneers were French, or whether Napoleon's almost
magical fighting career attracted the Indian mind to the exclusion of
lesser warriors, I have never yet decided.  But the fact remains that
the Indians of our generation are not as familiar with Bonaparte's name
as were their fathers and grandfathers, so either the predominance of
English-speaking settlers or the thinning of their ancient war-loving
blood by modern civilization and peaceful times, must one or the other
account for the younger Indian's ignorance of the Emperor of the French.

</p><p>In telling me the legend of The Lost Talisman, my good tillicum,
the late Chief Capilano, began the story with the almost amazing
question, Had I ever heard of Napoleon Bonaparte?  It was some moments
before I just caught the name, for his English, always

<pb n="68"/>

quaint and beautiful, was at times a little halting; but when he said by
way of explanation, "You know big fighter, Frenchman.  The English they
beat him in big battle," I grasped immediately of whom he spoke.

</p><p>"What do you know of him?" I asked.

</p><p>His voice lowered, almost as if he spoke a state secret.  "I know
how it is that English they beat him."

</p><p>I have read many historians on this event, but to hear the
Squamish version was a novel and absorbing thing.  "Yes?" I said &mdash; my
usual "leading" word to lure him into channels of tradition.

</p><p>"Yes," he affirmed.  Then, still in a half whisper, he proceeded
to tell me that it all happened through the agency of a single joint
from the vertebra of a sea-serpent.

</p><p>In telling me the story of Brockton Point and the valiant boy who
killed the monster, he dwelt lightly on the fact that all people who
approach the vicinity of the creature are palsied, both mentally and
physically &mdash; bewitched, in fact &mdash; so that their bones become
disjointed and their brains incapable; but today he elaborated upon this
peculiarity until I harked back to the boy of Brockton Point and asked
how it was that his body and brain escaped this affliction.

</p><p>"He was all good, and had no greed," he replied.  "He proof
against all bad things."

</p><p>I nodded understandingly, and he proceeded to tell me that all
successful Indian fighters and warriors carried somewhere about their
person a joint of a sea-serpent's vertebra, that the medicine men threw
"the power" about them so that they were not personally affected by this
little "charm," but that immediately they approached an enemy the
"charm" worked disaster, and victory was assured the fortunate possessor
of the talisman.  There was one particularly effective joint that had
been treasured and carried by the warriors of a great Squamish family
for a century.  These warriors had conquered every foe they encountered,
until the talisman had become so renowned that the totem pole of their
entire "clan" was remodelled, and the new one

<pb n="69"/>

crested by the figure of a single joint of a seaserpent's vertebra.

</p><p>About this time stories of Napoleon's first great achievements
drifted across the seas; not across the land &mdash; and just here may be a
clue to buried, coast-Indian history, which those who are cleverer at
research than I, can puzzle over.  The chief was most emphatic about the
source of Indian knowledge of Napoleon.

</p><p>"I suppose you heard of him from Quebec, through, perhaps, some
of the French priests," I remarked.

</p><p>"No, no," he contradicted hurriedly.  "Not from East; we hear it
from over the Pacific, from the place they call Russia."  But who
conveyed the news or by what means it came he could not further
enlighten me.  But a strange thing happened to the Squamish family about
this time.  There was a large blood connection, but the only male member
living was a very old warrior, the hero of many battles, and the
possessor of the talisman.  On his death-bed his women of three
generations gathered about him; his wife, his sisters, his daughters,
his granddaughters, but not one man, nor yet a boy of his own blood
stood by to speed his departing warrior spirit to the land of peace and
plenty.

</p><p>"The charm cannot rest in the hands of women," he murmured almost
with his last breath.  "Women may not war and fight other nations or
other tribes; women are for the peaceful lodge and for the leading of
little children.  They are for holding baby hands, teaching baby feet to
walk.  No, the charm cannot rest with you, women.  I have no brother, no
cousin, no son, no grandson, and the charm must not go to a lesser
warrior than I.  None of our tribe, nor of any tribe on the coast, ever
conquered me.  The charm must go to one as unconquerable as I have been.
When I am dead send it across the great salt chuck, to the victorious
'Frenchman'; they call him Napoleon Bonaparte."  They were his last
words.

</p><p>The older women wished to bury the charm with him, but the
younger women, inspired with the spirit of their generation, were

<pb n="70"/>

determined to send it over seas.  "In the grave it will be dead," they
argued.  "Let it still live on.  Let it help some other fighter to
greatness and victory."

</p><p>As if to confirm their decision, the next day a small sealing
vessel anchored in the Inlet.  All the men aboard spoke Russian, save
two thin, dark, agile sailors, who kept aloof from the crew and
conversed in another language.  These two came ashore with part of the
crew and talked in French with a wandering Hudson's Bay trapper, who
often lodged with the Squamish people.  Thus the women, who yet mourned
over their dead warrior, knew these two strangers to be from the land
where the great "Frenchman" was fighting against the world.

</p><p>Here I interrupted the chief.  "How came the Frenchmen in a
Russian sealer?" I asked.

</p><p>"Captives," he replied.  "Almost slaves, and hated by their
captors, as the majority always hate the few.  So the women drew those
two Frenchmen apart from the rest and told them the story of the bone of
the sea-serpent, urging them to carry it back to their own country and
give it to the great 'Frenchman' who was as courageous and as brave as
their dead leader.

</p><p>"The Frenchmen hesitated; the talisman might affect them, they
said; might jangle their own brains, so that on their return to Russia
they would not have the sagacity to plan an escape to their own country;
might disjoint their bodies, so that their feet and hands would be
useless, and they would become as weak as children.  But the women
assured them that the charm only worked its magical powers over a man's
enemies, that the ancient medicine men had 'bewitched' it with this
quality.  So the Frenchmen took it and promised that if it were in the
power of man they would convey it to 'the Emperor.'

</p><p>"As the crew boarded the sealer, the women watching from the
shore observed strange contortions seize many of the men; some fell on
the deck; some crouched, shaking as with palsy; some writhed for a
moment, then fell limp and seemingly boneless; only the two

<pb n="71"/>

Frenchmen stood erect and strong and vital &mdash; the Squamish talisman had
already overcome their foes.  As the little sealer set sail up the gulf
she was commanded by a crew of two Frenchmen &mdash; men who had entered
these waters as captives, who were leaving them as conquerors.  The
palsied Russians were worse than useless, and what became of them the
chief could not state; presumably they were flung overboard, and by some
trick of a kindly fate the Frenchmen at last reached the coast of
France.

</p><p>Tradition is so indefinite about their movements subsequent to
sailing out of the Inlet, that even the ever-romantic and vividly
colored imaginations of the Squamish people have never supplied the
details of this beautifully childish, yet strangely historical fairy
tale.  But the voices of the trumpets of war, the beat of drums
throughout Europe heralded back to the wilds of the Pacific Coast
forests the intelligence that the great Squamish 'charm' eventually
reached the person of Napoleon; that from this time onward his career
was one vast victory, that he won battle after battle, conquered nation
after nation, and but for the direst calamity that could befall a
warrior would eventually have been master of the world.

</p><p>"What was this calamity, Chief?" I asked, amazed at his knowledge
of the great historical soldier and strategist.

</p><p>The chief's voice again lowered to a whisper &mdash; his face was
almost rigid with intentness as he replied:

</p><p>"He lost the Squamish charm &mdash; lost it just before one great
fight with the English people."

</p><p>I looked at him curiously; he had been telling me the oddest
mixture of history and superstition, of intelligence and ignorance, the
most whimsically absurd, yet impressive, tale I ever heard from Indian
lips.

</p><p>"What was the name of the great fight -did you ever hear it?" I
asked, wondering how much he knew of events which took place at the
other side of the world a century agone.

</p><p>"Yes," he said, carefully, thoughtfully; "I

<pb n="72"/>

hear the name sometime in London when I there.  Railroad station there
&mdash; same name."

</p><p>"Was it Waterloo?" I asked.

</p><p>He nodded quickly, without a shadow of hesitation.  "That the
one," he replied; "that's it, Waterloo."</p>

<head>The Lure in Stanley Park</head>

<p>THERE is a well-known trail in Stanley Park that leads to what I
always love to call the "Cathedral Trees" &mdash; that group of some
half-dozen forest giants that arch overhead with such superb loftiness.
But in all the world there is no cathedral whose marble or onyx columns
can vie with those straight, clean, brown cedar boles that teem with the
sap and blood of life.  There is no fresco that can rival the delicacy
of lace-work they have festooned between you and the far skies.  No
tiles, no mosaic or inlaid marbles, are as fascinating as the bare,
russet, fragrant floor outspreading about their feet.  They are the acme
of Nature's architecture, and in building them she has outrivalled all
her erstwhile conceptions.  She will never originate a more faultless
design, never erect a more perfect edifice.  But the divinely moulded
cedars and the man-made cathedral have one exquisite characteristic in
common.  It is the atmosphere of holiness.  Most of us have better
impulses after viewing a stately cathedral, and none of us can stand
amid that majestic group of cedars without experiencing some elevating
thoughts, some refinement of our coarser nature.  Perhaps those who read
this little legend will never again stand amid those cathedral trees
without thinking of the glorious souls they contain, for according to
the Coast Indians they do harbor human souls, and the world is better
because they once had the speech and the hearts of mighty men.

</p><p>My tillicum did not use the word "lure" in telling me this
legend.  There is no equivalent for the word in the Chinook tongue, but
the gestures of his voiceful hands so expressed the quality of something
between magnetism and charm that I have selected this word "lure" as
best fitting what he wished to convey.  Some few yards beyond the
cathedral trees, an overgrown disused trail turns into the

<pb n="74"/>

dense wilderness to the right.  Only Indian eyes could discern that
trail, and the Indians do not willingly go to that part of the park to
the right of the cedar group.  Nothing in this, nor yet the next world
would tempt a Coast Indian into the compact centres of the wild portions
of the park, for therein, concealed cunningly, is the "lure" they all
believe in.  There is not a tribe in the entire district that does not
know of this strange legend.  You will hear the tale from those that
gather at Eagle Harbor for the fishing, from the Fraser River tribes,
from the Squamish at the Narrows, from the Mission, from up the Inlet,
even from the tribes at North Bend, but no one will volunteer to be your
guide, for having once come within the "aura" of the lure it is a human
impossibility to leave it.  Your willpower is dwarfed, your intelligence
blighted, your feet will refuse to lead you out by a straight trail, you
will circle, circle for evermore about this magnet, for if death kindly
comes to your aid your immortal spirit will go on in that endless
circling that will bar it from entering the Happy Hunting Grounds.

</p><p>And, like the cathedral trees, the lure once lived, a human soul,
but in this instance it was a soul depraved, not sanctified.  The Indian
belief is very beautiful concerning the results of good and evil in the
human body.  The Sagalie Tyee (God) has His own way of immortalizing
each.  People who are wilfully evil, who have no kindness in their
hearts, who are bloodthirsty, cruel, vengeful, unsympathetic, the
Sagalie Tyee turns to solid stone that will harbor no growth, even that
of moss or lichen, for these stones contain no moisture, just as their
wicked hearts lacked the milk of human kindness.  The one famed
exception, wherein a good man was transformed into stone, was in the
instance of Siwash Rock, but as the Indian tells you of it he smiles
with gratification as he calls your attention to the tiny tree cresting
that imperial monument.  He says the tree was always there to show the
nations that the good in this man's heart kept on growing even when his
body had ceased

<pb n="75"/>

to be.  On the other hand the Sagalie Tyee transforms the kindly people,
the humane, sympathetic, charitable-loving people into trees, so that
after death they may go on forever benefiting all mankind; they may
yield fruit, give shade and shelter, afford unending service to the
living, by their usefulness as building material and as firewood.  Their
saps and gums, their fibres, their leaves, their blossoms, enrich,
nourish and sustain the human form; no evil is produced by trees &mdash; all,
all is goodness, is hearty, is helpfulness and growth.  They give refuge
to the birds, they give music to the winds, and from them are carved the
bows and arrows, the canoes and paddles, bowls, spoons and baskets.
Their service to mankind is priceless; the Indian that tells you this
tale will enumerate all these attributes and virtues of these trees.  No
wonder the Sagalie Tyee chose them to be the abode of souls good and
great.

</p><p>But the lure in Stanley Park is that most dreaded of all things,
an evil soul.  It is embodied in a bare, white stone, which is shunned
by moss and vine and lichen, but over which are splashed innumerable
jet-black spots that have eaten into the surface like an acid.

</p><p>This condemned soul once animated the body of a witch-woman, who
went up and down the coast, over seas and far inland, casting her evil
eye on innocent people, and bringing them untold evils and diseases.
About her person she carried the renowned "Bad Medicine" that every
Indian believes in -medicine that weakened the arm of the warrior in
battle, that caused deformities, that poisoned minds and characters,
that engendered madness, that bred plagues and epidemics; in short, that
was the seed of every evil that could befall mankind.  This witchwoman
herself was immune from death; generations were born and grew to old
age, and died, and other generations arose in their stead, but the
witch-woman went about, her heart set against her kind; her acts were
evil, her purposes wicked, she broke hearts and bodies and souls; she
gloried in tears, and revelled in unhappiness, and sent them

<pb n="76"/>

broadcast wherever she wandered.  And in his high heaven the Sagalie
Tyee wept with sorrow for his afflicted human children.  He dared not
let her die, for her spirit would still go on with its evil doing.  In
mighty anger he gave command to his Four Men (always representing the
Deity) that they should turn this witch-woman into a stone and enchain
her spirit in its centre, that the curse of her might be lifted from the
unhappy race.

</p><p>So the Four Men entered their giant canoe, and headed, as was
their custom, up the Narrows.  As they neared what is now known as
Prospect Point they heard from the heights above them a laugh, and
looking up they beheld the witch-woman jeering defiantly at them.  They
landed and, scaling the rocks, pursued her as she danced away, eluding
them like a will-o'-the-wisp as she called out to them sneeringly:

</p><p>"Care for yourselves, oh! men of the Sagalie Tyee, or I shall
blight you with my evil eye.  Care for yourselves and do not follow me."
On and on she danced through the thickest of the wilderness, on and on
they followed until they reached the very heart of the seagirt neck of
land we know as Stanley Park.  Then the tallest, the mightiest of the
Four Men, lifted his hand and cried out: "Oh!  woman of the stony heart,
be stone for evermore, and bear forever a black stain for each one of
your evil deeds."  And as he spoke the witch-woman was transformed into
this stone that tradition says is in the centre of the park.

</p><p>Such is the legend of the Lure, whether or not this stone is
really in existence &mdash; who knows?  One thing is positive, however, no
Indian will ever help to discover it.

</p><p>Three different Indians have told me that fifteen or eighteen
years ago two tourists &mdash; a man and a woman &mdash; were lost in Stanley
Park.  When found a week later, the man was dead, the woman mad, and
each of my informants firmly believed they had, in their wanderings,
encountered "the stone" and were compelled to circle around it, because
of its powerful lure.

</p><p>But this wild tale fortunately has a most beautiful conclusion.
The Four Men, fearing

<pb n="77"/>

that the evil heart imprisoned in the stone would still work
destruction, said: "At the end of the trail we must place so good and
great a thing that it will be mightier, stronger, more powerful than
this evil."  So they chose from the nations the kindliest, most
benevolent men, men whose hearts were filled with the love of their
fellow-beings, and transformed these merciful souls into the stately
group of "Cathedral Trees."

</p><p>How well the purpose of the Sagalie Tyee has wrought its effect
through time!  The good has predominated as He planned it to, for is not
the stone hidden in some unknown part of the park where eyes do not see
it and feet do not follow &mdash; and do not the thousands who come to us
from the nethermost parts of the world seek that wondrous beauty spot,
and stand awed by the majestic silence, the almost holiness of that
group of giant cedars?

</p><p>More than any other legend that the Indians about Vancouver have
told me does this tale reveal the love of the Coast native for kindness,
and his hatred of cruelty.  If these tribes really have ever been a
warlike race I cannot think they pride themselves much on the
occupation.  If you talk with any of them and they mention some man they
particularly like or admire, their first qualification of him is: "He's
a kind man."  They never say he is brave, or rich, or successful, or
even strong, that characteristic so loved by the red man.  To these
Coast tribes if a man is "kind" he is everything.  And almost without
exception their legends deal with rewards for tenderness and
self-abnegation, and personal and mental cleanliness.

</p><p>Call them fairy tales if you wish to, they all have a
reasonableness that must have originated in some mighty mind, and better
than that, they all tell of the Indian's faith in the survival of the
best impulses of the human heart, and the ultimate extinction of the
worst.

</p><p>In talking with my many good tillicums, I find this witch-woman
legend is the most universally known and thoroughly believed in of all
traditions they have honored me by revealing to me.</p>

<head>Deer Lake</head>

<p>FEW white men ventured inland, a century ago, in the days of the
first Chief Capilano, when the spoils of the mighty Fraser River poured
into copper-colored hands, but did not find their way to the remotest
corners of the earth, as in our times, when the gold from its sources,
the salmon from its mouth, the timber from its shores are world-known
riches.

</p><p>The fisherman's craft, the hunter's cunning were plied where now
cities and industries, trade and commerce, buying and selling hold sway.
In those days the moccasined foot awoke no echo in the forest trails.
Primitive weapons, arms, implements, and utensils were the only means of
the Indians' food-getting.  His livelihood depended upon his own
personal prowess, his skill in woodcraft and water lore.  And, as this
is a story of an elk-bone spear, the reader must first be in sympathy
with the fact that this rude instrument, deftly fashioned, was of
priceless value to the first Capilano, to whom it had come through three
generations of ancestors, all of whom had been experienced hunters and
dexterous fishermen.

</p><p>Capilano himself was without a rival as a spearsman.  He knew the
moods of the Fraser River, the habits of its thronging tenants, as no
other man has ever known them before or since.  He knew every isle and
inlet along the coast, every boulder, the sand-bars, the still pools,
the temper of the tides.  He knew the spawning grounds, the secret
streams that fed the larger rivers, the outlets of rock-bound lakes, the
turns and tricks of swirling rapids.  He knew the haunts of bird and
beast and fish and fowl, and was master of the arts and artifice that
man must use when matching his brain against the eluding wiles of the
untamed creatures of the wilderness.

</p><p>Once only did his cunning fail him, once

<pb n="80"/>

only did Nature baffle him with her mysterious fabric of waterways and
land lures.  It was when he was led to the mouth of the unknown river,
which has evaded discovery through all the centuries, but which &mdash; so
say the Indians &mdash; still sings on its way through some buried channel
that leads from the lake to the sea.

</p><p>He had been sealing along the shores of what is now known as
Point Grey.  His canoe had gradually crept inland, skirting up the coast
to the mouth of False Creek.  Here he encountered a very king of seals,
a colossal creature that gladdened the hunter's eyes as game worthy of
his skill.  For this particular prize he would cast the elk-bone spear.
It had never failed his sire, his grandsire, his greatgrandsire.  He
knew it would not fail him now.  A long, pliable, cedar-fibre rope lay
in his canoe.  Many expert fingers had woven and plaited that rope, had
beaten and oiled it until it was soft and flexible as a serpent.  This
he attached to the spearhead, and with deft, unerring aim cast it at the
king seal.  The weapon struck home.  The gigantic creature shuddered
and, with a cry like a hurt child, it plunged down into the sea.  With
the rapidity and strength of a giant fish it scudded inland with the
rising tide, while Capilano paid out the rope its entire length, and, as
it stretched taut, felt the canoe leap forward, propelled by the mighty
strength of the creature which lashed the waters into whirlpools, as
though it was possessed with the power and properties of a whale.

</p><p>Up the stretch of False Creek the man and monster drove their
course, where a century hence great city bridges were to over-arch the
waters.  They strove and struggled each for the mastery, neither of them
weakened, neither of them faltered &mdash; the one dragging, the other
driving.  In the end it was to be a matching of brute and human wits,
not forces.  As they neared the point where now Main Street bridge
flings its shadow across the waters, the brute leaped high into the air,
then plunged headlong into the depths.  The impact ripped the rope from
Capilano's hands.  It rattled

<pb n="81"/>

across the gunwale.  He stood staring at the spot where it had
disappeared &mdash; the brute had been victorious.  At low tide the Indian
made search.  No trace of his game, of his precious elk-bone spear, of
his cedar-fibre rope, could be found.  With the loss of the latter he
firmly believed his luck as a hunter would be gone.  So he patrolled the
mouth of False Creek for many moons.  His graceful, high-bowed canoe
rarely touched other waters, but the seal king had disappeared.  Often
he thought long strands of drifting sea grasses were his lost
cedar-fibre rope.  With other spears, with other cedar-fibres, with
paddle blade and cunning traps he dislodged the weeds from their
moorings, but they slipped their slimy lengths through his eager hands:
his best spear with its attendant coil was gone.

</p><p>The following year he was sealing again off the coast of Point
Grey, and one night after sunset he observed the red reflection from the
west, which seemed to transfer itself to the eastern skies.  Far into
the night dashes of flaming scarlet pulsed far beyond the head of False
Creek.  The color rose and fell like a beckoning hand, and, Indian-like,
he immediately attached some portentous meaning to the unusual sight.
That it was some omen he never doubted, so he paddled inland, beached
his canoe, and took the trail towards the little group of lakes that
crowd themselves into the area that lies between the present cities of
Vancouver and New Westminster.  But long before he reached the shores of
Deer Lake he discovered that the beckoning hand was in reality flame.
The little body of water was surrounded by forest fires.  One avenue
alone stood open.  It was a group of giant trees that as yet the flames
had not reached.  As he neared the point he saw a great moving mass of
living things leaving the lake and hurrying northward through this one
egress.  He stood, listening, intently watching with alert eyes; the
swirr of myriads of little travelling feet caught his quick ear &mdash; the
moving mass was an immense colony of beaver.  Thousands upon thousands
of them.  Scores of baby beavers staggered along, following

<pb n="82"/>

their mothers; scores of older beavers that had felled trees and built
dams through many seasons; a countless army of trekking fur beavers, all
under the generalship of a wise old leader, who, as king of the colony,
advanced some few yards ahead of his battalions.  Out of the waters
through the forest towards the country to the north they journeyed.
Wandering hunters said they saw them cross Burrard Inlet at the Second
Narrows, heading inland as they reached the farther shore.  But where
that mighty army of royal little Canadians set up their new colony, no
man knows.  Not even the astuteness of the first Capilano ever
discovered their destination.  Only one thing was certain, Deer Lake
knew them no more.

</p><p>After their passing, the Indian retraced their trail to the
water's edge.  In the red glare of the encircling fires he saw what he
at first thought was some dead and dethroned king beaver on the shore.
A huge carcass lay half in, half out, of the lake.  Approaching it he
saw the wasted body of a giant seal.  There could never be two seals of
that marvellous size.  His intuition now grasped the meaning of the omen
of the beckoning flame that had called him from the far coasts of Point
Grey.  He stooped above his dead conqueror and found, embedded in its
decaying flesh, the elkbone spear of his forefathers, and trailing away
at the water's rim was a long flexible cedar-fibre rope.

</p><p>As he extracted this treasured heirloom he felt the "power," that
men of magic possess, creep up his sinewy arms.  It entered his heart,
his blood, his brain.  For a long time he sat and chanted songs that
only great medicine men may sing, and, as the hours drifted by, the heat
of the forest fires subsided, the flames diminished into smouldering
blackness.  At daybreak the forest fire was dead, but its beckoning
fingers had served their purpose.  The magic elk-bone spear had come
back to its own.

</p><p>Until the day of his death the first Capilano searched for the
unknown river up which the seal travelled from False Creek to Deer Lake,

<pb n="83"/>

but its channel is a secret that even Indian eyes have not seen.

</p><p>But although those of the Squamish tribe tell and believe that
the river still sings through its hidden trail that leads from Deer Lake
to the sea, its course is as unknown, its channel is as hopelessly lost
as the brave little army of beavers that a century ago marshalled their
forces and travelled up into the great lone north.</p>

<head>A Royal Mohawk Chief</head>

<p>HOW many Canadians are aware that in Prince Arthur, Duke of
Connaught, and only surviving son of Queen Victoria, who has been
appointed to represent King George V in Canada, they undoubtedly have
what many wish for &mdash; one bearing an ancient Canadian title as
Governor-General of all the Dominion?  It would be difficult to find a
man more Canadian than any one of the fifty chiefs who compose the
parliament of the ancient Iroquois nation, that royal race of Redskins
that has fought for the British crown against all of the enemies
thereof, adhering to the British flag through the wars against both the
French and the colonists.

</p><p>Arthur Duke of Connaught is the only living white man who to-day
has an undisputed right to the title of "Chief of the Six Nations
Indians" (known collectively as the Iroquois).  He possesses the
privilege of sitting in their councils, of casting his vote on all
matters relative to the governing of the tribes, the disposal of
reservation lands, the appropriation of both the principal and interest
of the more than half a million dollars these tribes hold in Government
bonds at Ottawa, accumulated from the sales of their lands.  In short,
were every drop of blood in his royal veins red, instead of blue, he
could not be more fully qualified as an Indian chief than he now is, not
even were his title one of the fifty hereditary ones whose illustrious
names composed the Iroquois confederacy before the Paleface ever set
foot in America.

</p><p>It was on the occasion of his first visit to Canada in 1869, when
he was little more than a boy, that Prince Arthur received, upon his
arrival at Quebec, an address of welcome from his Royal mother's "Indian
Children" on the Grand River Reserve, in Brant county, Ontario.  In
addition to this welcome they had a request to make of him: would he

<pb n="86"/>

accept the title of Chief and visit their reserve to give them the
opportunity of conferring it?

</p><p>One of the great secrets of England's success with savage races
has been her consideration, her respect, her almost reverence of native
customs, ceremonies and potentates.  She wishes her own customs and
kings to be honored, so she freely accords like honor to her subjects,
it matters not whether they be white, black or red.

</p><p>Young Arthur was delighted &mdash; royal lads are pretty much like all
other boys; the unique ceremony would be a break in the endless round of
state receptions, banquets and addresses.  So he accepted the Red
Indians' compliment, knowing well that it was the loftiest honor those
people could confer upon a white man.

</p><p>It was the morning of October first when the royal train steamed
into the little city of Brantford, where carriages awaited to take the
Prince and his suite to the "Old Mohawk Church," in the vicinity of
which the ceremony was to take place.  As for the Prince's especial
escort, Onwanonsyshon, head chief of the Mohawks, rode on a jet-black
pony beside the carriage.  The chief was garmented in full native
costume &mdash; a buckskin suit, beaded moccasins, headband of owl's and
eagle's feathers, and ornaments hammered from coin silver that literally
covered his coat and leggings.  About his shoulders was flung a scarlet
blanket, consisting of the identical broadcloth from which the British
army tunics are made; this he "hunched" with his shoulders from time to
time in true Indian fashion.  As they drove along, the Prince chatted
boyishly with his Mohawk escort, and once leaned forward to pat the
black pony on its shining neck and speak admiringly of it.  It was a
warm autumn day: the roads were dry and dusty, and, after a mile or so,
the boy-prince brought from beneath the carriage seat a basket of
grapes.  With his handkerchief he flicked the dust from them, handed a
bunch to the chief and took one himself.  An odd spectacle to be
traversing a country road: an English

<pb n="87"/>

prince and an Indian chief, riding amicably side-by-side, enjoying a
banquet of grapes like two schoolboys.

</p><p>On reaching the church, Arthur leapt lightly to the green sward.
For a moment he stood, rigid, gazing before him at his future
brother-chiefs.  His escort had given him a faint idea of what he was to
see, but he certainly never expected to be completely surrounded by
three hundred full-blooded Iroquois braves and warriors, such as now
encircled him on every side.  Every Indian was in war paint and
feathers, some stripped to the waist, their copper-colored skins
brilliant with paints, dyes and "patterns"; all carried tomahawks,
scalping-knives, and bows and arrows.  Every red throat gave a
tremendous war-whoop as he alighted, which was repeated again and again,
as for that half moment he stood silent, a slim boyish figure, clad in
light grey tweeds &mdash; a singular contrast to the stalwarts in gorgeous
costumes who crowded about him.  His young face paled to ashy whiteness,
then with true British grit he extended his right hand and raised his
black "billy-cock" hat with his left.  At the same time he took one step
forward.  Then the war cries broke forth anew, deafening, savage,
terrible cries, as one by one the entire three hundred filed past, the
Prince shaking hands with each one, and removing his glove to do so.
This strange reception over, Onwanonsyshon rode up, and, flinging his
scarlet blanket on the grass, dismounted, and asked the Prince to stand
on it.

</p><p>Then stepped forward an ancient chief, father of Onwanonsyshon,
and Speaker of the Council.  He was old in inherited and personal
loyalty to the British crown.  He had fought under Sir Isaac Brock at
Queenston Heights in 1812, while yet a mere boy, and upon him was laid
the honor of making his Queen's son a chief.  Taking Arthur by the hand
this venerable warrior walked slowly to and fro across the blanket,
chanting as he went the strange, wild formula of induction.  From time
to time he was interrupted by loud expressions of approval and assent
from the vast throng of

<pb n="88"/>

encircling braves, but apart from this no sound was heard but the low,
weird monotone of a ritual older than the white man's footprints in
North America.

</p><p>It is necessary that a chief of each of the three "clans" of the
Mohawks shall assist in this ceremony.  The veteran chief, who sang the
formula, was of the Bear clan.  His son, Onwanonsyshon, was of the Wolf
(the clanship descends through the mother's side of the family).  Then
one other chief, of the Turtle clan, and in whose veins coursed the
blood of the historic Brant, now stepped to the edge of the scarlet
blanket.  The chant ended, these two young chiefs received the Prince
into the Mohawk tribe, conferring upon him the name of "Kavakoudge,"
which means "the sun flying from East to West under the guidance of the
Great Spirit."

</p><p>Onwanonsyshon then took from his waist a brilliant deep-red sash,
heavily embroidered with beads, porcupine quills and dyed moose hair,
placing it over the Prince's left shoulder and knotting it beneath his
right arm.  The ceremony was ended.  The Constitution that Hiawatha had
founded centuries ago, a Constitution wherein fifty chiefs, no more, no
less, should form the parliament of the "Six Nations," had been
shattered and broken, because this race of loyal red men desired to do
honor to a slender young boy-prince, who now bears the fifty-first title
of the Iroquois.

</p><p>Many white men have received from these same people honorary
titles, but none has been bestowed through the ancient ritual, with the
imperative members of the three clans assisting, save that borne by
Arthur of Connaught.

</p><p>After the ceremony the Prince entered the church to autograph his
name in the ancient Bible, which, with a silver Holy Communion service,
a bell, two tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments, and a bronze
British coat-of-arms, had been presented to the Mohawks by Queen Anne.
He inscribed "Arthur" just below the "Albert Edward," which, as Prince
of Wales, the late king wrote when he visited Canada in 1860.

<pb n="89"/>

</p><p>When he returned to England, Chief Kavakoudge sent his portrait,
together with one of Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort, to be placed
in the Council House of the "Six Nations," where they decorate the walls
today.

</p><p>As I write, I glance up to see, in a corner of my room, a draping
scarlet blanket, made of British army broadcloth, for the chief who rode
the jet-black pony so long ago was the writer's father.  He was not here
to wear it when Arthur of Connaught again set foot on Canadian shores.

</p><p>Many of these facts I have culled from a paper that lies on my
desk; it is yellowing with age, and bears the date, "Toronto, October 2,
1869," and on the margin is written in a clear, half-boyish hand,
"Onwanonsyshon, with kind regards from your brother-chief, Arthur."</p>
