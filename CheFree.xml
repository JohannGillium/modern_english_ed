<head>The Free Colored People of North Carolina<lb/>
                      CHARLES W. CHESNUTT</head>

<p>IN our generalizations upon American history &mdash; and the American
people are prone to loose generalization, especially where the
Negro is concerned &mdash; it is ordinarily assumed that the entire colored
race was set free as the result of the Civil War.  While this is true in
a broad, moral sense, there was, nevertheless, a very considerable technical exception in the case of several hundred thousand free people of
color, a great many of whom were residents of the Southern States.
Although the emancipation of their race brought to these a larger
measure of liberty than they had previously enjoyed, it did not confer
upon them personal freedom, which they possessed already.  These
free colored people were variously distributed, being most numerous,
perhaps, in Maryland, where, in the year 1850, for example, in a state
with 87,189 slaves, there were 83,942 free colored people, the white population of the State being 515,918; and perhaps least numerous in
Georgia, of all the slave states, where, to a slave population of 462,198,
there were only 351 free people of color, or less than three-fourths of
one per cent., as against the about fifty per cent. in Maryland.  Next
to Maryland came Virginia, with 58,042 free colored people, North
Carolina with 30,463, Louisiana with 18,647, (of whom 10,939 were in
the parish of New Orleans alone), and South Carolina with 9,914.
For these statistics, I have of course referred to the census reports
for the years mentioned.  In the year 1850, according to the same
authority, there were in the state of North Carolina 553,028 white people, 288,548 slaves, and 27,463 free colored people.  In 1860, the white
population of the state was 631,100, slaves 331,059, free colored people, 30,463.
</p><p>     These figures for 1850 and 1860 show that between nine and ten
per cent. of the colored population, and about three per cent. of the
total population in each of those years, were free colored people, the
ratio of increase during the intervening period being inconsiderable.
In the decade preceding 1850 the ratio of increase had been somewhat
different.  From 1840 to 1850 the white population of the state had
increased 14.05 per cent., the slave population 17.38 per cent., the free
colored population 20.81 per cent.  In the long period from 1790 to
1860, during which the total percentage of increase for the whole population of the state was 700.16, that of the whites was 750.30 per cent.,
that of the free colored people 720.65 per cent., and that of the slave
population but 450 per cent., the total increase in free population being
747.56 per cent.
</p><p>It seems altogether probable that but for the radical change in
the character of slavery, following the invention of the cotton-gin and
the consequent great demand for laborers upon the far Southern
   <pb n="137"/>
plantations, which turned the border states into breeding-grounds for
slaves, the forces of freedom might in time have overcome those of
slavery, and the institution might have died a natural death, as it already had in the Northern States, and as it subsequently did in Brazil
and Cuba.  To these changed industrial conditions was due, in all
probability, in the decade following 1850, the stationary ratio of free
colored people to slaves against the larger increase from 1840 to 1850.
The gradual growth of the slave power had discouraged the manumission of slaves, had resulted in legislation curtailing the rights and
privileges of free people of color, and had driven many of these to seek
homes in the North and West, in communities where, if not warmly
welcomed as citizens, they were at least tolerated as freemen.
</p><p>     This free colored population was by no means evenly distributed
throughout the state, but was mainly found along or near the eastern
seaboard, in what is now known as the "black district" of North Carolina.  In Craven county, more than one-fifth of the colored
population were free; in Halifax county, where the colored population was
double that of the whites, one-fourth of the colored were free.  In
Hertford county, with 3,947 whites and 4,445 slaves, there were 1,112
free colored.  In Pasquotank county, with a white and colored population almost evenly balanced, one-third of the colored people were free.
In some counties, for instance in that of Jackson, a mountainous county in the west of the state, where the Negroes were but an insignificant
element, the population stood 5,241 whites, 268 slaves, and three free
colored persons.
</p><p>     The growth of this considerable element of free colored people
had been due to several causes.  In the eighteenth century, slavery in
North Carolina had been of a somewhat mild character.  There had
been large estates along the seaboard and the water-courses, but the
larger part of the population had been composed of small planters or
farmers, whose slaves were few in number, too few indeed to be herded into slave quarters, but employed largely as domestic servants, and
working side by side with their masters in field and forest, and sharing with them the same rude fare.  The Scotch-Irish Presbyterian
strain in the white people of North Carolina brought with it a fierce love
of liberty, which was strongly manifested, for example, in the Mecklenburg declaration of independence, which preceded that at Philadelphia;
and while this love of liberty was reconciled with slavery, the mere
prejudice against race had not yet excluded all persons of Negro blood
from its benign influence.  Thus, in the earlier history of the state,
the civil status of the inhabitants was largely regulated by condition
rather than by color.  To be a freeman meant to enjoy many of the
fundamental rights of citizenship.  Free men of color in North Carolina exercised the right of suffrage until 1835, when the constitution
was amended to restrict this privilege to white men.  It may be remarked, in passing, that prior to 1860,
Jews could not vote in North
Carolina.  The right of marriage between whites and free persons of
   <pb n="138"/>
color was not restricted by law until the year 1830, though social prejudice had always discouraged it.
</p><p>     The mildness of slavery, which fostered kindly feelings between
master and slave, often led to voluntary manumission.  The superior
morality which characterized the upper ranks of white women, so adequately protected by slavery, did not exist in anything like the same
degree among the poorer classes, and occasional marriages, more or
less legal, between free Negroes and slaves and poor white women, resulted in at least a small number of colored children, who followed the
condition of their white mothers.  I have personal knowledge of two
free colored families of such origin, dating back to the eighteenth century, whose descendants in each case run into the hundreds.  There
was also a considerable Quaker element in the population, whose influence was cast against slavery, not in any fierce polemical spirit, but
in such a way as to soften its rigors and promote gradual emancipation.
Another source of free colored people in certain counties was the remnant of the Cherokee and Tuscarora Indians, who, mingling with the
Negroes and poor whites, left more or less of their blood among the
colored people of the state.  By the law of <hi rend="italic">partitus sequitur ventrem</hi>,
which is a law of nature as well as of nations, the child of a free mother was always free, no matter what its color or the status of its father,
and many free colored people were of female Indian ancestry.
</p><p>     One of these curiously mixed people left his mark upon the history of the state &mdash; a bloody mark, too, for the Indian in him did not pass-ively endure the things to which the Negro strain rendered him subject.  Henry Berry Lowrey was what was known as a "Scuffletown mu-latto"   Scuffletown being a rambling community in Robeson county,
N. C., inhabited mainly by people of this origin.  His father, a prosperous farmer, was impressed, like other free Negroes, during the Civ-il War, for service upon the Confederate public works.  He resisted
and was shot to death with several sons who were assisting him.  A
younger son, Henry Berry Lowrey, swore an oath to avenge the injury, and a few years later carried it out with true Indian persistence
and ferocity.  During a career of murder and robbery extending over
several years, in which he was aided by an organized band of desperadoes who rendezvoused in inaccessible swamps and terrorized the
county, he killed every white man concerned in his father's death, and
incidentally several others who interfered with his plans, making in all
a total of some thirty killings.  A body of romance grew up about this
swarthy Robin Hood, who, armed to the teeth, would freely walk into
the towns and about the railroad stations, knowing full well that there
was a price upon his head, but relying for safety upon the sympathy of
the blacks and the fears of the whites.  His pretty yellow wife, "Rhody," was known as "the queen of Scuffletown."  Northern reporters
came down to write him up.  An astute Boston detective who penetrated, under false colors, to his stronghold, is said to have been put to
death with savage tortures.  A state official was once conducted, by
   <pb n="139"/>
devious paths, under Lowrey's safeguard, to the outlaw's camp, in order that he might see for himself how difficult it would be to dislodge
them.  A dime novel was founded upon his exploits.  The state offered ten thousand, the Federal government, five thousand dollars for
his capture, and a regiment of Federal troops was sent to subdue him,
his career resembling very much that of the picturesque Italian bandit who
has recently been captured after a long career of crime.  Lowrey only
succumbed in the end to a bullet from the hand of a treacherous
comrade, and there is even yet a tradition that he escaped and made
his way to a distant state.  Some years ago these mixed Indians and
Negroes were recognized by the North Carolina legislature as "Croatan
Indians," being supposed to have descended from a tribe of that name
and the whites of the lost first white colony of Virginia.  They are allowed,
among other special privileges conferred by this legislation, to have
separate schools of their own, being placed, in certain other respects,
upon a plane somewhat above that of the Negroes and a little below
that of the whites.
</p><p>     I may add that North Carolina was a favorite refuge for runaway
slaves and indentured servants from the richer colonies north and south
of it.  It may thus be plainly seen how a considerable body of free
colored people sprang up within the borders of the state.
</p><p>     The status of these people, prior to the Civil War, was anomalous
but tenable.  Many of them, perhaps most of them, were as we have
seen, persons of mixed blood, and received, with their dower of white
blood, an intellectual and physical heritage of which social prejudice
could not entirely rob them, and which helped them to prosperity in
certain walks of life.  The tie of kinship was sometimes recognized,
and brought with it property, sympathy and opportunity which the
black did not always enjoy.  Many free colored men were skilled
mechanics.  The State House at Raleigh was built by colored workmen,
under a foreman of the same race.  I am acquainted with a family now
living in the North, whose Negro grandfather was the leading tailor, in
Newbern, N. C.  He owned a pew on the ground floor of the church
which he attended, and was buried in the cemetery where white people
were laid to rest.  In the town where I went to live when a child,
just after the Civil War, nearly all the mechanics were men of color.
One of these, a saddler by trade, had himself been the owner, before
the war, of a large plantation and several slaves.  He had been
constrained by force of circumstances to invest in Confederate bonds, but
despite this loss, he still had left a considerable tract of land, a brick
store, and a handsome town residence, and was able to send one of his
sons, immediately after the war, to a Northern school, where he read law,
and returning to his native state, was admitted to the bar and has ever
since practiced his profession.  This was an old free family,
descended from a free West Indian female ancestor.  For historical reasons,
which applied to the whole race, slave and free, these families were,
before the war, most clearly traceable through the female line.
   <pb n="140"/>
</p><p>     The principal cabinet-maker and undertaker in the town was an
old white man whose workmen were colored.  One of these
practically inherited what was left of the business after the introduction of
factory-made furniture from the North, and has been for many years
the leading undertaker of the town.  The tailors, shoemakers,
wheelwrights and blacksmiths were men of color, as were the carpenters,
bricklayers and plasterers.
</p><p>     It is often said, as an argument for slavery, by the still numerous
apologists for that institution, that these skilled artisans have not
passed on to the next generation the trades acquired by them under, if not
in, slavery.  This failure is generally ascribed to the shiftlessness of
the race in freedom, and to the indisposition of the younger men to
devote themselves to hard work.  But the assumption is not always
correct; there are still many competent colored mechanics in the South.
In the town of which I have spoken, for instance, colored men are still
the barbers, blacksmiths, masons and carpenters.  And while there
has been such a falling off, partly due to the unsettled conditions
resulting from emancipation and inseparable from so sudden and radical
a change, another reason for it exists in the altered industrial
conditions which confront mechanics all over the country, due mainly to the
growth of manufactures and the increased ease and cheapness of
transportation.  The shoes which were formerly made by hand are now
manufactured in Massachusetts and sold, with a portrait of the maker
stamped upon the sole, for less money than the most poorly paid
mechanic could afford to make them for by hand.  The buggies and
wagons, to produce which kept a large factory, in the town where I lived,
in constant operation, are now made in Cincinnati and other Northern
cities, and delivered in North Carolina for a price prohibitive of
manufacture by hand.  Furniture is made at Grand Rapids, coffins in one
place, and clothing in still another.  The blacksmith buys his
horseshoe ready made, in assorted sizes, and has merely to trim the hoof
and fasten them on with machine-made nails.  The shoemaker has
degenerated into the cobbler; the tinner merely keeps a shop for the
sale of tinware; the undertaker merely embalms the dead and
conducts funerals, and tombstones are sold by catalogue with blanks for
the insertion of names and dates before delivery.  In some of the new
industries which have sprung up in the South, such, for instance, as
cotton-milling, Negroes are not employed.  Hence, in large part
through the operation of social forces beyond any control on their
part, they have lost their hereditary employments, and these have
only in part been replaced by employment in tobacco factories and in
iron mines and mills.
</p><p>     The general decline of the apprenticeship system which has
affected black and white alike, is also in some degree responsible for the
dearth of trained mechanics in the South.  Even in Northern cities
the finer grades of stone-cutting, bricklaying, carpentry and cabinet
work, and practically all the mosaic and terra-cotta work and fine
   <pb n="141"/>
interior decorating, is done by workmen of foreign birth and training.
</p><p>     Many of the younger colored people who might have learned trades,
have found worthy employment as teachers and preachers; but the
servile occupations into which so many of the remainder have drifted by
following the line of least resistance, are a poor substitute for the
independent position of the skilled mechanic.  The establishment, for the
colored race, of such institutions as Hampton and Tuskegee, not only
replaces the apprenticeship system, but fills a growing industrial want.
A multiplication of such agencies will enable the "free colored people"
of the next generation, who now embrace the whole race and will
number some ten millions or more, to regain these lost arts, and through
them, by industry and thrift, under intelligent leadership, to win that
equality of citizenship of which they are now grasping, perhaps,
somewhat more than the shadow but something less than the substance.
