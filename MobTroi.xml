<head>Prologue</head>

<p>
In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece<lb/>
The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,<lb/>
Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,<lb/>
Fraught with the ministers and instruments<lb/>
Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore<lb/>
Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay<lb/>
Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made<lb/>
To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures<lb/>
The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,<lb/>
With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel.<lb/>
To Tenedos they come;<lb/>
And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge<lb/>
Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains<lb/>
The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch<lb/>
Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,<lb/>
Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,<lb/>
And Antenorides, with massy staples<lb/>
And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,<lb/>
Sperr up the sons of Troy.<lb/>
Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,<lb/>
On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,<lb/>
Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come<lb/>
A prologue arm'd, but not in confidence<lb/>
Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited<lb/>
In like conditions as our argument,<lb/>
To tell you, fair beholders, that our play<lb/>
Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,<lb/>
Beginning in the middle, starting thence away<lb/>
To what may be digested in a play.<lb/>
Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:<lb/>
Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.<lb/>

<p><stage>Troy. Before Priam's palace.</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter TROILUS armed, and PANDARUS</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:<lb/>
Why should I war without the walls of Troy,<lb/>
That find such cruel battle here within?<lb/>
Each Trojan that is master of his heart,<lb/>
Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Will this gear ne'er be mended?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,<lb/>
Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;<lb/>
But I am weaker than a woman's tear,<lb/>
Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,<lb/>
Less valiant than the virgin in the night<lb/>
And skilless as unpractised infancy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,<lb/>
I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will<lb/>
have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Have I not tarried?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry<lb/>
the bolting.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Have I not tarried?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Still have I tarried.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word<lb/>
'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the<lb/>
heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must<lb/>
stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,<lb/>
Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.<lb/>
At Priam's royal table do I sit;<lb/>
And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,&mdash;<lb/>
So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw<lb/>
her look, or any woman else.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>I was about to tell thee:&mdash;when my heart,<lb/>
As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,<lb/>
Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,<lb/>
I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,<lb/>
Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:<lb/>
But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,<lb/>
Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's&mdash;<lb/>
well, go to&mdash;there were no more comparison between<lb/>
the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I<lb/>
would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would<lb/>
somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I<lb/>
will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,&mdash;<lb/>
When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,<lb/>
Reply not in how many fathoms deep<lb/>
They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad<lb/>
In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'<lb/>
Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart<lb/>
Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,<lb/>
Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,<lb/>
In whose comparison all whites are ink,<lb/>
Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure<lb/>
The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense<lb/>
Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,<lb/>
As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;<lb/>
But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,<lb/>
Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me<lb/>
The knife that made it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>I speak no more than truth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Thou dost not speak so much.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:<lb/>
if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be<lb/>
not, she has the mends in her own hands.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of<lb/>
her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and<lb/>
between, but small thanks for my labour.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair<lb/>
as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as<lb/>
fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care<lb/>
I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Say I she is not fair?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to<lb/>
stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so<lb/>
I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,<lb/>
I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Pandarus,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Not I.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Sweet Pandarus,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I<lb/>
found it, and there an end.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit PANDARUS. An alarum</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!<lb/>
Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,<lb/>
When with your blood you daily paint her thus.<lb/>
I cannot fight upon this argument;<lb/>
It is too starved a subject for my sword.<lb/>
But Pandarus,&mdash;O gods, how do you plague me!<lb/>
I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;<lb/>
And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.<lb/>
As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.<lb/>
Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,<lb/>
What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?<lb/>
Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:<lb/>
Between our Ilium and where she resides,<lb/>
Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,<lb/>
Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar<lb/>
Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Alarum. Enter AENEAS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Because not there: this woman's answer sorts,<lb/>
For womanish it is to be from thence.<lb/>
What news, AEneas, from the field to-day?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>That Paris is returned home and hurt.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>By whom, AEneas?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>Troilus, by Menelaus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;<lb/>
Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Alarum</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'<lb/>
But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>In all swift haste.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Come, go we then together.<lb/>

</p></sp><p><stage>Exeunt</stage>



</p></div2><div2 type="scene" n="2" id="d8">
<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>The Same. A street.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDER</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Who were those went by?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXANDER</speaker>
<p>Queen Hecuba and Helen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>And whither go they?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXANDER</speaker>
<p>Up to the eastern tower,<lb/>
Whose height commands as subject all the vale,<lb/>
To see the battle. Hector, whose patience<lb/>
Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:<lb/>
He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,<lb/>
And, like as there were husbandry in war,<lb/>
Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,<lb/>
And to the field goes he; where every flower<lb/>
Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw<lb/>
In Hector's wrath.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>What was his cause of anger?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXANDER</speaker>
<p>The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks<lb/>
A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;<lb/>
They call him Ajax.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Good; and what of him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXANDER</speaker>
<p>They say he is a very man per se,<lb/>
And stands alone.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXANDER</speaker>
<p>This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their<lb/>
particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,<lb/>
churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man<lb/>
into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his<lb/>
valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with<lb/>
discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he<lb/>
hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he<lb/>
carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without<lb/>
cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the<lb/>
joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint<lb/>
that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,<lb/>
or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>But how should this man, that makes<lb/>
me smile, make Hector angry?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXANDER</speaker>
<p>They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and<lb/>
struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath<lb/>
ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Who comes here?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXANDER</speaker>
<p>Madam, your uncle Pandarus.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter PANDARUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Hector's a gallant man.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALEXANDER</speaker>
<p>As may be in the world, lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>What's that? what's that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?<lb/>
Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When<lb/>
were you at Ilium?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>This morning, uncle.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector<lb/>
armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not<lb/>
up, was she?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Even so: Hector was stirring early.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>That were we talking of, and of his anger.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Was he angry?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>So he says here.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>True, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll lay<lb/>
about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there's<lb/>
Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take<lb/>
heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>What, is he angry too?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>O Jupiter! there's no comparison.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a<lb/>
man if you see him?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>So he is.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>He is not Hector.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were<lb/>
himself! Well, the gods are above; time must friend<lb/>
or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were<lb/>
in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Excuse me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>He is elder.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Pardon me, pardon me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another<lb/>
tale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not<lb/>
have his wit this year.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>He shall not need it, if he have his own.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Nor his qualities.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>No matter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Nor his beauty.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>'Twould not become him; his own's better.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>You have no judgment, niece: Helen<lb/>
herself swore th' other day, that Troilus, for<lb/>
a brown favour&mdash;for so 'tis, I must confess,&mdash;<lb/>
not brown neither,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>No, but brown.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>To say the truth, true and not true.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>She praised his complexion above Paris.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Why, Paris hath colour enough.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>So he has.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised<lb/>
him above, his complexion is higher than his; he<lb/>
having colour enough, and the other higher, is too<lb/>
flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as<lb/>
lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for<lb/>
a copper nose.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Then she's a merry Greek indeed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other<lb/>
day into the compassed window,&mdash;and, you know, he<lb/>
has not past three or four hairs on his chin,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his<lb/>
particulars therein to a total.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within<lb/>
three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came<lb/>
and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Why, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smiling<lb/>
becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>O, he smiles valiantly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Does he not?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helen<lb/>
loves Troilus,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll<lb/>
prove it so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteem<lb/>
an addle egg.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle<lb/>
head, you would eat chickens i' the shell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickled<lb/>
his chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I<lb/>
must needs confess,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Without the rack.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed<lb/>
that her eyes ran o'er.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>With mill-stones.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>And Cassandra laughed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>But there was more temperate fire under the pot of<lb/>
her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>And Hector laughed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>At what was all this laughing?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed<lb/>
too.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>What was his answer?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your<lb/>
chin, and one of them is white.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>This is her question.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and<lb/>
fifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that white<lb/>
hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.'<lb/>
'Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris,<lb/>
my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck't<lb/>
out, and give it him.' But there was such laughing!<lb/>
and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the<lb/>
rest so laughed, that it passed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>So let it now; for it has been while going by.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>So I do.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, an 'twere<lb/>
a man born in April.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle<lb/>
against May.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>A retreat sounded</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Hark! they are coming from the field: shall we<lb/>
stand up here, and see them as they pass toward<lb/>
Ilium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>At your pleasure.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may<lb/>
see most bravely: I'll tell you them all by their<lb/>
names as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Speak not so loud.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>AENEAS passes</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>That's AEneas: is not that a brave man? he's one of<lb/>
the flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but mark<lb/>
Troilus; you shall see anon.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>ANTENOR passes</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Who's that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you;<lb/>
and he's a man good enough, he's one o' the soundest<lb/>
judgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person.<lb/>
When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: if<lb/>
he see me, you shall see him nod at me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Will he give you the nod?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>You shall see.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>If he do, the rich shall have more.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>HECTOR passes</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's a<lb/>
fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man,<lb/>
niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's<lb/>
a countenance! is't not a brave man?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>O, a brave man!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Is a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look you<lb/>
what hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, do<lb/>
you see? look you there: there's no jesting;<lb/>
there's laying on, take't off who will, as they say:<lb/>
there be hacks!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Be those with swords?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Swords! any thing, he cares not; an the devil come<lb/>
to him, it's all one: by God's lid, it does one's<lb/>
heart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>PARIS passes</stage></p>


<p>
Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too,<lb/>
is't not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he came<lb/>
hurt home to-day? he's not hurt: why, this will do<lb/>
Helen's heart good now, ha! Would I could see<lb/>
Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>HELENUS passes</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Who's that?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's<lb/>
Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Can Helenus fight, uncle?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Helenus? no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I<lb/>
marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the<lb/>
people cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>What sneaking fellow comes yonder?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>TROILUS passes</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Where? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!<lb/>
there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! the<lb/>
prince of chivalry!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Peace, for shame, peace!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon<lb/>
him, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, and<lb/>
his helm more hacked than Hector's, and how he looks,<lb/>
and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er saw<lb/>
three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way!<lb/>
Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess,<lb/>
he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?<lb/>
Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to<lb/>
change, would give an eye to boot.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Here come more.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Forces pass</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!<lb/>
porridge after meat! I could live and die i' the<lb/>
eyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eagles<lb/>
are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had<lb/>
rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and<lb/>
all Greece.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Achilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Well, well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>'Well, well!' why, have you any discretion? have<lb/>
you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not<lb/>
birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,<lb/>
learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality,<lb/>
and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with no date<lb/>
in the pie, for then the man's date's out.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>You are such a woman! one knows not at what ward you<lb/>
lie.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to<lb/>
defend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine<lb/>
honesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, to<lb/>
defend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at a<lb/>
thousand watches.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Say one of your watches.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the<lb/>
chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would<lb/>
not have hit, I can watch you for telling how I took<lb/>
the blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it's<lb/>
past watching.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>You are such another!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter Troilus's Boy</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boy</speaker>
<p>Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Where?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boy</speaker>
<p>At your own house; there he unarms him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Good boy, tell him I come.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit boy</stage></p>


<p>
I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Adieu, uncle.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>I'll be with you, niece, by and by.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>To bring, uncle?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, a token from Troilus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>By the same token, you are a bawd.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit PANDARUS</stage></p>


<p>
Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,<lb/>
He offers in another's enterprise;<lb/>
But more in Troilus thousand fold I see<lb/>
Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;<lb/>
Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:<lb/>
Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.<lb/>
That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:<lb/>
Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:<lb/>
That she was never yet that ever knew<lb/>
Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.<lb/>
Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:<lb/>
Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech:<lb/>
Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,<lb/>
Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.<lb/>

<p><stage>The Grecian camp. Before Agamemnon's tent.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Sennet. Enter AGAMEMNON, NESTOR, ULYSSES,	MENELAUS, and others</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>Princes,<lb/>
What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?<lb/>
The ample proposition that hope makes<lb/>
In all designs begun on earth below<lb/>
Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters<lb/>
Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,<lb/>
As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,<lb/>
Infect the sound pine and divert his grain<lb/>
Tortive and errant from his course of growth.<lb/>
Nor, princes, is it matter new to us<lb/>
That we come short of our suppose so far<lb/>
That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;<lb/>
Sith every action that hath gone before,<lb/>
Whereof we have record, trial did draw<lb/>
Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,<lb/>
And that unbodied figure of the thought<lb/>
That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,<lb/>
Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,<lb/>
And call them shames? which are indeed nought else<lb/>
But the protractive trials of great Jove<lb/>
To find persistive constancy in men:<lb/>
The fineness of which metal is not found<lb/>
In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,<lb/>
The wise and fool, the artist and unread,<lb/>
The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:<lb/>
But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,<lb/>
Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,<lb/>
Puffing at all, winnows the light away;<lb/>
And what hath mass or matter, by itself<lb/>
Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>With due observance of thy godlike seat,<lb/>
Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply<lb/>
Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance<lb/>
Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,<lb/>
How many shallow bauble boats dare sail<lb/>
Upon her patient breast, making their way<lb/>
With those of nobler bulk!<lb/>
But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage<lb/>
The gentle Thetis, and anon behold<lb/>
The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,<lb/>
Bounding between the two moist elements,<lb/>
Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat<lb/>
Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now<lb/>
Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,<lb/>
Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so<lb/>
Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide<lb/>
In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness<lb/>
The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze<lb/>
Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind<lb/>
Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,<lb/>
And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage<lb/>
As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,<lb/>
And with an accent tuned in selfsame key<lb/>
Retorts to chiding fortune.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Agamemnon,<lb/>
Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,<lb/>
Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit.<lb/>
In whom the tempers and the minds of all<lb/>
Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.<lb/>
Besides the applause and approbation To which,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To AGAMEMNON</stage></p>


<p>
most mighty for thy place and sway,<lb/>


</p><p><stage>To NESTOR</stage></p>


<p>
And thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out life<lb/>
I give to both your speeches, which were such<lb/>
As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece<lb/>
Should hold up high in brass, and such again<lb/>
As venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver,<lb/>
Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree<lb/>
On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears<lb/>
To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,<lb/>
Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>Speak, prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect<lb/>
That matter needless, of importless burden,<lb/>
Divide thy lips, than we are confident,<lb/>
When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,<lb/>
We shall hear music, wit and oracle.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,<lb/>
And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,<lb/>
But for these instances.<lb/>
The specialty of rule hath been neglected:<lb/>
And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand<lb/>
Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.<lb/>
When that the general is not like the hive<lb/>
To whom the foragers shall all repair,<lb/>
What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,<lb/>
The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.<lb/>
The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre<lb/>
Observe degree, priority and place,<lb/>
Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,<lb/>
Office and custom, in all line of order;<lb/>
And therefore is the glorious planet Sol<lb/>
In noble eminence enthroned and sphered<lb/>
Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye<lb/>
Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,<lb/>
And posts, like the commandment of a king,<lb/>
Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets<lb/>
In evil mixture to disorder wander,<lb/>
What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!<lb/>
What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!<lb/>
Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,<lb/>
Divert and crack, rend and deracinate<lb/>
The unity and married calm of states<lb/>
Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,<lb/>
Which is the ladder to all high designs,<lb/>
Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,<lb/>
Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,<lb/>
Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,<lb/>
The primogenitive and due of birth,<lb/>
Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,<lb/>
But by degree, stand in authentic place?<lb/>
Take but degree away, untune that string,<lb/>
And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets<lb/>
In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters<lb/>
Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores<lb/>
And make a sop of all this solid globe:<lb/>
Strength should be lord of imbecility,<lb/>
And the rude son should strike his father dead:<lb/>
Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,<lb/>
Between whose endless jar justice resides,<lb/>
Should lose their names, and so should justice too.<lb/>
Then every thing includes itself in power,<lb/>
Power into will, will into appetite;<lb/>
And appetite, an universal wolf,<lb/>
So doubly seconded with will and power,<lb/>
Must make perforce an universal prey,<lb/>
And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,<lb/>
This chaos, when degree is suffocate,<lb/>
Follows the choking.<lb/>
And this neglection of degree it is<lb/>
That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose<lb/>
It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd<lb/>
By him one step below, he by the next,<lb/>
That next by him beneath; so every step,<lb/>
Exampled by the first pace that is sick<lb/>
Of his superior, grows to an envious fever<lb/>
Of pale and bloodless emulation:<lb/>
And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,<lb/>
Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,<lb/>
Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd<lb/>
The fever whereof all our power is sick.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,<lb/>
What is the remedy?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns<lb/>
The sinew and the forehand of our host,<lb/>
Having his ear full of his airy fame,<lb/>
Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent<lb/>
Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus<lb/>
Upon a lazy bed the livelong day<lb/>
Breaks scurril jests;<lb/>
And with ridiculous and awkward action,<lb/>
Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,<lb/>
He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,<lb/>
Thy topless deputation he puts on,<lb/>
And, like a strutting player, whose conceit<lb/>
Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich<lb/>
To hear the wooden dialogue and sound<lb/>
'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,&mdash;<lb/>
Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming<lb/>
He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,<lb/>
'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,<lb/>
Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd<lb/>
Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff<lb/>
The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,<lb/>
From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;<lb/>
Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.<lb/>
Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,<lb/>
As he being drest to some oration.'<lb/>
That's done, as near as the extremest ends<lb/>
Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:<lb/>
Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!<lb/>
'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,<lb/>
Arming to answer in a night alarm.'<lb/>
And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age<lb/>
Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,<lb/>
And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,<lb/>
Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport<lb/>
Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;<lb/>
Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all<lb/>
In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,<lb/>
All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,<lb/>
Severals and generals of grace exact,<lb/>
Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,<lb/>
Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,<lb/>
Success or loss, what is or is not, serves<lb/>
As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>And in the imitation of these twain&mdash;<lb/>
Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns<lb/>
With an imperial voice&mdash;many are infect.<lb/>
Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his head<lb/>
In such a rein, in full as proud a place<lb/>
As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;<lb/>
Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,<lb/>
Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,<lb/>
A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,<lb/>
To match us in comparisons with dirt,<lb/>
To weaken and discredit our exposure,<lb/>
How rank soever rounded in with danger.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,<lb/>
Count wisdom as no member of the war,<lb/>
Forestall prescience, and esteem no act<lb/>
But that of hand: the still and mental parts,<lb/>
That do contrive how many hands shall strike,<lb/>
When fitness calls them on, and know by measure<lb/>
Of their observant toil the enemies' weight,&mdash;<lb/>
Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:<lb/>
They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war;<lb/>
So that the ram that batters down the wall,<lb/>
For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,<lb/>
They place before his hand that made the engine,<lb/>
Or those that with the fineness of their souls<lb/>
By reason guide his execution.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse<lb/>
Makes many Thetis' sons.<lb/>

<p>Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>Even this.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>May one, that is a herald and a prince,<lb/>
Do a fair message to his kingly ears?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>With surety stronger than Achilles' arm<lb/>
'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice<lb/>
Call Agamemnon head and general.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>Fair leave and large security. How may<lb/>
A stranger to those most imperial looks<lb/>
Know them from eyes of other mortals?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>How!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>Ay;<lb/>
I ask, that I might waken reverence,<lb/>
And bid the cheek be ready with a blush<lb/>
Modest as morning when she coldly eyes<lb/>
The youthful Phoebus:<lb/>
Which is that god in office, guiding men?<lb/>
Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy<lb/>
Are ceremonious courtiers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,<lb/>
As bending angels; that's their fame in peace:<lb/>
But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,<lb/>
Good arms, strong joints, true swords; and,<lb/>
Jove's accord,<lb/>
Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas,<lb/>
Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!<lb/>
The worthiness of praise distains his worth,<lb/>
If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:<lb/>
But what the repining enemy commends,<lb/>
That breath fame blows; that praise, sole sure,<lb/>
transcends.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>Ay, Greek, that is my name.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>What's your affair I pray you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him:<lb/>
I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,<lb/>
To set his sense on the attentive bent,<lb/>
And then to speak.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>Speak frankly as the wind;<lb/>
It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:<lb/>
That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,<lb/>
He tells thee so himself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>Trumpet, blow loud,<lb/>
Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;<lb/>
And every Greek of mettle, let him know,<lb/>
What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Trumpet sounds</stage></p>


<p>
We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy<lb/>
A prince call'd Hector,&mdash;Priam is his father,&mdash;<lb/>
Who in this dull and long-continued truce<lb/>
Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,<lb/>
And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!<lb/>
If there be one among the fair'st of Greece<lb/>
That holds his honour higher than his ease,<lb/>
That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,<lb/>
That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,<lb/>
That loves his mistress more than in confession,<lb/>
With truant vows to her own lips he loves,<lb/>
And dare avow her beauty and her worth<lb/>
In other arms than hers,&mdash;to him this challenge.<lb/>
Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,<lb/>
Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,<lb/>
He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,<lb/>
Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,<lb/>
And will to-morrow with his trumpet call<lb/>
Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,<lb/>
To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:<lb/>
If any come, Hector shall honour him;<lb/>
If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,<lb/>
The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth<lb/>
The splinter of a lance. Even so much.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>This shall be told our lovers, Lord AEneas;<lb/>
If none of them have soul in such a kind,<lb/>
We left them all at home: but we are soldiers;<lb/>
And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,<lb/>
That means not, hath not, or is not in love!<lb/>
If then one is, or hath, or means to be,<lb/>
That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man<lb/>
When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now;<lb/>
But if there be not in our Grecian host<lb/>
One noble man that hath one spark of fire,<lb/>
To answer for his love, tell him from me<lb/>
I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver<lb/>
And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,<lb/>
And meeting him will tell him that my lady<lb/>
Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste<lb/>
As may be in the world: his youth in flood,<lb/>
I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Amen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>Fair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand;<lb/>
To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.<lb/>
Achilles shall have word of this intent;<lb/>
So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:<lb/>
Yourself shall feast with us before you go<lb/>
And find the welcome of a noble foe.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all but ULYSSES and NESTOR</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Nestor!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>What says Ulysses?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>I have a young conception in my brain;<lb/>
Be you my time to bring it to some shape.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>What is't?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>This 'tis:<lb/>
Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride<lb/>
That hath to this maturity blown up<lb/>
In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,<lb/>
Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,<lb/>
To overbulk us all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>Well, and how?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,<lb/>
However it is spread in general name,<lb/>
Relates in purpose only to Achilles.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,<lb/>
Whose grossness little characters sum up:<lb/>
And, in the publication, make no strain,<lb/>
But that Achilles, were his brain as barren<lb/>
As banks of Libya,&mdash;though, Apollo knows,<lb/>
'Tis dry enough,&mdash;will, with great speed of judgment,<lb/>
Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose<lb/>
Pointing on him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>And wake him to the answer, think you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,<lb/>
That can from Hector bring his honour off,<lb/>
If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,<lb/>
Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;<lb/>
For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute<lb/>
With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,<lb/>
Our imputation shall be oddly poised<lb/>
In this wild action; for the success,<lb/>
Although particular, shall give a scantling<lb/>
Of good or bad unto the general;<lb/>
And in such indexes, although small pricks<lb/>
To their subsequent volumes, there is seen<lb/>
The baby figure of the giant mass<lb/>
Of things to come at large. It is supposed<lb/>
He that meets Hector issues from our choice<lb/>
And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,<lb/>
Makes merit her election, and doth boil,<lb/>
As 'twere from us all, a man distill'd<lb/>
Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,<lb/>
What heart receives from hence the conquering part,<lb/>
To steel a strong opinion to themselves?<lb/>
Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,<lb/>
In no less working than are swords and bows<lb/>
Directive by the limbs.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Give pardon to my speech:<lb/>
Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.<lb/>
Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,<lb/>
And think, perchance, they'll sell; if not,<lb/>
The lustre of the better yet to show,<lb/>
Shall show the better. Do not consent<lb/>
That ever Hector and Achilles meet;<lb/>
For both our honour and our shame in this<lb/>
Are dogg'd with two strange followers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>I see them not with my old eyes: what are they?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,<lb/>
Were he not proud, we all should share with him:<lb/>
But he already is too insolent;<lb/>
And we were better parch in Afric sun<lb/>
Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,<lb/>
Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,<lb/>
Why then, we did our main opinion crush<lb/>
In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;<lb/>
And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw<lb/>
The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves<lb/>
Give him allowance for the better man;<lb/>
For that will physic the great Myrmidon<lb/>
Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall<lb/>
His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.<lb/>
If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,<lb/>
We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,<lb/>
Yet go we under our opinion still<lb/>
That we have better men. But, hit or miss,<lb/>
Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:<lb/>
Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>Ulysses,<lb/>
Now I begin to relish thy advice;<lb/>
And I will give a taste of it forthwith<lb/>
To Agamemnon: go we to him straight.<lb/>
Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone<lb/>
Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.<lb/>

generally?<lb/>

<p>Thou bitch-wolf's son, canst thou not hear?<lb/>

<p>
Feel, then.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel<lb/>
beef-witted lord!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>Speak then, thou vinewedst leaven, speak: I will<lb/>
beat thee into handsomeness.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness: but,<lb/>
I think, thy horse will sooner con an oration than<lb/>
thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike,<lb/>
canst thou? a red murrain o' thy jade's tricks!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest me thus?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>The proclamation!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Thou art proclaimed a fool, I think.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>Do not, porpentine, do not: my fingers itch.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had<lb/>
the scratching of thee; I would make thee the<lb/>
loathsomest scab in Greece. When thou art forth in<lb/>
the incursions, thou strikest as slow as another.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>I say, the proclamation!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles,<lb/>

Cerberus is at Proserpine's beauty, ay, that thou<lb/>

<p>Cobloaf!<lb/>

<p>Ay, do, do; thou sodden-witted lord! thou hast no<lb/>
more brain than I have in mine elbows; an assinego<lb/>
may tutor thee: thou scurvy-valiant ass! thou art<lb/>
here but to thrash Trojans; and thou art bought and<lb/>
sold among those of any wit, like a barbarian slave.<lb/>
If thou use to beat me, I will begin at thy heel, and<lb/>
tell what thou art by inches, thou thing of no<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Why, how now, Ajax! wherefore do you thus? How now,<lb/>
Thersites! what's the matter, man?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>You see him there, do you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Ay; what's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Nay, look upon him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>So I do: what's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Nay, but regard him well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>'Well!' why, I do so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>But yet you look not well upon him; for whosoever you<lb/>
take him to be, he is Ajax.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>I know that, fool.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Ay, but that fool knows not himself.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>Therefore I beat thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! his<lb/>
evasions have ears thus long. I have bobbed his<lb/>
brain more than he has beat my bones: I will buy<lb/>
nine sparrows for a penny, and his pia mater is not<lb/>
worth the nineth part of a sparrow. This lord,<lb/>
Achilles, Ajax, who wears his wit in his belly and<lb/>
his guts in his head, I'll tell you what I say of<lb/>
him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>What?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>I say, this Ajax&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Nay, good Ajax.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Nay, I must hold you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>As will stop the eye of Helen's needle, for whom he<lb/>
comes to fight.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Peace, fool!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>I would have peace and quietness, but the fool will<lb/>
not: he there: that he: look you there.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>O thou damned cur! I shall&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Will you set your wit to a fool's?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>No, I warrant you; for a fools will shame it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>Good words, Thersites.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>What's the quarrel?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the<lb/>
proclamation, and he rails upon me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>I serve thee not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>Well, go to, go to.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>I serve here voluntarily.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Your last service was sufferance, 'twas not<lb/>
voluntary: no man is beaten voluntary: Ajax was<lb/>
here the voluntary, and you as under an impress.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>E'en so; a great deal of your wit, too, lies in your<lb/>
sinews, or else there be liars. Hector have a great<lb/>
catch, if he knock out either of your brains: a'<lb/>
were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>What, with me too, Thersites?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>There's Ulysses and old Nestor, whose wit was mouldy<lb/>
ere your grandsires had nails on their toes, yoke you<lb/>
like draught-oxen and make you plough up the wars.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>What, what?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Yes, good sooth: to, Achilles! to, Ajax! to!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>I shall cut out your tongue.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>'Tis no matter! I shall speak as much as thou<lb/>
afterwards.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>No more words, Thersites; peace!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>I will hold my peace when Achilles' brach bids me, shall I?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>There's for you, Patroclus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>I will see you hanged, like clotpoles, ere I come<lb/>
any more to your tents: I will keep where there is<lb/>
wit stirring and leave the faction of fools.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>A good riddance.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Marry, this, sir, is proclaim'd through all our host:<lb/>
That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun,<lb/>
Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy<lb/>
To-morrow morning call some knight to arms<lb/>
That hath a stomach; and such a one that dare<lb/>
Maintain&mdash;I know not what: 'tis trash. Farewell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>Farewell. Who shall answer him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>I know not: 'tis put to lottery; otherwise<lb/>
He knew his man.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>O, meaning you. I will go learn more of it.<lb/>

<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>Troy. A room in Priam's palace.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter PRIAM, HECTOR, TROILUS, PARIS, and HELENUS</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>PRIAM</speaker>
<p>After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,<lb/>
Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:<lb/>
'Deliver Helen, and all damage else&mdash;<lb/>
As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,<lb/>
Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed<lb/>
In hot digestion of this cormorant war&mdash;<lb/>
Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I<lb/>
As far as toucheth my particular,<lb/>
Yet, dread Priam,<lb/>
There is no lady of more softer bowels,<lb/>
More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,<lb/>
More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'<lb/>
Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,<lb/>
Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd<lb/>
The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches<lb/>
To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:<lb/>
Since the first sword was drawn about this question,<lb/>
Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,<lb/>
Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:<lb/>
If we have lost so many tenths of ours,<lb/>
To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,<lb/>
Had it our name, the value of one ten,<lb/>
What merit's in that reason which denies<lb/>
The yielding of her up?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Fie, fie, my brother!<lb/>
Weigh you the worth and honour of a king<lb/>
So great as our dread father in a scale<lb/>
Of common ounces? will you with counters sum<lb/>
The past proportion of his infinite?<lb/>
And buckle in a waist most fathomless<lb/>
With spans and inches so diminutive<lb/>
As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELENUS</speaker>
<p>No marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons,<lb/>
You are so empty of them. Should not our father<lb/>
Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,<lb/>
Because your speech hath none that tells him so?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;<lb/>
You fur your gloves with reason. Here are<lb/>
your reasons:<lb/>
You know an enemy intends you harm;<lb/>
You know a sword employ'd is perilous,<lb/>
And reason flies the object of all harm:<lb/>
Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds<lb/>
A Grecian and his sword, if he do set<lb/>
The very wings of reason to his heels<lb/>
And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,<lb/>
Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,<lb/>
Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour<lb/>
Should have hare-hearts, would they but fat<lb/>
their thoughts<lb/>
With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect<lb/>
Make livers pale and lustihood deject.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost<lb/>
The holding.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>What is aught, but as 'tis valued?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>But value dwells not in particular will;<lb/>
It holds his estimate and dignity<lb/>
As well wherein 'tis precious of itself<lb/>
As in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatry<lb/>
To make the service greater than the god<lb/>
And the will dotes that is attributive<lb/>
To what infectiously itself affects,<lb/>
Without some image of the affected merit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>I take to-day a wife, and my election<lb/>
Is led on in the conduct of my will;<lb/>
My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,<lb/>
Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores<lb/>
Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,<lb/>
Although my will distaste what it elected,<lb/>
The wife I chose? there can be no evasion<lb/>
To blench from this and to stand firm by honour:<lb/>
We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,<lb/>
When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viands<lb/>
We do not throw in unrespective sieve,<lb/>
Because we now are full. It was thought meet<lb/>
Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:<lb/>
Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;<lb/>
The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce<lb/>
And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,<lb/>
And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,<lb/>
He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness<lb/>
Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.<lb/>
Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:<lb/>
Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,<lb/>
Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,<lb/>
And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.<lb/>
If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went&mdash;<lb/>
As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'&mdash;<lb/>
If you'll confess he brought home noble prize&mdash;<lb/>
As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands<lb/>
And cried 'Inestimable!'&mdash;why do you now<lb/>
The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,<lb/>
And do a deed that fortune never did,<lb/>
Beggar the estimation which you prized<lb/>
Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,<lb/>
That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!<lb/>
But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n,<lb/>
That in their country did them that disgrace,<lb/>
We fear to warrant in our native place!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSANDRA</speaker>
<p><stage>[Within]</stage></p><p>  Cry, Trojans!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>It is Cassandra.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter CASSANDRA, raving</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSANDRA</speaker>
<p>Cry, Trojans, cry! lend me ten thousand eyes,<lb/>
And I will fill them with prophetic tears.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>Peace, sister, peace!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CASSANDRA</speaker>
<p>Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,<lb/>
Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,<lb/>
Add to my clamours! let us pay betimes<lb/>
A moiety of that mass of moan to come.<lb/>
Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!<lb/>
Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;<lb/>
Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.<lb/>
Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe:<lb/>
Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains<lb/>
Of divination in our sister work<lb/>
Some touches of remorse? or is your blood<lb/>
So madly hot that no discourse of reason,<lb/>
Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,<lb/>
Can qualify the same?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Why, brother Hector,<lb/>
We may not think the justness of each act<lb/>
Such and no other than event doth form it,<lb/>
Nor once deject the courage of our minds,<lb/>
Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick raptures<lb/>
Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel<lb/>
Which hath our several honours all engaged<lb/>
To make it gracious. For my private part,<lb/>
I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons:<lb/>
And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us<lb/>
Such things as might offend the weakest spleen<lb/>
To fight for and maintain!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>Else might the world convince of levity<lb/>
As well my undertakings as your counsels:<lb/>
But I attest the gods, your full consent<lb/>
Gave wings to my propension and cut off<lb/>
All fears attending on so dire a project.<lb/>
For what, alas, can these my single arms?<lb/>
What Propugnation is in one man's valour,<lb/>
To stand the push and enmity of those<lb/>
This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,<lb/>
Were I alone to pass the difficulties<lb/>
And had as ample power as I have will,<lb/>
Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,<lb/>
Nor faint in the pursuit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PRIAM</speaker>
<p>Paris, you speak<lb/>
Like one besotted on your sweet delights:<lb/>
You have the honey still, but these the gall;<lb/>
So to be valiant is no praise at all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>Sir, I propose not merely to myself<lb/>
The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;<lb/>
But I would have the soil of her fair rape<lb/>
Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.<lb/>
What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,<lb/>
Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,<lb/>
Now to deliver her possession up<lb/>
On terms of base compulsion! Can it be<lb/>
That so degenerate a strain as this<lb/>
Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?<lb/>
There's not the meanest spirit on our party<lb/>
Without a heart to dare or sword to draw<lb/>
When Helen is defended, nor none so noble<lb/>
Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed<lb/>
Where Helen is the subject; then, I say,<lb/>
Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,<lb/>
The world's large spaces cannot parallel.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,<lb/>
And on the cause and question now in hand<lb/>
Have glozed, but superficially: not much<lb/>
Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought<lb/>
Unfit to hear moral philosophy:<lb/>
The reasons you allege do more conduce<lb/>
To the hot passion of distemper'd blood<lb/>
Than to make up a free determination<lb/>
'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge<lb/>
Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice<lb/>
Of any true decision. Nature craves<lb/>
All dues be render'd to their owners: now,<lb/>
What nearer debt in all humanity<lb/>
Than wife is to the husband? If this law<lb/>
Of nature be corrupted through affection,<lb/>
And that great minds, of partial indulgence<lb/>
To their benumbed wills, resist the same,<lb/>
There is a law in each well-order'd nation<lb/>
To curb those raging appetites that are<lb/>
Most disobedient and refractory.<lb/>
If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,<lb/>
As it is known she is, these moral laws<lb/>
Of nature and of nations speak aloud<lb/>
To have her back return'd: thus to persist<lb/>
In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,<lb/>
But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion<lb/>
Is this in way of truth; yet ne'ertheless,<lb/>
My spritely brethren, I propend to you<lb/>
In resolution to keep Helen still,<lb/>
For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance<lb/>
Upon our joint and several dignities.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Why, there you touch'd the life of our design:<lb/>
Were it not glory that we more affected<lb/>
Than the performance of our heaving spleens,<lb/>
I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood<lb/>
Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,<lb/>
She is a theme of honour and renown,<lb/>
A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,<lb/>
Whose present courage may beat down our foes,<lb/>
And fame in time to come canonize us;<lb/>
For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose<lb/>
So rich advantage of a promised glory<lb/>
As smiles upon the forehead of this action<lb/>
For the wide world's revenue.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>I am yours,<lb/>
You valiant offspring of great Priamus.<lb/>
I have a roisting challenge sent amongst<lb/>
The dun and factious nobles of the Greeks<lb/>
Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:<lb/>
I was advertised their great general slept,<lb/>
Whilst emulation in the army crept:<lb/>
This, I presume, will wake him.<lb/>

<head>Scene 3</head>

<p><stage>The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter THERSITES, solus</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>How now, Thersites! what lost in the labyrinth of<lb/>
thy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He<lb/>
beats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction!<lb/>
would it were otherwise; that I could beat him,<lb/>
whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn to<lb/>
conjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue of<lb/>
my spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles, a<lb/>
rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two<lb/>
undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of<lb/>
themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,<lb/>
forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods and,<lb/>
Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy<lb/>
caduceus, if ye take not that little, little less<lb/>
than little wit from them that they have! which<lb/>
short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant<lb/>
scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly<lb/>
from a spider, without drawing their massy irons and<lb/>
cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the<lb/>
whole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that,<lb/>
methinks, is the curse dependent on those that war<lb/>
for a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envy<lb/>
say Amen. What ho! my Lord Achilles!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter PATROCLUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit, thou<lb/>
wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: but<lb/>
it is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The common<lb/>
curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in<lb/>
great revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor, and<lb/>
discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy<lb/>
direction till thy death! then if she that lays thee<lb/>
out says thou art a fair corse, I'll be sworn and<lb/>
sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars.<lb/>
Amen. Where's Achilles?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>What, art thou devout? wast thou in prayer?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Ay: the heavens hear me!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter ACHILLES</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Who's there?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>Thersites, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Where, where? Art thou come? why, my cheese, my<lb/>
digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to<lb/>
my table so many meals? Come, what's Agamemnon?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Thy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus,<lb/>
what's Achilles?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>Thy lord, Thersites: then tell me, I pray thee,<lb/>
what's thyself?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Thy knower, Patroclus: then tell me, Patroclus,<lb/>
what art thou?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>Thou mayst tell that knowest.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>O, tell, tell.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands<lb/>
Achilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus'<lb/>
knower, and Patroclus is a fool.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>You rascal!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Peace, fool! I have not done.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>He is a privileged man. Proceed, Thersites.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Agamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites<lb/>
is a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Derive this; come.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles;<lb/>
Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon;<lb/>
Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool, and<lb/>
Patroclus is a fool positive.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>Why am I a fool?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Make that demand of the prover. It suffices me thou<lb/>
art. Look you, who comes here?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Patroclus, I'll speak with nobody.<lb/>
Come in with me, Thersites.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Here is such patchery, such juggling and such<lb/>
knavery! all the argument is a cuckold and a<lb/>
whore; a good quarrel to draw emulous factions<lb/>
and bleed to death upon. Now, the dry serpigo on<lb/>
the subject! and war and lechery confound all!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, NESTOR, DIOMEDES, and AJAX</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>Where is Achilles?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>Within his tent; but ill disposed, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>Let it be known to him that we are here.<lb/>
He shent our messengers; and we lay by<lb/>
Our appertainments, visiting of him:<lb/>
Let him be told so; lest perchance he think<lb/>
We dare not move the question of our place,<lb/>
Or know not what we are.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>I shall say so to him.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>We saw him at the opening of his tent:<lb/>
He is not sick.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart: you may call it<lb/>
melancholy, if you will favour the man; but, by my<lb/>
head, 'tis pride: but why, why? let him show us the<lb/>
cause. A word, my lord.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Takes AGAMEMNON aside</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>Who, Thersites?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>He.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>No, you see, he is his argument that has his<lb/>
argument, Achilles.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>All the better; their fraction is more our wish than<lb/>
their faction: but it was a strong composure a fool<lb/>
could disunite.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily<lb/>
untie. Here comes Patroclus.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter PATROCLUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>No Achilles with him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy:<lb/>
his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>Achilles bids me say, he is much sorry,<lb/>
If any thing more than your sport and pleasure<lb/>
Did move your greatness and this noble state<lb/>
To call upon him; he hopes it is no other<lb/>
But for your health and your digestion sake,<lb/>
And after-dinner's breath.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>Hear you, Patroclus:<lb/>
We are too well acquainted with these answers:<lb/>
But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,<lb/>
Cannot outfly our apprehensions.<lb/>
Much attribute he hath, and much the reason<lb/>
Why we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues,<lb/>
Not virtuously on his own part beheld,<lb/>
Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,<lb/>
Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,<lb/>
Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,<lb/>
We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin,<lb/>
If you do say we think him over-proud<lb/>
And under-honest, in self-assumption greater<lb/>
Than in the note of judgment; and worthier<lb/>
than himself<lb/>
Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,<lb/>
Disguise the holy strength of their command,<lb/>
And underwrite in an observing kind<lb/>
His humorous predominance; yea, watch<lb/>
His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if<lb/>
The passage and whole carriage of this action<lb/>
Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,<lb/>
That if he overhold his price so much,<lb/>
We'll none of him; but let him, like an engine<lb/>
Not portable, lie under this report:<lb/>
'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:<lb/>
A stirring dwarf we do allowance give<lb/>
Before a sleeping giant.' Tell him so.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>I shall; and bring his answer presently.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>In second voice we'll not be satisfied;<lb/>
We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit ULYSSES</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>What is he more than another?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>No more than what he thinks he is.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a<lb/>
better man than I am?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>No question.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as<lb/>
wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether<lb/>
more tractable.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I<lb/>
know not what pride is.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the<lb/>
fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is<lb/>
his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle;<lb/>
and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devours<lb/>
the deed in the praise.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering of toads.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>Yet he loves himself: is't not strange?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Aside</stage>



</p><p><stage>Re-enter ULYSSES</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Achilles will not to the field to-morrow.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>What's his excuse?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>He doth rely on none,<lb/>
But carries on the stream of his dispose<lb/>
Without observance or respect of any,<lb/>
In will peculiar and in self-admission.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>Why will he not upon our fair request<lb/>
Untent his person and share the air with us?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Things small as nothing, for request's sake only,<lb/>
He makes important: possess'd he is with greatness,<lb/>
And speaks not to himself but with a pride<lb/>
That quarrels at self-breath: imagined worth<lb/>
Holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse<lb/>
That 'twixt his mental and his active parts<lb/>
Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages<lb/>
And batters down himself: what should I say?<lb/>
He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it<lb/>
Cry 'No recovery.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>Let Ajax go to him.<lb/>
Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:<lb/>
'Tis said he holds you well, and will be led<lb/>
At your request a little from himself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>O Agamemnon, let it not be so!<lb/>
We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes<lb/>
When they go from Achilles: shall the proud lord<lb/>
That bastes his arrogance with his own seam<lb/>
And never suffers matter of the world<lb/>
Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve<lb/>
And ruminate himself, shall he be worshipp'd<lb/>
Of that we hold an idol more than he?<lb/>
No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord<lb/>
Must not so stale his palm, nobly acquired;<lb/>
Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,<lb/>
As amply titled as Achilles is,<lb/>
By going to Achilles:<lb/>
That were to enlard his fat already pride<lb/>
And add more coals to Cancer when he burns<lb/>
With entertaining great Hyperion.<lb/>
This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,<lb/>
And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to DIOMEDES]</stage></p><p>  O, this is well; he rubs the<lb/>
vein of him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p><stage>[Aside to NESTOR]</stage></p><p>  And how his silence drinks up<lb/>
this applause!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the face.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>O, no, you shall not go.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>An a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride:<lb/>
Let me go to him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>A paltry, insolent fellow!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>How he describes himself!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>Can he not be sociable?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>The raven chides blackness.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>I'll let his humours blood.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>He will be the physician that should be the patient.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>An all men were o' my mind,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Wit would be out of fashion.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>A' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first:<lb/>
shall pride carry it?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>An 'twould, you'ld carry half.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>A' would have ten shares.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>I will knead him; I'll make him supple.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>He's not yet through warm: force him with praises:<lb/>
pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p><stage>[To AGAMEMNON]</stage></p><p>  My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>Our noble general, do not do so.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>You must prepare to fight without Achilles.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Why, 'tis this naming of him does him harm.<lb/>
Here is a man&mdash;but 'tis before his face;<lb/>
I will be silent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>Wherefore should you so?<lb/>
He is not emulous, as Achilles is.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Know the whole world, he is as valiant.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>A whoreson dog, that shall pelter thus with us!<lb/>
Would he were a Trojan!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>What a vice were it in Ajax now,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>If he were proud,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>Or covetous of praise,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Ay, or surly borne,&mdash;<lb/>

<p>Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure;<lb/>
Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck:<lb/>
Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature<lb/>
Thrice famed, beyond all erudition:<lb/>
But he that disciplined thy arms to fight,<lb/>
Let Mars divide eternity in twain,<lb/>
And give him half: and, for thy vigour,<lb/>
Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield<lb/>
To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,<lb/>
Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines<lb/>
Thy spacious and dilated parts: here's Nestor;<lb/>
Instructed by the antiquary times,<lb/>
He must, he is, he cannot but be wise:<lb/>
Put pardon, father Nestor, were your days<lb/>
As green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd,<lb/>
You should not have the eminence of him,<lb/>
But be as Ajax.<lb/>

<p>There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles<lb/>
Keeps thicket. Please it our great general<lb/>

Fresh kings are come to Troy: to-morrow<lb/>

And here's a lord,&mdash;come knights from east to west,<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter a Servant and PANDARUS</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Friend, you! pray you, a word: do not you follow<lb/>
the young Lord Paris?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Ay, sir, when he goes before me.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>You depend upon him, I mean?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Sir, I do depend upon the lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>You depend upon a noble gentleman; I must needs<lb/>
praise him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>The lord be praised!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>You know me, do you not?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Faith, sir, superficially.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Friend, know me better; I am the Lord Pandarus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>I hope I shall know your honour better.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>I do desire it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>You are in the state of grace.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Grace! not so, friend: honour and lordship are my titles.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Music within</stage></p>


<p>
What music is this?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>I do but partly know, sir: it is music in parts.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Know you the musicians?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Wholly, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Who play they to?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>To the hearers, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>At whose pleasure, friend<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Command, I mean, friend.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Who shall I command, sir?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Friend, we understand not one another: I am too<lb/>
courtly and thou art too cunning. At whose request<lb/>
do these men play?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>That's to 't indeed, sir: marry, sir, at the request<lb/>
of Paris my lord, who's there in person; with him,<lb/>
the mortal Venus, the heart-blood of beauty, love's<lb/>
invisible soul,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Who, my cousin Cressida?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>No, sir, Helen: could you not find out that by her<lb/>
attributes?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen the<lb/>
Lady Cressida. I come to speak with Paris from the<lb/>
Prince Troilus: I will make a complimental assault<lb/>
upon him, for my business seethes.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>
<p>Sodden business! there's a stewed phrase indeed!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter PARIS and HELEN, attended</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair<lb/>
company! fair desires, in all fair measure,<lb/>
fairly guide them! especially to you, fair queen!<lb/>
fair thoughts be your fair pillow!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>
<p>Dear lord, you are full of fair words.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>You speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fair<lb/>
prince, here is good broken music.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>You have broke it, cousin: and, by my life, you<lb/>
shall make it whole again; you shall piece it out<lb/>
with a piece of your performance. Nell, he is full<lb/>
of harmony.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Truly, lady, no.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>
<p>O, sir,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>Well said, my lord! well, you say so in fits.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>I have business to my lord, dear queen. My lord,<lb/>
will you vouchsafe me a word?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>
<p>Nay, this shall not hedge us out: we'll hear you<lb/>
sing, certainly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Well, sweet queen. you are pleasant with me. But,<lb/>
marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord and most esteemed<lb/>
friend, your brother Troilus,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>
<p>My Lord Pandarus; honey-sweet lord,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Go to, sweet queen, to go:&mdash;commends himself most<lb/>
affectionately to you,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>
<p>You shall not bob us out of our melody: if you do,<lb/>
our melancholy upon your head!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Sweet queen, sweet queen! that's a sweet queen, i' faith.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>
<p>And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Nay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall not,<lb/>
in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such words; no,<lb/>
no. And, my lord, he desires you, that if the king<lb/>
call for him at supper, you will make his excuse.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>
<p>My Lord Pandarus,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>What says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>What exploit's in hand? where sups he to-night?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>
<p>Nay, but, my lord,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>What says my sweet queen? My cousin will fall out<lb/>
with you. You must not know where he sups.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>No, no, no such matter; you are wide: come, your<lb/>
disposer is sick.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>Well, I'll make excuse.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida? no,<lb/>
your poor disposer's sick.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>I spy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>You spy! what do you spy? Come, give me an<lb/>
instrument. Now, sweet queen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>
<p>Why, this is kindly done.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have,<lb/>
sweet queen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>
<p>She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my lord Paris.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>He! no, she'll none of him; they two are twain.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>
<p>Falling in, after falling out, may make them three.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Come, come, I'll hear no more of this; I'll sing<lb/>
you a song now.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord, thou<lb/>
hast a fine forehead.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, you may, you may.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>
<p>Let thy song be love: this love will undo us all.<lb/>
O Cupid, Cupid, Cupid!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Love! ay, that it shall, i' faith.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>In good troth, it begins so.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Sings</stage></p>


<p>
Love, love, nothing but love, still more!<lb/>
For, O, love's bow<lb/>
Shoots buck and doe:<lb/>
The shaft confounds,<lb/>
Not that it wounds,<lb/>
But tickles still the sore.<lb/>
These lovers cry Oh! oh! they die!<lb/>
Yet that which seems the wound to kill,<lb/>
Doth turn oh! oh! to ha! ha! he!<lb/>
So dying love lives still:<lb/>
Oh! oh! a while, but ha! ha! ha!<lb/>
Oh! oh! groans out for ha! ha! ha!<lb/>
Heigh-ho!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>
<p>In love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>He eats nothing but doves, love, and that breeds hot<lb/>
blood, and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot<lb/>
thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot deeds is love.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Is this the generation of love? hot blood, hot<lb/>
thoughts, and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers:<lb/>
is love a generation of vipers? Sweet lord, who's<lb/>
a-field to-day?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the<lb/>
gallantry of Troy: I  would fain have armed to-day,<lb/>
but my Nell would not have it so. How chance my<lb/>
brother Troilus went not?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>
<p>He hangs the lip at something: you know all, Lord Pandarus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Not I, honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how they<lb/>
sped to-day. You'll remember your brother's excuse?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>To a hair.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Farewell, sweet queen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>
<p>Commend me to your niece.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>I will, sweet queen.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>



</p><p><stage>A retreat sounded</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>They're come from field: let us to Priam's hall,<lb/>
To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you<lb/>
To help unarm our Hector: his stubborn buckles,<lb/>
With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,<lb/>
Shall more obey than to the edge of steel<lb/>
Or force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more<lb/>
Than all the island kings,&mdash;disarm great Hector.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>
<p>'Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris;<lb/>
Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty<lb/>
Gives us more palm in beauty than we have,<lb/>
Yea, overshines ourself.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>Sweet, above thought I love thee.<lb/>

<head>Scene 2</head>

<p><stage>The same. Pandarus' orchard.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter PANDARUS and Troilus's Boy, meeting</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>How now! where's thy master? at my cousin<lb/>
Cressida's?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>Boy</speaker>
<p>No, sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>O, here he comes.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter TROILUS</stage></p>


<p>
How now, how now!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Sirrah, walk off.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit Boy</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Have you seen my cousin?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>No, Pandarus: I stalk about her door,<lb/>
Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks<lb/>
Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,<lb/>
And give me swift transportance to those fields<lb/>
Where I may wallow in the lily-beds<lb/>
Proposed for the deserver! O gentle Pandarus,<lb/>
From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings<lb/>
And fly with me to Cressid!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Walk here i' the orchard, I'll bring her straight.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.<lb/>
The imaginary relish is so sweet<lb/>
That it enchants my sense: what will it be,<lb/>
When that the watery palate tastes indeed<lb/>
Love's thrice repured nectar? death, I fear me,<lb/>
Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,<lb/>
Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness,<lb/>
For the capacity of my ruder powers:<lb/>
I fear it much; and I do fear besides,<lb/>
That I shall lose distinction in my joys;<lb/>
As doth a battle, when they charge on heaps<lb/>
The enemy flying.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter PANDARUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>She's making her ready, she'll come straight: you<lb/>
must be witty now. She does so blush, and fetches<lb/>
her wind so short, as if she were frayed with a<lb/>
sprite: I'll fetch her. It is the prettiest<lb/>
villain: she fetches her breath as short as a<lb/>
new-ta'en sparrow.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom:<lb/>
My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse;<lb/>
And all my powers do their bestowing lose,<lb/>
Like vassalage at unawares encountering<lb/>
The eye of majesty.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter PANDARUS with CRESSIDA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Come, come, what need you blush? shame's a baby.<lb/>
Here she is now: swear the oaths now to her that<lb/>
you have sworn to me. What, are you gone again?<lb/>
you must be watched ere you be made tame, must you?<lb/>
Come your ways, come your ways; an you draw backward,<lb/>
we'll put you i' the fills. Why do you not speak to<lb/>
her? Come, draw this curtain, and let's see your<lb/>
picture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offend<lb/>
daylight! an 'twere dark, you'ld close sooner.<lb/>
So, so; rub on, and kiss the mistress. How now!<lb/>
a kiss in fee-farm! build there, carpenter; the air<lb/>
is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere<lb/>
I part you. The falcon as the tercel, for all the<lb/>
ducks i' the river: go to, go to.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>You have bereft me of all words, lady.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Words pay no debts, give her deeds: but she'll<lb/>
bereave you o' the deeds too, if she call your<lb/>
activity in question. What, billing again? Here's<lb/>
'In witness whereof the parties interchangeably'&mdash;<lb/>
Come in, come in: I'll go get a fire.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Will you walk in, my lord?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>O Cressida, how often have I wished me thus!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Wished, my lord! The gods grant,&mdash;O my lord!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>What should they grant? what makes this pretty<lb/>
abruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweet<lb/>
lady in the fountain of our love?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Fears make devils of cherubims; they never see truly.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer<lb/>
footing than blind reason stumbling without fear: to<lb/>
fear the worst oft cures the worse.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>O, let my lady apprehend no fear: in all Cupid's<lb/>
pageant there is presented no monster.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Nor nothing monstrous neither?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Nothing, but our undertakings; when we vow to weep<lb/>
seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers; thinking<lb/>
it harder for our mistress to devise imposition<lb/>
enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed.<lb/>
This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will<lb/>
is infinite and the execution confined, that the<lb/>
desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>They say all lovers swear more performance than they<lb/>
are able and yet reserve an ability that they never<lb/>
perform, vowing more than the perfection of ten and<lb/>
discharging less than the tenth part of one. They<lb/>
that have the voice of lions and the act of hares,<lb/>
are they not monsters?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Are there such? such are not we: praise us as we<lb/>
are tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall go<lb/>
bare till merit crown it: no perfection in reversion<lb/>
shall have a praise in present: we will not name<lb/>
desert before his birth, and, being born, his addition<lb/>
shall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilus<lb/>
shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst<lb/>
shall be a mock for his truth, and what truth can<lb/>
speak truest not truer than Troilus.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Will you walk in, my lord?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter PANDARUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>What, blushing still? have you not done talking yet?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>I thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of you,<lb/>
you'll give him me. Be true to my lord: if he<lb/>
flinch, chide me for it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>You know now your hostages; your uncle's word and my<lb/>
firm faith.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Nay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred,<lb/>
though they be long ere they are wooed, they are<lb/>
constant being won: they are burs, I can tell you;<lb/>
they'll stick where they are thrown.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Boldness comes to me now, and brings me heart.<lb/>
Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day<lb/>
For many weary months.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,<lb/>
With the first glance that ever&mdash;pardon me&mdash;<lb/>
If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.<lb/>
I love you now; but not, till now, so much<lb/>
But I might master it: in faith, I lie;<lb/>
My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown<lb/>
Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!<lb/>
Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,<lb/>
When we are so unsecret to ourselves?<lb/>
But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not;<lb/>
And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,<lb/>
Or that we women had men's privilege<lb/>
Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,<lb/>
For in this rapture I shall surely speak<lb/>
The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,<lb/>
Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws<lb/>
My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Pretty, i' faith.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;<lb/>
'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss:<lb/>
I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?<lb/>
For this time will I take my leave, my lord.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Your leave, sweet Cressid!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Pray you, content you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>What offends you, lady?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Sir, mine own company.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>You cannot shun Yourself.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Let me go and try:<lb/>
I have a kind of self resides with you;<lb/>
But an unkind self, that itself will leave,<lb/>
To be another's fool. I would be gone:<lb/>
Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;<lb/>
And fell so roundly to a large confession,<lb/>
To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,<lb/>
Or else you love not, for to be wise and love<lb/>
Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>O that I thought it could be in a woman&mdash;<lb/>
As, if it can, I will presume in you&mdash;<lb/>
To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love;<lb/>
To keep her constancy in plight and youth,<lb/>
Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind<lb/>
That doth renew swifter than blood decays!<lb/>
Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,<lb/>
That my integrity and truth to you<lb/>
Might be affronted with the match and weight<lb/>
Of such a winnow'd purity in love;<lb/>
How were I then uplifted! but, alas!<lb/>
I am as true as truth's simplicity<lb/>
And simpler than the infancy of truth.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>In that I'll war with you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>O virtuous fight,<lb/>
When right with right wars who shall be most right!<lb/>
True swains in love shall in the world to come<lb/>
Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,<lb/>
Full of protest, of oath and big compare,<lb/>
Want similes, truth tired with iteration,<lb/>
As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,<lb/>
As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,<lb/>
As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,<lb/>
Yet, after all comparisons of truth,<lb/>
As truth's authentic author to be cited,<lb/>
'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,<lb/>
And sanctify the numbers.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Prophet may you be!<lb/>
If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,<lb/>
When time is old and hath forgot itself,<lb/>
When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,<lb/>
And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,<lb/>
And mighty states characterless are grated<lb/>
To dusty nothing, yet let memory,<lb/>
From false to false, among false maids in love,<lb/>
Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as false<lb/>
As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,<lb/>
As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer's calf,<lb/>
Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,'<lb/>
'Yea,' let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,<lb/>
'As false as Cressid.'<lb/>

<p>Go to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it; I'll be the<lb/>
witness. Here I hold your hand, here my cousin's.<lb/>
If ever you prove false one to another, since I have<lb/>
taken such pains to bring you together, let all<lb/>
pitiful goers-between be called to the world's end<lb/>
after my name; call them all Pandars; let all<lb/>
constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,<lb/>
and all brokers-between Pandars! say, amen.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Amen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Amen.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with a<lb/>
bed; which bed, because it shall not speak of your<lb/>
pretty encounters, press it to death: away!<lb/>
And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here<lb/>
Bed, chamber, Pandar to provide this gear!<lb/>

<head>Scene 3</head>

<p><stage>The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.</stage>

</p><p><stage>Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, DIOMEDES, NESTOR, AJAX,	MENELAUS, and CALCHAS</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>CALCHAS</speaker>
<p>Now, princes, for the service I have done you,<lb/>
The advantage of the time prompts me aloud<lb/>
To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind<lb/>
That, through the sight I bear in things to love,<lb/>
I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,<lb/>
Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,<lb/>
From certain and possess'd conveniences,<lb/>
To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all<lb/>
That time, acquaintance, custom and condition<lb/>
Made tame and most familiar to my nature,<lb/>
And here, to do you service, am become<lb/>
As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:<lb/>
I do beseech you, as in way of taste,<lb/>
To give me now a little benefit,<lb/>
Out of those many register'd in promise,<lb/>
Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CALCHAS</speaker>
<p>You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,<lb/>
Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.<lb/>
Oft have you&mdash;often have you thanks therefore&mdash;<lb/>
Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,<lb/>
Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,<lb/>
I know, is such a wrest in their affairs<lb/>
That their negotiations all must slack,<lb/>
Wanting his manage; and they will almost<lb/>
Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,<lb/>
In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,<lb/>
And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence<lb/>
Shall quite strike off all service I have done,<lb/>
In most accepted pain.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>Let Diomedes bear him,<lb/>
And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have<lb/>
What he requests of us. Good Diomed,<lb/>
Furnish you fairly for this interchange:<lb/>
Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow<lb/>
Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden<lb/>
Which I am proud to bear.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHAS</stage>



</p><p><stage>Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS, before their tent</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:<lb/>
Please it our general to pass strangely by him,<lb/>
As if he were forgot; and, princes all,<lb/>
Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:<lb/>
I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me<lb/>
Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:<lb/>
If so, I have derision medicinable,<lb/>
To use between your strangeness and his pride,<lb/>
Which his own will shall have desire to drink:<lb/>
It may be good: pride hath no other glass<lb/>
To show itself but pride, for supple knees<lb/>
Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>We'll execute your purpose, and put on<lb/>
A form of strangeness as we pass along:<lb/>
So do each lord, and either greet him not,<lb/>
Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more<lb/>
Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>What, comes the general to speak with me?<lb/>
You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>What says Achilles? would he aught with us?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>Would you, my lord, aught with the general?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>No.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>Nothing, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>The better.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exeunt AGAMEMNON and NESTOR</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Good day, good day.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENELAUS</speaker>
<p>How do you? how do you?<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>What, does the cuckold scorn me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>How now, Patroclus!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, Ajax.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>Ha?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Good morrow.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>Ay, and good next day too.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>They pass by strangely: they were used to bend<lb/>
To send their smiles before them to Achilles;<lb/>
To come as humbly as they used to creep<lb/>
To holy altars.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>What, am I poor of late?<lb/>
'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,<lb/>
Must fall out with men too: what the declined is<lb/>
He shall as soon read in the eyes of others<lb/>
As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,<lb/>
Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,<lb/>
And not a man, for being simply man,<lb/>
Hath any honour, but honour for those honours<lb/>
That are without him, as place, riches, favour,<lb/>
Prizes of accident as oft as merit:<lb/>
Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,<lb/>
The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,<lb/>
Do one pluck down another and together<lb/>
Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:<lb/>
Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy<lb/>
At ample point all that I did possess,<lb/>
Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out<lb/>
Something not worth in me such rich beholding<lb/>
As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;<lb/>
I'll interrupt his reading.<lb/>
How now Ulysses!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Now, great Thetis' son!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>What are you reading?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>A strange fellow here<lb/>
Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,<lb/>
How much in having, or without or in,<lb/>
Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,<lb/>
Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;<lb/>
As when his virtues shining upon others<lb/>
Heat them and they retort that heat again<lb/>
To the first giver.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>This is not strange, Ulysses.<lb/>
The beauty that is borne here in the face<lb/>
The bearer knows not, but commends itself<lb/>
To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,<lb/>
That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,<lb/>
Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed<lb/>
Salutes each other with each other's form;<lb/>
For speculation turns not to itself,<lb/>
Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there<lb/>
Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>I do not strain at the position,&mdash;<lb/>
It is familiar,&mdash;but at the author's drift;<lb/>
Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves<lb/>
That no man is the lord of any thing,<lb/>
Though in and of him there be much consisting,<lb/>
Till he communicate his parts to others:<lb/>
Nor doth he of himself know them for aught<lb/>
Till he behold them form'd in the applause<lb/>
Where they're extended; who, like an arch,<lb/>
reverberates<lb/>
The voice again, or, like a gate of steel<lb/>
Fronting the sun, receives and renders back<lb/>
His figure and his heat.  I was much wrapt in this;<lb/>
And apprehended here immediately<lb/>
The unknown Ajax.<lb/>
Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,<lb/>
That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are<lb/>
Most abject in regard and dear in use!<lb/>
What things again most dear in the esteem<lb/>
And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow&mdash;<lb/>
An act that very chance doth throw upon him&mdash;<lb/>
Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,<lb/>
While some men leave to do!<lb/>
How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,<lb/>
Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!<lb/>
How one man eats into another's pride,<lb/>
While pride is fasting in his wantonness!<lb/>
To see these Grecian lords!&mdash;why, even already<lb/>
They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,<lb/>
As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast<lb/>
And great Troy shrieking.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>I do believe it; for they pass'd by me<lb/>
As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me<lb/>
Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,<lb/>
Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,<lb/>
A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:<lb/>
Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd<lb/>
As fast as they are made, forgot as soon<lb/>
As done: perseverance, dear my lord,<lb/>
Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang<lb/>
Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail<lb/>
In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;<lb/>
For honour travels in a strait so narrow,<lb/>
Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;<lb/>
For emulation hath a thousand sons<lb/>
That one by one pursue: if you give way,<lb/>
Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,<lb/>
Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by<lb/>
And leave you hindmost;<lb/>
Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,<lb/>
Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,<lb/>
O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,<lb/>
Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;<lb/>
For time is like a fashionable host<lb/>
That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,<lb/>
And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,<lb/>
Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,<lb/>
And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not<lb/>
virtue seek<lb/>
Remuneration for the thing it was;<lb/>
For beauty, wit,<lb/>
High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,<lb/>
Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all<lb/>
To envious and calumniating time.<lb/>
One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,<lb/>
That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,<lb/>
Though they are made and moulded of things past,<lb/>
And give to dust that is a little gilt<lb/>
More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.<lb/>
The present eye praises the present object.<lb/>
Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,<lb/>
That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;<lb/>
Since things in motion sooner catch the eye<lb/>
Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,<lb/>
And still it might, and yet it may again,<lb/>
If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive<lb/>
And case thy reputation in thy tent;<lb/>
Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,<lb/>
Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves<lb/>
And drave great Mars to faction.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Of this my privacy<lb/>
I have strong reasons.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>But 'gainst your privacy<lb/>
The reasons are more potent and heroical:<lb/>
'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love<lb/>
With one of Priam's daughters.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Ha! known!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Is that a wonder?<lb/>
The providence that's in a watchful state<lb/>
Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,<lb/>
Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,<lb/>
Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,<lb/>
Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.<lb/>
There is a mystery&mdash;with whom relation<lb/>
Durst never meddle&mdash;in the soul of state;<lb/>
Which hath an operation more divine<lb/>
Than breath or pen can give expressure to:<lb/>
All the commerce that you have had with Troy<lb/>
As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;<lb/>
And better would it fit Achilles much<lb/>
To throw down Hector than Polyxena:<lb/>
But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,<lb/>
When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,<lb/>
And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,<lb/>
'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,<lb/>
But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'<lb/>
Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak;<lb/>
The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:<lb/>
A woman impudent and mannish grown<lb/>
Is not more loathed than an effeminate man<lb/>
In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;<lb/>
They think my little stomach to the war<lb/>
And your great love to me restrains you thus:<lb/>
Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid<lb/>
Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,<lb/>
And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,<lb/>
Be shook to air.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Shall Ajax fight with Hector?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>I see my reputation is at stake<lb/>
My fame is shrewdly gored.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>O, then, beware;<lb/>
Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:<lb/>
Omission to do what is necessary<lb/>
Seals a commission to a blank of danger;<lb/>
And danger, like an ague, subtly taints<lb/>
Even then when we sit idly in the sun.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:<lb/>
I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him<lb/>
To invite the Trojan lords after the combat<lb/>
To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,<lb/>
An appetite that I am sick withal,<lb/>
To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,<lb/>
To talk with him and to behold his visage,<lb/>
Even to my full of view.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Enter THERSITES</stage></p>


<p>
A labour saved!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>A wonder!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>What?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>How so?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so<lb/>
prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he<lb/>
raves in saying nothing.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>How can that be?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,&mdash;a stride<lb/>
and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no<lb/>
arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:<lb/>
bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should<lb/>
say 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out;'<lb/>
and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire<lb/>
in a flint, which will not show without knocking.<lb/>
The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his<lb/>
neck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in<lb/>
vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,<lb/>
Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think<lb/>
you of this man that takes me for the general? He's<lb/>
grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.<lb/>
A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both<lb/>
sides, like a leather jerkin.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Who, I? why, he'll answer nobody; he professes not<lb/>
answering: speaking is for beggars; he wears his<lb/>
tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: let<lb/>
Patroclus make demands to me, you shall see the<lb/>
pageant of Ajax.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>To him, Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire the<lb/>
valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector<lb/>
to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure<lb/>
safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous<lb/>
and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured<lb/>
captain-general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,<lb/>
et cetera. Do this.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>Jove bless great Ajax!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Hum!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>I come from the worthy Achilles,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Ha!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Hum!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Agamemnon!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Ha!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>What say you to't?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>God b' wi' you, with all my heart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>Your answer, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>If to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven o'clock it will<lb/>
go one way or other: howsoever, he shall pay for me<lb/>
ere he has me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>
<p>Your answer, sir.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Fare you well, with all my heart.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>No, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be in<lb/>
him when Hector has knocked out his brains, I know<lb/>
not; but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apollo<lb/>
get his sinews to make catlings on.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Let me bear another to his horse; for that's the more<lb/>
capable creature.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd;<lb/>
And I myself see not the bottom of it.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Would the fountain of your mind were clear again,<lb/>
that I might water an ass at it! I had rather be a<lb/>
tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter, from one side, AENEAS, and Servant with a	torch; from the other, PARIS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR,	DIOMEDES, and others, with torches</stage>


</p><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>See, ho! who is that there?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DEIPHOBUS</speaker>
<p>It is the Lord AEneas.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>Is the prince there in person?<lb/>
Had I so good occasion to lie long<lb/>
As you, prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business<lb/>
Should rob my bed-mate of my company.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>A valiant Greek, AEneas,&mdash;take his hand,&mdash;<lb/>
Witness the process of your speech, wherein<lb/>
You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,<lb/>
Did haunt you in the field.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>Health to you, valiant sir,<lb/>
During all question of the gentle truce;<lb/>
But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance<lb/>
As heart can think or courage execute.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>The one and other Diomed embraces.<lb/>
Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health!<lb/>
But when contention and occasion meet,<lb/>
By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life<lb/>
With all my force, pursuit and policy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly<lb/>
With his face backward. In humane gentleness,<lb/>
Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,<lb/>
Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,<lb/>
No man alive can love in such a sort<lb/>
The thing he means to kill more excellently.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>We sympathize: Jove, let AEneas live,<lb/>
If to my sword his fate be not the glory,<lb/>
A thousand complete courses of the sun!<lb/>
But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,<lb/>
With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>We know each other well.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>We do; and long to know each other worse.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,<lb/>
The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.<lb/>
What business, lord, so early?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>I was sent for to the king; but why, I know not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek<lb/>
To Calchas' house, and there to render him,<lb/>
For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:<lb/>
Let's have your company, or, if you please,<lb/>
Haste there before us: I constantly do think&mdash;<lb/>
Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge&mdash;<lb/>
My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:<lb/>
Rouse him and give him note of our approach.<lb/>
With the whole quality wherefore: I fear<lb/>
We shall be much unwelcome.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>That I assure you:<lb/>
Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece<lb/>
Than Cressid borne from Troy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>There is no help;<lb/>
The bitter disposition of the time<lb/>
Will have it so. On, lord; we'll follow you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, all.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit with Servant</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,<lb/>
Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,<lb/>
Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best,<lb/>
Myself or Menelaus?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>Both alike:<lb/>
He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,<lb/>
Not making any scruple of her soilure,<lb/>
With such a hell of pain and world of charge,<lb/>
And you as well to keep her, that defend her,<lb/>
Not palating the taste of her dishonour,<lb/>
With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:<lb/>
He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up<lb/>
The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;<lb/>
You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins<lb/>
Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:<lb/>
Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;<lb/>
But he as he, the heavier for a whore.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>
<p>You are too bitter to your countrywoman.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:<lb/>
For every false drop in her bawdy veins<lb/>
A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple<lb/>
Of her contaminated carrion weight,<lb/>
A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,<lb/>
She hath not given so many good words breath<lb/>
As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.<lb/>

</p><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down;<lb/>
He shall unbolt the gates.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Trouble him not;<lb/>
To bed, to bed: sleep kill those pretty eyes,<lb/>
And give as soft attachment to thy senses<lb/>
As infants' empty of all thought!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Good morrow, then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>I prithee now, to bed.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Are you a-weary of me?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>O Cressida! but that the busy day,<lb/>
Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,<lb/>
And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,<lb/>
I would not from thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Night hath been too brief.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays<lb/>
As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love<lb/>
With wings more momentary-swift than thought.<lb/>
You will catch cold, and curse me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Prithee, tarry:<lb/>
You men will never tarry.<lb/>
O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,<lb/>
And then you would have tarried. Hark!<lb/>
there's one up.<lb/>

I shall have such a life!<lb/>

maid! where's my cousin Cressid?<lb/>

<p>Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle!<lb/>
You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.<lb/>

what: what have I brought you to do?<lb/>

I knew you not: what news with you so early?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>Is not Prince Troilus here?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Here! what should he do here?<lb/>

<p>Come, he is here, my lord; do not deny him:<lb/>
It doth import him much to speak with me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Is he here, say you? 'tis more than I know, I'll<lb/>
be sworn: for my own part, I came in late. What<lb/>
should he do here?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>Who!&mdash;nay, then: come, come, you'll do him wrong<lb/>
ere you're ware: you'll be so true to him, to be<lb/>
false to him: do not you know of him, but yet go<lb/>
fetch him hither; go.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter TROILUS</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>How now! what's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,<lb/>
My matter is so rash: there is at hand<lb/>
Paris your brother, and Deiphobus,<lb/>
The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor<lb/>
Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,<lb/>
Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,<lb/>
We must give up to Diomedes' hand<lb/>
The Lady Cressida.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Is it so concluded?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>By Priam and the general state of Troy:<lb/>
They are at hand and ready to effect it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>How my achievements mock me!<lb/>
I will go meet them: and, my Lord AEneas,<lb/>
We met by chance; you did not find me here.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>Good, good, my lord; the secrets of nature<lb/>
Have not more gift in taciturnity.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Is't possible? no sooner got but lost? The devil<lb/>

plague upon Antenor! I would they had broke 's neck!<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Re-enter CRESSIDA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>How now! what's the matter? who was here?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Ah, ah!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Why sigh you so profoundly? where's my lord? gone!<lb/>
Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>O the gods! what's the matter?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er been<lb/>
born! I knew thou wouldst be his death. O, poor<lb/>
gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees! beseech you,<lb/>
what's the matter?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Thou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thou<lb/>
art changed for Antenor: thou must to thy father,<lb/>
and be gone from Troilus: 'twill be his death;<lb/>
'twill be his bane; he cannot bear it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>O you immortal gods! I will not go.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Thou must.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>I will not, uncle: I have forgot my father;<lb/>
I know no touch of consanguinity;<lb/>
No kin no love, no blood, no soul so near me<lb/>
As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine!<lb/>
Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,<lb/>
If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,<lb/>
Do to this body what extremes you can;<lb/>
But the strong base and building of my love<lb/>
Is as the very centre of the earth,<lb/>
Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep,&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Do, do.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks,<lb/>
Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart<lb/>
With sounding Troilus. I will not go from Troy.<lb/>

<p>Be moderate, be moderate.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Why tell you me of moderation?<lb/>
The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,<lb/>
And violenteth in a sense as strong<lb/>
As that which causeth it: how can I moderate it?<lb/>
If I could temporize with my affection,<lb/>
Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,<lb/>

<p>
Ah, sweet ducks!<lb/>

<p>O Troilus! Troilus!<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Embracing him</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>What a pair of spectacles is here!<lb/>
Let me embrace too. 'O heart,' as the goodly saying is,<lb/>
'&mdash;O heart, heavy heart,<lb/>
Why sigh'st thou without breaking?<lb/>
where he answers again,<lb/>
'Because thou canst not ease thy smart<lb/>
By friendship nor by speaking.'<lb/>
There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away<lb/>
nothing, for we may live to have need of such a<lb/>
verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Cressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity,<lb/>
That the bless'd gods, as angry with my fancy,<lb/>
More bright in zeal than the devotion which<lb/>
Cold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Have the gods envy?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, ay, ay, ay; 'tis too plain a case.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>And is it true that I must go from Troy?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>A hateful truth.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>What, and from Troilus too?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>From Troy and Troilus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Is it possible?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>And suddenly; where injury of chance<lb/>
Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by<lb/>
All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips<lb/>
Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents<lb/>
Our lock'd embrasures, strangles our dear vows<lb/>
Even in the birth of our own labouring breath:<lb/>
We two, that with so many thousand sighs<lb/>
Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves<lb/>
With the rude brevity and discharge of one.<lb/>
Injurious time now with a robber's haste<lb/>
Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not how:<lb/>
As many farewells as be stars in heaven,<lb/>
With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them,<lb/>
He fumbles up into a lose adieu,<lb/>
And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,<lb/>
Distasted with the salt of broken tears.<lb/>

<p>A woful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>I true! how now! what wicked deem is this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,<lb/>
For it is parting from us:<lb/>
I speak not 'be thou true,' as fearing thee,<lb/>
For I will throw my glove to Death himself,<lb/>
That there's no maculation in thy heart:<lb/>
But 'be thou true,' say I, to fashion in<lb/>
My sequent protestation; be thou true,<lb/>
And I will see thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>O, you shall be exposed, my lord, to dangers<lb/>
As infinite as imminent! but I'll be true.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>And you this glove. When shall I see you?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,<lb/>

But yet be true.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>O heavens! 'be true' again!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Hear while I speak it, love:<lb/>
The Grecian youths are full of quality;<lb/>
They're loving, well composed with gifts of nature,<lb/>
Flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise:<lb/>
How novelty may move, and parts with person,<lb/>
Alas, a kind of godly jealousy&mdash;<lb/>
Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin&mdash;<lb/>
Makes me afeard.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>O heavens! you love me not.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Die I a villain, then!<lb/>
In this I do not call your faith in question<lb/>
So mainly as my merit: I cannot sing,<lb/>
Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,<lb/>
Nor play at subtle games; fair virtues all,<lb/>
To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant:<lb/>
But I can tell that in each grace of these<lb/>
There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil<lb/>
That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Do you think I will?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>No.<lb/>
But something may be done that we will not:<lb/>
And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,<lb/>
When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,<lb/>
Presuming on their changeful potency.<lb/>

<p>Who, I? alas, it is my vice, my fault:<lb/>
Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,<lb/>
I with great truth catch mere simplicity;<lb/>
Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,<lb/>
With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.<lb/>
Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit<lb/>
Is 'plain and true;' there's all the reach of it.<lb/>

You shall be mistress, and command him wholly.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously,<lb/>
To shame the zeal of my petition to thee<lb/>
In praising her: I tell thee, lord of Greece,<lb/>
She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises<lb/>
As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.<lb/>
I charge thee use her well, even for my charge;<lb/>
For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,<lb/>
Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,<lb/>
I'll cut thy throat.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>O, be not moved, Prince Troilus:<lb/>
Let me be privileged by my place and message,<lb/>
To be a speaker free; when I am hence<lb/>
I'll answer to my lust: and know you, lord,<lb/>
I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth<lb/>
She shall be prized; but that you say 'be't so,'<lb/>
I'll speak it in my spirit and honour, 'no.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Come, to the port. I'll tell thee, Diomed,<lb/>
This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.<lb/>
Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,<lb/>
To our own selves bend we our needful talk.<lb/>

<p>No, I'll be sworn.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>It were no match, your nail against his horn.<lb/>
May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>You may.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>I do desire it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Why, beg, then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Why then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss,<lb/>
When Helen is a maid again, and his.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>I am your debtor, claim it when 'tis due.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Never's my day, and then a kiss of you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>Lady, a word: I'll bring you to your father.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit with CRESSIDA</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>A woman of quick sense.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Fie, fie upon her!<lb/>
There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,<lb/>
Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out<lb/>
At every joint and motive of her body.<lb/>
O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,<lb/>
That give accosting welcome ere it comes,<lb/>
And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts<lb/>
To every ticklish reader! set them down<lb/>
For sluttish spoils of opportunity<lb/>
And daughters of the game.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Trumpet within</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ALL</speaker>
<p>The Trojans' trumpet.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>Yonder comes the troop.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Enter HECTOR, armed; AENEAS, TROILUS, and other	Trojans, with Attendants</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done<lb/>
To him that victory commands? or do you purpose<lb/>
A victor shall be known? will you the knights<lb/>
Shall to the edge of all extremity<lb/>
Pursue each other, or shall be divided<lb/>
By any voice or order of the field?<lb/>
Hector bade ask.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>Which way would Hector have it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>He cares not; he'll obey conditions.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>'Tis done like Hector; but securely done,<lb/>
A little proudly, and great deal misprizing<lb/>
The knight opposed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>If not Achilles, sir,<lb/>
What is your name?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>If not Achilles, nothing.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>Therefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this:<lb/>
In the extremity of great and little,<lb/>
Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector;<lb/>
The one almost as infinite as all,<lb/>
The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,<lb/>
And that which looks like pride is courtesy.<lb/>
This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:<lb/>
In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;<lb/>
Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek<lb/>
This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>A maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Re-enter DIOMEDES</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,<lb/>
Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneas<lb/>
Consent upon the order of their fight,<lb/>
So be it; either to the uttermost,<lb/>
Or else a breath: the combatants being kin<lb/>
Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>AJAX and HECTOR enter the lists</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>They are opposed already.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,<lb/>
Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,<lb/>
Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;<lb/>
Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd:<lb/>
His heart and hand both open and both free;<lb/>
For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;<lb/>
Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,<lb/>
Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;<lb/>
Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;<lb/>
For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes<lb/>
To tender objects, but he in heat of action<lb/>
Is more vindicative than jealous love:<lb/>
They call him Troilus, and on him erect<lb/>
A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.<lb/>
Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youth<lb/>
Even to his inches, and with private soul<lb/>
Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Alarum. Hector and Ajax fight</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>They are in action.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>Now, Ajax, hold thine own!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Hector, thou sleep'st;<lb/>
Awake thee!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>His blows are well disposed: there, Ajax!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>You must no more.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Trumpets cease</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>Princes, enough, so please you.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>I am not warm yet; let us fight again.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>As Hector pleases.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>Why, then will I no more:<lb/>
Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,<lb/>
A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;<lb/>
The obligation of our blood forbids<lb/>
A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:<lb/>
Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so<lb/>
That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,<lb/>
And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg<lb/>
All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood<lb/>
Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister<lb/>
Bounds in my father's;' by Jove multipotent,<lb/>
Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member<lb/>
Wherein my sword had not impressure made<lb/>
Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay<lb/>
That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,<lb/>
My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword<lb/>
Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:<lb/>
By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;<lb/>
Hector would have them fall upon him thus:<lb/>
Cousin, all honour to thee!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>I thank thee, Hector<lb/>
Thou art too gentle and too free a man:<lb/>
I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence<lb/>
A great addition earned in thy death.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>Not Neoptolemus so mirable,<lb/>
On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes<lb/>
Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself<lb/>
A thought of added honour torn from Hector.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>There is expectance here from both the sides,<lb/>
What further you will do.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>We'll answer it;<lb/>
The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>If I might in entreaties find success&mdash;<lb/>
As seld I have the chance&mdash;I would desire<lb/>
My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great Achilles<lb/>
Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>AEneas, call my brother Troilus to me,<lb/>
And signify this loving interview<lb/>
To the expecters of our Trojan part;<lb/>
Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin;<lb/>
I will go eat with thee and see your knights.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>The worthiest of them tell me name by name;<lb/>
But for Achilles, mine own searching eyes<lb/>
Shall find him by his large and portly size.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one<lb/>
That would be rid of such an enemy;<lb/>
But that's no welcome: understand more clear,<lb/>
What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks<lb/>
And formless ruin of oblivion;<lb/>
But in this extant moment, faith and troth,<lb/>
Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,<lb/>
Bids thee, with most divine integrity,<lb/>
From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p><stage>[To TROILUS]</stage></p><p>  My well-famed lord of Troy, no<lb/>
less to you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENELAUS</speaker>
<p>Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting:<lb/>
You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>Who must we answer?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>The noble Menelaus.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>O, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!<lb/>
Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath;<lb/>
Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:<lb/>
She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>MENELAUS</speaker>
<p>Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>O, pardon; I offend.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft<lb/>
Labouring for destiny make cruel way<lb/>
Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,<lb/>
As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,<lb/>
Despising many forfeits and subduements,<lb/>
When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,<lb/>
Not letting it decline on the declined,<lb/>
That I have said to some my standers by<lb/>
'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!'<lb/>
And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,<lb/>
When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,<lb/>
Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;<lb/>
But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,<lb/>
I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,<lb/>
And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;<lb/>
But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,<lb/>
Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee;<lb/>
And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>
<p>'Tis the old Nestor.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,<lb/>
That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:<lb/>
Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>I would my arms could match thee in contention,<lb/>
As they contend with thee in courtesy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>I would they could.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>
<p>Ha!<lb/>
By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee to-morrow.<lb/>
Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>I wonder now how yonder city stands<lb/>
When we have here her base and pillar by us.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.<lb/>
Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,<lb/>
Since first I saw yourself and Diomed<lb/>
In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue:<lb/>
My prophecy is but half his journey yet;<lb/>
For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,<lb/>
Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,<lb/>
Must kiss their own feet.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>I must not believe you:<lb/>
There they stand yet, and modestly I think,<lb/>
The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost<lb/>
A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,<lb/>
And that old common arbitrator, Time,<lb/>
Will one day end it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>So to him we leave it.<lb/>
Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome:<lb/>
After the general, I beseech you next<lb/>
To feast with me and see me at my tent.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!<lb/>
Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;<lb/>
I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,<lb/>
And quoted joint by joint.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>Is this Achilles?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>I am Achilles.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Behold thy fill.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>Nay, I have done already.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Thou art too brief: I will the second time,<lb/>
As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er;<lb/>
But there's more in me than thou understand'st.<lb/>
Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body<lb/>
Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?<lb/>
That I may give the local wound a name<lb/>
And make distinct the very breach whereout<lb/>
Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,<lb/>
To answer such a question: stand again:<lb/>
Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly<lb/>
As to prenominate in nice conjecture<lb/>
Where thou wilt hit me dead?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>I tell thee, yea.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,<lb/>
I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;<lb/>
For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;<lb/>
But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,<lb/>
I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er.<lb/>
You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;<lb/>
His insolence draws folly from my lips;<lb/>
But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,<lb/>
Or may I never&mdash;<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>
<p>Do not chafe thee, cousin:<lb/>
And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,<lb/>
Till accident or purpose bring you to't:<lb/>
You may have every day enough of Hector<lb/>
If you have stomach; the general state, I fear,<lb/>
Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>I pray you, let us see you in the field:<lb/>
We have had pelting wars, since you refused<lb/>
The Grecians' cause.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>
<p>Dost thou entreat me, Hector?<lb/>
To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death;<lb/>
To-night all friends.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>
<p>Thy hand upon that match.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>
<p>First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;<lb/>
There in the full convive we: afterwards,<lb/>
As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall<lb/>
Concur together, severally entreat him.<lb/>
Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,<lb/>
That this great soldier may his welcome know.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exeunt all except TROILUS and ULYSSES</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,<lb/>
In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>At Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus:<lb/>
There Diomed doth feast with him to-night;<lb/>
Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,<lb/>
But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view<lb/>
On the fair Cressid.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Shall sweet lord, be bound to you so much,<lb/>
After we part from Agamemnon's tent,<lb/>
To bring me thither?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>You shall command me, sir.<lb/>
As gentle tell me, of what honour was<lb/>
This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there<lb/>
That wails her absence?<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars<lb/>
A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?<lb/>
She was beloved, she loved; she is, and doth:<lb/>
But still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth.<lb/>

dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a toad, a lizard, an<lb/>
owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would<lb/>
not care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspire<lb/>

his mouth, and promise, like Brabbler the hound:<lb/>
but when he performs, astronomers foretell it; it<lb/>
is prodigious, there will come some change; the sun<lb/>
borrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps his<lb/>
word. I will rather leave to see Hector, than<lb/>
not to dog him: they say he keeps a Trojan<lb/>
drab, and uses the traitor Calchas' tent: I'll<lb/>
after. Nothing but lechery! all incontinent varlets!<lb/>

<p>In faith, I will, la; never trust me else.<lb/>

<p>Now the pledge; now, now, now!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Here, Diomed, keep this sleeve.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>O beauty! where is thy faith?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>My lord,&mdash;<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>I will be patient; outwardly I will.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>You look upon that sleeve; behold it well.<lb/>
He loved me&mdash;O false wench!&mdash;Give't me again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>Whose was't?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>It is no matter, now I have't again.<lb/>
I will not meet with you to-morrow night:<lb/>
I prithee, Diomed, visit me no more.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Now she sharpens: well said, whetstone!<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>I shall have it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>What, this?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>Ay, that.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!<lb/>
Thy master now lies thinking in his bed<lb/>
Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,<lb/>
And gives memorial dainty kisses to it,<lb/>
As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me;<lb/>
He that takes that doth take my heart withal.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>I had your heart before, this follows it.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>I did swear patience.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>You shall not have it, Diomed; faith, you shall not;<lb/>
I'll give you something else.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>I will have this: whose was it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>It is no matter.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>Come, tell me whose it was.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>'Twas one's that loved me better than you will.<lb/>
But, now you have it, take it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>Whose was it?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>By all Diana's waiting-women yond,<lb/>
And by herself, I will not tell you whose.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,<lb/>
And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Wert thou the devil, and worest it on thy horn,<lb/>
It should be challenged.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past: and yet it is not;<lb/>
I will not keep my word.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>Why, then, farewell;<lb/>
Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,<lb/>
But it straight starts you.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>I do not like this fooling.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Nor I, by Pluto: but that that likes not you pleases me best.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>What, shall I come? the hour?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Ay, come:&mdash;O Jove!&mdash;do come:&mdash;I shall be plagued.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>
<p>Farewell till then.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>
<p>Good night: I prithee, come.<lb/>

</p><p><stage>Exit DIOMEDES</stage></p>


<p>
Troilus, farewell! one eye yet looks on thee<lb/>
But with my heart the other eye doth see.<lb/>
Ah, poor our sex! this fault in us I find,<lb/>
The error of our eye directs our mind:<lb/>
What error leads must err; O, then conclude<lb/>
Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude.<lb/>


</p><p><stage>Exit</stage>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>A proof of strength she could not publish more,<lb/>
Unless she said ' My mind is now turn'd whore.'<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>All's done, my lord.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>It is.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Why stay we, then?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>To make a recordation to my soul<lb/>
Of every syllable that here was spoke.<lb/>
But if I tell how these two did co-act,<lb/>
Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?<lb/>
Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,<lb/>
An esperance so obstinately strong,<lb/>
That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears,<lb/>
As if those organs had deceptious functions,<lb/>
Created only to calumniate.<lb/>
Was Cressid here?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>I cannot conjure, Trojan.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>She was not, sure.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Most sure she was.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Why, my negation hath no taste of madness.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Let it not be believed for womanhood!<lb/>
Think, we had mothers; do not give advantage<lb/>
To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme,<lb/>
For depravation, to square the general sex<lb/>
By Cressid's rule: rather think this not Cressid.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>What hath she done, prince, that can soil our mothers?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Nothing at all, unless that this were she.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>Will he swagger himself out on's own eyes?<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>This she? no, this is Diomed's Cressida:<lb/>
If beauty have a soul, this is not she;<lb/>
If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,<lb/>
If sanctimony be the gods' delight,<lb/>
If there be rule in unity itself,<lb/>
This is not she. O madness of discourse,<lb/>
That cause sets up with and against itself!<lb/>
Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt<lb/>
Without perdition, and loss assume all reason<lb/>
Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid.<lb/>
Within my soul there doth conduce a fight<lb/>
Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate<lb/>
Divides more wider than the sky and earth,<lb/>
And yet the spacious breadth of this division<lb/>
Admits no orifex for a point as subtle<lb/>
As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.<lb/>
Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;<lb/>
Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven:<lb/>
Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself;<lb/>
The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolved, and loosed;<lb/>
And with another knot, five-finger-tied,<lb/>
The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,<lb/>
The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics<lb/>
Of her o'er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>May worthy Troilus be half attach'd<lb/>
With that which here his passion doth express?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Ay, Greek; and that shall be divulged well<lb/>
In characters as red as Mars his heart<lb/>
Inflamed with Venus: never did young man fancy<lb/>
With so eternal and so fix'd a soul.<lb/>
Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,<lb/>
So much by weight hate I her Diomed:<lb/>
That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm;<lb/>
Were it a casque composed by Vulcan's skill,<lb/>
My sword should bite it: not the dreadful spout<lb/>
Which shipmen do the hurricano call,<lb/>
Constringed in mass by the almighty sun,<lb/>
Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune's ear<lb/>
In his descent than shall my prompted sword<lb/>
Falling on Diomed.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>
<p>He'll tickle it for his concupy.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>O Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false!<lb/>
Let all untruths stand by thy stained name,<lb/>
And they'll seem glorious.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>O, contain yourself<lb/>
Your passion draws ears hither.<lb/>

Ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.<lb/>



</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Have with you, prince. My courteous lord, adieu.<lb/>
Farewell, revolted fair! and, Diomed,<lb/>
Stand fast, and wear a castle on thy head!<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>
<p>I'll bring you to the gates.<lb/>

<p>Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would<lb/>
croak like a raven; I would bode, I would bode.<lb/>
Patroclus will give me any thing for the<lb/>
intelligence of this whore: the parrot will not<lb/>
do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab.<lb/>
Lechery, lechery; still, wars and lechery; nothing<lb/>
else holds fashion: a burning devil take them!<lb/>

<p>The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows:<lb/>
They are polluted offerings, more abhorr'd<lb/>
Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>ANDROMACHE</speaker>
<p>O, be persuaded! do not count it holy<lb/>

For we would give much, to use violent thefts,<lb/>

<p>Here's a letter come from yond poor girl.<lb/>

</p></sp><sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>
<p>A whoreson tisick, a whoreson rascally tisick so<lb/>
troubles me, and the foolish fortune of this girl;<lb/>
and what one thing, what another, that I shall<lb/>
leave you one o' these days: and I have a rheum<lb/>
in mine eyes too, and such an ache in my bones<lb/>
that, unless a man were cursed, I cannot tell what<lb/>
to think on't. What says she there?<lb/>


</p></sp><sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>
<p>Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart:<lb/>
The effect doth operate another way.<lb/>

<p>Now they are clapper-clawing one another; I'll go<lb/>
look on. That dissembling abominable varlets Diomed,<lb/>
has got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave's<lb/>
sleeve of Troy there in his helm: I would fain see<lb/>
them meet; that that same young Trojan ass, that<lb/>
loves the whore there, might send that Greekish<lb/>
whore-masterly villain, with the sleeve, back to the<lb/>
dissembling luxurious drab, of a sleeveless errand.<lb/>
O' the t'other side, the policy of those crafty<lb/>
swearing rascals, that stale old mouse-eaten dry<lb/>
cheese, Nestor, and that same dog-fox, Ulysses, is<lb/>
not proved worthy a blackberry: they set me up, in<lb/>
policy, that mongrel cur, Ajax, against that dog of<lb/>
as bad a kind, Achilles: and now is the cur Ajax<lb/>
prouder than the cur Achilles, and will not arm<lb/>
to-day; whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaim<lb/>
barbarism, and policy grows into an ill opinion.<lb/>
Soft! here comes sleeve, and t'other.<lb/>

Hath beat down Menon: bastard Margarelon<lb/>
Hath Doreus prisoner,<lb/>
And stands colossus-wise, waving his beam,<lb/>
Upon the pashed corses of the kings<lb/>
Epistrophus and Cedius: Polyxenes is slain,<lb/>
Amphimachus and Thoas deadly hurt,<lb/>
Patroclus ta'en or slain, and Palamedes<lb/>
Sore hurt and bruised: the dreadful Sagittary<lb/>
Appals our numbers: haste we, Diomed,<lb/>

There is a thousand Hectors in the field:<lb/>
Now here he fights on Galathe his horse,<lb/>
And there lacks work; anon he's there afoot,<lb/>
And there they fly or die, like scaled sculls<lb/>
Before the belching whale; then is he yonder,<lb/>
And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,<lb/>
Fall down before him, like the mower's swath:<lb/>
Here, there, and every where, he leaves and takes,<lb/>
Dexterity so obeying appetite<lb/>
That what he will he does, and does so much<lb/>
That proof is call'd impossibility.<lb/>

Patroclus' wounds have roused his drowsy blood,<lb/>
Together with his mangled Myrmidons,<lb/>
That noseless, handless, hack'd and chipp'd, come to him,<lb/>
Crying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friend<lb/>
And foams at mouth, and he is arm'd and at it,<lb/>
Roaring for Troilus, who hath done to-day<lb/>
Mad and fantastic execution,<lb/>
Engaging and redeeming of himself<lb/>
With such a careless force and forceless care<lb/>
As if that luck, in very spite of cunning,<lb/>
Bade him win all.<lb/>
