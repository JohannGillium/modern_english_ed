<head>Their Dear Little Ghost<ref target="n1">[1]</ref><lb/> 
By Elia W. Peattie</head> 
 

 
<note><p> 
     ["The Shape of Fear" is the suggestive title of a little volume 
of ghostly tales by Elia W. Peattie, of an unusual quality.  Mrs. 
Peattie has brought to the writing of the ghost story the art of clear, 
direct, and suggestive treatment.  The stories are all short, but each 
one leaves a vivid impression on the mind of the reader.  "Their 
Dear Little Ghost" is reprinted from the volume by the courtesy of 
Mrs. Peattie's publishers, the Macmillan Company, of this city. &mdash; 
THE EDITORS.]</p></note> 
 
<p>     THE first time one looked at Elsbeth, one was not 
prepossessed.  She was thin and brown, her nose turned slightly 
upward, her toes went in just a perceptible degree, and her hair was 
perfectly straight.  But when one looked longer, one perceived that 
she was a charming little creature.  The straight hair was as fine as 
silk, and hung in funny little braids down her back; there was not a 
flaw in her soft brown skin; and her mouth was tender and shapely. 
But her particular charm lay in a look which she habitually had, of 
seeming to know curious things &mdash; such as it is not allotted to 
ordinary persons to know.  One felt tempted to say to her: 
</p><p>"What are these beautiful things which you know, and of 
which others are ignorant?  What is it you see with those wise and 
pellucid eyes?  Why is it that everybody loves you?" 
</p><p>Elsbeth was my little godchild, and I knew her better than I 
knew any other child in the world.  But still I could not truthfully 
say that I was familiar with her, for to me her spirit was like a fair 
and fragrant road in the midst of which I might walk in peace and 
joy, but where I was continually to discover something new.  The 
last time I saw her quite well and strong was over in the woods 
where she had gone with her two little brothers and her nurse to 
pass the hottest weeks of summer.  I followed her, foolish old 
creature that I was, just to be near her, for I needed to dwell where 
the sweet aroma of her life could reach me. 
</p><p>One morning, when I came from my room, limping a little, 
because I am not so young as I used to be, and the lake wind works 
havoc with me, my little godchild came dancing to me, singing: 
</p><p>"Come with me and I'll show you my places, my places, my 
places!" 
</p><p>Miriam, when she chanted by the Red Sea, might have been 
more exultant, but she could not have been more bewitching.  Of 
course I knew what "places" were, because I had once been a little 
girl myself; but unless you are acquainted with the real meaning of 
"places," it would be useless to try to explain.  Either you know 
"places" or you do not &mdash; just as you understand the meaning of 
poetry or you do not.  There are things in the world which cannot be 
taught. 
</p><p>Elsbeth's two tiny brothers were present, and I took one by each 
hand and followed her.  No sooner had we got out-of-doors in the 
woods than a sort of mystery fell upon the world and upon us.  We 
were cautioned to move silently, and we did so, avoiding the 
crunching of dry twigs. 
</p><p>"The fairies hate noise," whispered my little godchild, her eyes 
narrowing like a cat's. 
</p><p>"I must get my wand first thing I do," she said, in an awed 
undertone.  "It is useless to try to do anything without a wand." 
</p><p>The tiny boys were profoundly impressed, and, indeed, so was 
I.  I felt that at last I should, if I behaved properly, see the fairies, 
which had hitherto avoided my materialistic gaze.  It was an 
enchanting moment, for there appeared, just then, to be nothing 
commonplace about life. 
</p><p>There was a swale near by, and into this the little girl plunged. 
I could see her red straw hat bobbing about among the tall rushes, 
and I wondered if there were snakes. 
</p><p>"Do you think there are snakes?" I asked one of the tiny boys. 
</p><p>"If there are," he said with conviction, "they won't dare hurt 
her." 
</p><p>He convinced me.  I feared no more.  Presently Elsbeth came 
out of the swale.  In her hand was a brown "cattail," perfectly full 
and round.  She carried it as queens carry their scepters &mdash; the 
beautiful queens we dream of in our youth. 
</p><p>"Come," she commanded, and waved the scepter in a fine 
manner.  So we followed, each tiny boy gripping my hand tight. 
We were all three a trifle awed.  Elsbeth led us 
   <pb n="531"/>  
into a dark underbrush.  The branches, as they flew back in our 
faces, left them wet with dew.  A wee path, made by the girl's dear 
feet, guided our footsteps.  Perfumes of elderberry and wild 
cucumber scented the air.  A bird, frightened from its nest, made 
frantic cries above our heads.  The underbrush thickened.  Presently 
the gloom of the hemlocks was over us, and in the midst of the 
shadowy green a tulip-tree flaunted its leaves.  Waves boomed and 
broke upon the shore below.  There was a growing dampness as we 
went on, treading very lightly.  A little green snake ran coquettishly 
from us.  A fat and glossy squirrel chattered at us from a safe height, 
stroking his whiskers with a complaisant air. 
</p><p>At length we reached the "place."  It was a circle of velvet 
grass, bright as the first blades of spring, delicate as fine sea-ferns. 
The sunlight, falling down the shaft between the hemlocks, flooded 
it with a softened light and made the forest round about look like 
deep purple velvet.  My little godchild stood in the midst and raised 
her wand impressively. 
</p><p>"This is my place," she said, with a sort of wonderful gladness 
in her tone.  "This is where I come to the fairy balls.  Do you see 
them?" 
</p><p>"See what?" whispered one tiny boy. 
</p><p>"The fairies." 
</p><p>There was a silence.  The older boy pulled at my skirt. 
</p><p>"Do <hi rend="italic">you</hi> see them?" he asked, his voice trembling with 
expectancy. 
</p><p>"Indeed," I said, "I fear I am too old and wicked to see fairies, 
and yet &mdash; are their hats red?" 
</p><p>"They are," laughed my little girl.  "Their hats are red, and as 
small &mdash; as small!"  She held up the pearly nail of her wee finger to 
give us the correct idea. 
</p><p>"And their shoes are very pointed at the toes?" 
</p><p>"Oh, very pointed!" 
</p><p>"And their garments are green?" 
</p><p>"As green as grass." 
</p><p>"And they blow little horns?" 
</p><p>"The sweetest little horns!" 
</p><p>"I think I see them," I cried. 
</p><p>"We think we see them too," said the tiny boys, laughing in 
perfect glee. 
</p><p>"And you hear their horns, don't you?" my little godchild 
asked, somewhat anxiously. 
</p><p>"Don't we hear their horns?" I asked the tiny boys. 
</p><p>"We think we hear their horns," they cried.  "Don't you think 
we do?" 
</p><p>"It must be we do," I said.  "Aren't we very, very happy?" 
</p><p>We all laughed softly.  Then we kissed each other, and Elsbeth 
led us out, her want high in the air. 
</p><p>And so my feet found the lost path to Arcady. 
</p><p>The next day I was called to the Pacific coast, and duty kept 
me there till well into December.  A few days before the date set for 
my return to my home, a letter came from Elsbeth's mother. 
</p><p>"Our little girl is gone into the Unknown," she wrote &mdash; "that 
Unknown in which she seemed to be forever trying to pry.  We 
knew she was going, and we told her.  She was quite brave, but she 
begged us to try some way to keep her till after Christmas.  'My 
presents are not finished yet,' she made moan.  'And I did so want to 
see what I was going to have.  You can't have a very happy 
Christmas without me, I should think.  Can you arrange to keep me 
somehow till after then?'  We could not 'arrange' either with God in 
heaven or science upon earth, and she is gone." 
</p><p>She was only my little godchild, and I am an old maid, with no 
business fretting over children, but it seemed as if the medium of 
light and beauty had been taken from me.  Through this crystal soul 
I had perceived whatever was loveliest.  However, what was, was!  I 
returned to my home and took up a course of Egyptian history, and 
determined to concern myself with nothing this side the Ptolemies. 
</p><p>Her mother has told me how, on Christmas Eve, as usual, she 
and Elsbeth's father filled the stockings of the little ones, and hung 
them, where they had always hung, by the fireplace.  They had little 
heart for the task, but they had been prodigal that year in their 
expenditures, and had heaped upon the two tiny boys all the 
treasures they thought would appeal to them.  They asked 
themselves how they could have been so insane previously as to 
exercise economy at Christmas time, and what they meant by not 
getting Elsbeth the autoharp she had asked for the year before. 
</p><p>"And now &mdash;" began her father, thinking of harps.  But he 
could not complete this sentence, of course, and the two went on 
passionately and almost angrily with their task.  There were two 
stockings and two piles of 
   <pb n="532"/>  
toys.  Two stockings only, and only two piles of toys!  Two is very 
little! 
</p><p>They went away and left the darkened room, and after a time 
they slept &mdash; after a long time.  Perhaps that was about the time the 
tiny boys awoke, and, putting on their little dressing-gowns and bed 
slippers, made a dash for the room where the Christmas things were 
always placed.  The older one carried a candle which gave out a 
feeble light.  The other followed behind through the silent house. 
They were very impatient and eager, but when they reached the 
door of the sitting-room they stopped, for they saw that another 
child was before them. 
</p><p>It was a delicate little creature, sitting in her white night-gown, 
with two rumpled funny braids falling down her back, and she 
seemed to be weeping.  As they watched, she arose, and, putting out 
one slender finger as a child does when she counts, she made sure 
over and over again &mdash; three sad times &mdash; that there were only two 
stockings and two piles of toys!  Only those and no more. 
</p><p>The little figure looked so familiar that the boys started toward 
it; but just then, putting up her arm and bowing her face in it, as 
Elsbeth had been used to do when she wept or was offended, the 
little thing glided away and went out.  That's what the boys said.  It 
went out as a candle goes out. 
</p><p>They ran and woke their parents with the tale, and all the 
house was searched in a wonderment, and disbelief, and hope, and 
tumult!  But nothing was found.  For nights they watched.  But there 
was only the silent house.  Only the empty rooms.  They told the 
boys they must have been mistaken.  But the boys shook their 
heads. 
</p><p>"We know our Elsbeth," said they.  "It was our Elsbeth, cryin' 
'cause she hadn't no stockin' an' no toys, and we would have given 
her all ours, only she went out &mdash; jus' went out!" 
</p><p>Alack! 
</p><p>The next Christmas I helped with the little festival.  It was 
none of my affair, but I asked to help, and they let me, and when we 
were all through there were three stockings and three piles of toys, 
and in the largest one was all the things that I could think of that my 
dear child would love.  I locked the boys' chamber that night, and I 
slept on the divan in the parlor off the sitting-room.  I slept but little, 
and the night was very still &mdash; so windless and white and still that I 
think I must have heard the slightest noise.  Yet I heard none.  Had I 
been in my grave I think my ears would not have remained more 
unsaluted. 
</p><p>Yet when daylight came and I went to unlock the boys' 
bedchamber door, I saw that the stocking and all the treasures which 
I had bought for my little godchild were gone.  There was not a 
vestige of them remaining. 
</p><p>Of course we told the boys nothing.  As for me, after dinner I 
went home and buried myself once more in my history, and so 
interested was I that midnight came without my knowing it.  I 
should not have looked up at all, I suppose, to become aware of the 
time, had it not been for a faint, sweet sound as of a child striking a 
stringed instrument.  It was so delicate and remote that I hardly 
heard it, but so joyous and tender that I could not but listen, and 
when I heard it a second time it seemed as if I caught the echo of a 
child's laugh.  At first I was puzzled.  Then I remembered the little 
autoharp I had placed among the other things in that pile of 
vanished toys.  I said aloud: 
</p><p>"Farewell, dear little ghost.  Go rest.  Rest in joy, dear little 
ghost.  Farewell, farewell." 
</p><p>That was years ago, but there has been silence since.  Elsbeth 
was always an obedient little thing.
